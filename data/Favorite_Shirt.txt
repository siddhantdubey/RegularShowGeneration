(Episode begins at the now dome-sealed Park. Cut to Mordecai, Rigby and Fives pruning trees. Rigby grunts as he is pruning, and stops.)

Rigby: Aargh! Pruning's lame!

Mordecai: It wouldn't be so bad if Benson would buys some new tools. These things are like a hundred years old.

Rigby: Yeah! How come Muscle Man gets to do this the cool way?

Muscle Man: Uh, maybe because I'm highly trained, bro.

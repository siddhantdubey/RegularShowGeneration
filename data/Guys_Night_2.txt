(Episode starts at the bank on a cloudy day at the bank)

Bank manager: Your safety-deposit box, sir.

Nikolai: Thank you.

Bank manager: Do you need anything else?

Nikolai: (turns around) a little breathing.

(The bank manager walks to a safety deposit dox and grabs a gun. When Nikolai hears the sound of the gun, he runs and kicks the bank manager.)

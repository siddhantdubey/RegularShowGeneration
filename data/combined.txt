(Mordecai, CJ, Rigby and Eileen are watching "Mailin it in" on TV. A mailman stealthily delivers mail while dodging a bunch of dogs and a cat. The title screen is then shown)

Mordecai and Rigby: OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!! (Benson walks in, carrying mail)

Benson: Bill......bill......(finds a coupon) oohh, Bedtopia coupon! (he waves it around) Papa needs a new comforter! (winks and makes a clicking noise) You guys got a couple things too (hands Mordecai and Rigby two green envelopes)

Rigby: Man Benson, do that with a little less drama next time. (looks at envelope and passes one to Mordecai)

Mordecai: (takes envelope) Yeah, why can't you be more like the mail guys on T.V.?

Benson: Because....(facepalms) *sigh* (nods) I don't know (walks away)

Mordecai: Woah dude, check it out. (shows front of envelope) A square eeennveloooooppppee!

Eileen: (looks at Rigby's) Hand-caligraphed addresses?! (waves hand by face) Wooooh, things just got fancy in here!

Mordecai: (reading the invitation) Traffic's at a standstill due to a massive back up at the Smith residence.

Rigby: (continues reading the invitation) Some minor congestion is expected at the intersection of cake, fancy sodas, and a good time, as we celebrate the 1000th flight of Chopper 6.

Mordecai: (continues) We're not seeing any delays of an RSVP for you and one guest. (They both look confused, not knowing what its saying)

Rigby: (after a couple seconds) ....OH! It's a party, for Margaret's dad's 1000th ride on Chopper 6!

Eileen: And CJ and I can go too, right guys?! (Mordecai and CJ look worried)

Mordecai: Uuuuuuh......(Mordecai looks at CJ, looking nervous)

CJ: Oh! *clears throat* I promised some friends I'd volunteer at this river clean up thing that day.

Mordecai: Oh, well.......(everyone is silent for a moment)

CJ: (seeming a little frantic)......Just go without me! It sounds like it'll be really fun.

Rigby: OH *sighs in relief* 'Cause if you were there, and Margaret was there....(shudders in disgust) (fastly) Probably a lot less awkward this way-(gets punched by Mordecai) OW! DUDE! I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW!

CJ: Rigby's right, go, have fun (smiles).

Mordecai: (kind of in disbelief) Really?

CJ: I trust you.

Mordecai: (hugs her, extremely happy) AAAAAAAWWWHH! (pulls away a bit) I'll bring you a piece a' cake from the party for being the coolest girlfriend ever (they kiss)

(Scene cuts to Margaret's parent's house. They party is taking place in the backyard. Darrell and Robby, two of Margaret's cousins, are shown playing with two remote control helicopter toys. They make them collide into one another and they crash on the ground.)

Robby: (shooting and crashing noises while the helicopters crash) Chopper 6 down, Chopper 6 down!

Darrell: Hehehehehe (Then Denise walks by, holding a tray of drinks)

Denise: (scolding) That's not funny kids! (Mordecai, Rigby, and Eileen then walk in through the back gate)

Mordecai: Hi!

Denise: Oh hey guys! Glad you could make it. Ugh, can you believe it?! Margaret's still at work! She might not even make it at all!

Mordecai: (gets happy and smiles) Oooohh, bummer.

Denise: (sternly) You're smiling.

Mordecai: (stops smiling) Sorry, cheek cramp. (Then one of the remote control helicopters, the white one, crashes into the punch bowl)

Denise: (aggravated) Darrell, COME ON! You almost ruined our special order cake here!

Rigby: (The three look down at the cake on the table next to the bowl) That's a cake?!

Mordecai: CJ's gotta see this (He pulls out his phone and takes a picture of it. A second later, Frank can be heard)

Frank: Mordecai!

Mordecai: (looks up) Huh? Mr. Smith! (Frank walks over with Jackie Carmichael. He shakes Mordecai's hand, then gives him a hug. Mordecai is caught off guard by this) awwh..ehh!

Frank: (pulls away) Hahahaha! (pats his back) Want ya to meet my long time partner in the skies, Jackie Carmichael!

Jackie Carmichael: (elbows Frank) What a day, huh? I can't wait to find out who's gonna get that coveted extra seat in the 1000th Chopper flight!

Eileen: Extra seat?

Frank: There's one for my wife, one for my daughter, and one wild card!

Jackie Carmichael: (shrugs) Sure would mean a lot! Even more than the award I won for being the top traffic reporter in the city.

Denise: (pops up behind Frank and holds onto his chest, Jackie looks surprised) Frank has a lot of important people in his life, Jackie. Isn't that right Frank?

Frank: That's true hon. (Jackie gets angry and jealous and walks away) Haven't made up my mind yet about that extra seat.

Rigby: Have you considered your daughter's ex-boyfriend's best friend?

Mordecai: He's not gonna take you Rigby. (to Frank) Sorry. (slowly) Hey, do you mind if I get a piece of cake for CJ?

Frank: CJ?

Rigby: She's Mordecai's new girlfriend. Not totally new, but newer than Margaret. (Mordecai shoots Rigby an angry glare, then looks back at Frank)

Frank: (appears angry) *sigh* (Margaret then shows up through the back gate with the camera crew. She is reporting about her dad's party)

Margaret: Here we are now at the celebration of Frank Smith's 1000th chopper ride. (turns toward the party) Looks like quite a turn out! (Eileen waves at her)

Frank: (arms spread out) Hugbug, you came!

Margaret: (also has arms spread out) 'Course I did! (they hug, then pull apart. Frank's hand is on her shoulder)

Mordecai: Hi Margaret.

Margaret: Hi!

Frank: (Frank puts his other hand on Mordecai's shoulder and brings him in. He's got a mischevious look on his face. Mordecai looks worried) Your friend Mordecai here was just saying he has a new girlfriend named CJ.

Margaret: *scoffs* (looks embarrassed) Dad!

Mordecai: (gets uncomfortable) I, uh, have to go to the bathroom (runs away) 

Rigby: Oh no. Dude, wait up! (runs after him) 

Frank: ...Got any new hobbies, Eileen?

Eileen: Yeah, I do

(Scene now cuts to Mordecai in the bathroom. He's leaning on the sink, texting CJ. He sends the picture of the cake with the caption "Chopper Cake!". CJ sends back a smiley face, and texts back "River still super dirty but hope party's fun!" and a picture of her with a dirty bra and a disgusted look on her face.)

Mordecai: Hehe, gross. (Then someone knocks on the door, its Rigby)

Rigby: (only his voice is heard) You're being weird, Mordecai!

Mordecai: That's fine.

Rigby: (scene shows Rigby outside the door) Come ooon! You have to come out of the bathroom.

Mordecai: No I don't. Margaret's out there, so if I stay here then I won't mess things up. This is the choice of maturity.

Rigby: (only his voice) What about the cake?

Mordecai: (facepalms) Ugh, the cake. (Looks up and sighs) I'll come out when they cut the cake and then I'll leave.

Rigby: (showing him at the door) That's dumb dude! CJ told you to have fun! Just come out here, and I'll stick by you so nothing happens with Margaret. Then you can grab the cake, and better yet, your dignity. (Mordecai opens the door, Rigby smiles) 

Mordecai: You'll stay with me the whole time?

Rigby: Or until you actually have to go to the bathroom.

Mordecai: Thanks Rigby. (Rigby punches Mordecai. Mordecai looks really hurt) AHH! OW! (rubs arm)

Rigby: (frustrated expression) That's payback, for punching me on the couch! Let's go. (they start to walk)

Mordecai: (complaining) That was a really long time ago!

(A montage is then shown, in which Rigby "protects" Mordecai from "pulling a Mordecai". The two are seen talking to John, until they notice Margaret approaching. Rigby quickly eats a plateful of deviled eggs and shoves the plate towards Margaret. Rigby gives her a nervous smile, Margaret looks annoyed and walks away. Mordecai looks sad, while Rigby smirks to Mordecai, then holds his stomach. Next, Mordecai, Rigby, and Eileen are signing their names on the "Happy 1000th Chopper Flight" banner. Margaret is at the end of the table next to Mordecai. She smiles at him, then Mordecai looks at her nervously and looks at Rigby. Rigby quickly draws a line with his marker all the way to Margaret and sticks his rear towards her. She looks disgusted and walks away. Mordecai and Rigby have the same expressions as last time. Finally, Mordecai and Rigby are spinning Eileen around, playing "Pin the Tail on the Chopper". They stop spinning her and she walks towards the poster. Margaret walks behind Mordecai and Rigby, until two of her cousins run into her, causing her to bump into Mordecai. They look at each other, Margaret with an apologetic look and Mordecai with a fake, nervous smile. Rigby looks at them nervously and quickly grabs one of Margaret's cousins and shoves him towards Margaret. Margaret angrily looks at him, but he points towards Rigby. She looks at Rigby, but is too late because Mordecai and Rigby run away. Meanwhile, Eileen successfully pins the tail on the chopper and takes off her blind fold. She happily looks towards Mordecai and Rigby, but seeing that they left, is sad. All she sees is a blurred Margaret. Then the montage ends with Frank about to give a speech)

Frank: *clears throat* I'd like to say a few words before we cut the cake.

Mordecai: (looks at Rigby, both are smiling) Caaake.

Frank: (continues) (slowly) Chopper 6, Chopper 6, Chopper 6. (Normally) How many times have I said those words? Well at least nine hundred and ninety-nine plus the three just now, heh. It's been such an honor to patrol the skies so the people know which highways have less traffic and more car chases, (winks and points at someone) but I couldn't have done it alone.

Jackie Carmichael: (gives a huge smile)

Frank: I'd like to thank my baby girl Margaret, and my beautiful wife Denise (pats chest), for emotionally always being next to me in the Chopper (Margaret and Denise are shown standing next to each other. Jackie is a couple feet behind them, giving an angry expression) (points to the sky) Today I'd like for them to literally be next to me in the Chopper. Everyone else, please grab a slice of cake (gestures towards the cake) and join us in the front yard, while we make history! (Cuts the cake)

(Scene cuts to the front yard, where Margaret and Denise get into the chopper. Jackie is seen desperately getting to Frank, shoving past other people)

Jackie Carmichael: Frank! FRANK! (smiles) Aren't you forgetting somethin'?

Frank: Oh, right! The extra seat, heh. How can I forget?

Jackie Carmichael: (Jackie is so sure its her, that she begins to climb into the chopper) Aw, don't worry about it.

Frank: I reserved this seat for a very special person.

Mordecai: (Scene then shows Mordecai picking out a piece of cake for CJ, with Frank and the chopper in the background) Hmm......oh-(he's cut off by Frank)

Frank: Mordecai! (Mordecai looks surprised)

Jackie Carmichael: (gets off of the chopper).....Mordecai?

Mordecai: (turns towards the chopper) I, uh...

Jackie Carmichael: *scoffs* Nevermind that I won an award and I still don't get respect around here. (mumbling while walking away) These awards don't get anything for me.....(leaves)

Frank: (walks towards Mordecai) Sorry it got heated before. It's hard for me to accept that you and Margaret aren't together.

Mordecai: That's ok.

Frank: NO, it's not ok! You're family Mordecai...at least I consider you family. And I always will, whether or not you and Margaret are a couple.

Mordecai: Um...(looks down and sees the cakes are going fast) (slowly) Well...thank you...for that. (Frank then shoves a helmet towards Mordecai) OOF!

Frank: Haha! (puts hand on shoulder, Mordecai looks uncomfortable) Now go grab a piece of cake for your girlfriend JC before it disappears. 'Cause the flight of a lifetime's about to take off! (walks away)

Mordecai: (grabs a piece of cake, Rigby appears, already stuffing his face) Hey Rigby, can I trust you to hold this piece of cake for me without eating it?

Rigby: Dude...(shrugs) its cake!

Mordecai: *sighs* Never mind. (walks to the chopper and goes on it. The chopper takes off. The chopper shakes, causing the cake to almost fall off the plate) (nervously) Woooaah, WOOOAAUUGGH! (he gets icing on his wing) Ugh.

Margaret: (points at the mess) Should've brought a napkin, too huh?

Mordecai: (awkward speaking gibberish) Aaauugghh......

Margaret: (continues) How are things at the Park?

Mordecai: (continues speaking gibberish) (looking all around) Nnnnhh...aaaaOOUUHH! (the open door of the Chopper is shown)

Margaret: (notices the awkwardness) Dude!

Mordecai: UUUUUUGGGGHHHH!

Margaret: Why are you being so weird? I know a lot's happened, but I thought we were cool now?

Mordecai: Yeah......(looks down) no, it's still weird.

Margaret: (frustrated) Well what's it gonna take?! (puts hands in air) This is a party! (happier) We're on Chopper 6's THOUSANDTH ride! Can't we just try to have fun like we used to?

Mordecai: Yeah, I guess you're right. (Makes radio noises) We had a six car pile up around Christmas, but now we're not seeing any delays as we make our way north through the clouds. 

Mordecai and Margaret: Hahahaha!

Frank: (at the driver's seat) That's some solid traffic reporting son! Where'd ya learn that?

Denise: Aw Frank! (to Mordecai and Margaret) He thinks it takes skill to do what he does.

Mordecai and Margaret: (look at each other) Hahahaha!

(Back on the ground, everyone watches the chopper fly in the air. Rigby and Eileen are standing there, watching as well)

Eileen: (while holding a piece of cake) How long are we supposed to watch it? (Just then CJ shows up)

CJ: Guess I missed the launch? (both face towards her)

Rigby: CJ!

Eileen: Oh cool, you made it! What happened at the river clean up?

CJ: They send us home after someone got chemical burns from the water. (Look around) Where's Mordecai? (Eileen points to the chopper, CJ looks up and sees Mordecai and Margaret laughing together)....Mordecai? (they keep laughing as the chopper flies around in a circle in its one spot)

Mordecai: (looks out and sees CJ on the ground, looking devastated) *gasp* Uhh...I can't be here, I-I gotta hang with CJ. (Tries to take off his seat belt. Margaret looks at him, worried. He takes off his seat belt and stands up) (yelling) CJ! Hi! (the chopper jerks, making Mordecai lose balance and fall on Margaret's lap. CJ gets angry)

CJ: Aw, come on! (turns grey) Did you think I wouldn't find out?! That you could just make a fool of me forever?! (Turns into a full on stormcloud and flies towards the chopper) This is the LAST TIME! (As CJ threatens, the camera crew is recording the whole thing) 

Guy: Are you getting this Glen? (They run towards the scene)

CJ: (blows some wind) RRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUGGGHHHHH! (Amongst the chaos, she blows Robby and Darrell's toy helicopters and they're slammed into the camera crew. She continues her rampage, shaking the chopper like crazy) RRRRRRAAAAAAAUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH!!!

Mordecai: (Yelling above the wind) CJ, it's not what you think! There was an extra seat!

Frank: (yelling) Is everyone ok back there?!

Denise: (only her voice, painfully hurt, also yelling) We're fine-OOF!

Margaret: (only her voice, yelling) MOM!!

Mordecai: (only his voice, yelling) Woah, are you ok?!

Frank: (presses a bunch of buttons, putting on autopilot and joins the others, angry) What's with your new girlfriend Mordecai?!

Mordecai: (worried) I don't know! I guess we're having another misunderstanding?

Frank: (still angry) No son of mine would bring this to my 1000th Chopper Flight Party!

Mordecai: But I'm not your son!

(CJ starts to shoot lightning and shakes the chopper more. This causes Frank and Denise to fall out of the chopper, holding onto each other)

Frank and Denise: aaaaAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!

Margaret: (scared and frantic) MOM! DAD! (takes off her seat belt)

Frank: (yelling) You're right to be concerned, Margaret but it's gonna be ok! I'm a professional! (to Denise) Grab your knees hon.

Frank and Denise: MANNONBALL!! (they land in the pool, but look like they have broken bones)

Denise: It really does take skill to do what you do.

Mordecai: (Mordecai and Margaret are still in the Chopper, with CJ still creating her storm. Margaret is calming herself down and taking deep breaths after almost losing her parents) It's ok, they made it.

Margaret: Yeah, but what about us?

(CJ continues to cause trouble. She strikes lightning near the Smith house, and everyone runs away)

Mordecai: CJ, please! (He stumbles and accidentally shoves the cake into Margaret's mouth. CJ gets even MORE angry at this. She shakes the chopper again, which cuts some of a tree. Margaret falls down and grabs an air horn. She then almost falls out of the chopper) 

Margaret: AAAHH!!

Mordecai: MARGARET, NOOO! (he then throws the plate and whatever is left of the cake out of the chopper. Margaret grabs onto the chopper's bar with one wing. CJ gets mad because the cake plummets down to the ground)

CJ: (She strikes the chopper with more lightning) RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!

Mordecai: CJ, LISTEN TO ME, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK!!! REALLY!!!

Margaret: (using the air horn) MORDECAI IS TELLING YOU THE TRUTH! HE'S TOLD YOU THE TRUTH, LIKE, A HUNDRED TIMES! WE'RE. JUST. FRIENDS!! 

CJ: WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?!

Margaret: (angry) BECAUSE! I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!

Mordecai: (hurt).......You have a boyfriend?

Frank: (disappointed) You have a boyfriend?!

CJ: (slowly realizing) YOU.....have..a boyfriend??

Margaret: (still using air horn) Look! He just showed up!

Del Hanlon: (locks car) Yowsa! Should've grabbed my windbreaker off the sailboat!

Rigby: (amazed) Weekend sports anchor Del Hanlon?!

Del Hanlon: Hey Eileen! (Rigby's surprised he knows Eileen)

Eileen: Hey! (Rigby looks at her, surprised)

Del Hanlon: Heeeeeyy Margaret!

Mordecai: (looks shocked, turns around and shuts his eyes) uuuuggghhh...

Margaret: There's nothing to be upset about here!

CJ: (still in storm cloud mode) But....you...so you don't....? (She slowly retracts into her normal form) (ashamed) ....Oh no....(covers face)

Mordecai: (flips the switch labeled "auto land" on. The chopper lands, and Margaret gets off)

Margaret: (waves) Hey Del!

Del Hanlon: Margaret (they quickly hug)

Margaret: All the cake's gone, but we still have some snacks.

Del Hanlon: Oooh, that's ok. I don't pollute my body with refined sugar anyway.

Mordecai: (looks at them and half smiles. He picks up what is left of the cake. Soft, mellow music plays) *sighs*

CJ: *sniff*, *soft crying*

Mordecai: ....CJ?

CJ: (slow, depressed tone, has her back to him) I'm not really in the mood for cake, right now.

Mordecai: I'm sorry. I mean, I did what you asked me to do, so.....but then...

CJ: Don't. (Turns towards him) This time it was my fault. Margaret's parents almost died because I freaked out about nothing!

Mordecai: Yeah....that did happen.

CJ: (about to break down) *sniff* I have to go! *sniff* *soft crying*

(Mordecai turns around and watches her go. He is joined by Margaret, Del, Rigby, and Eileen)

Rigby: (gesturing towards the cake) Dude, is it cool if I eat the rest of that? (Mordecai just gives it to him. The soft music keeps playing as the whole mess is shown)

Problems noted: Format

(Episode starts with all the park members are sitting on the steps of Pops' house while Benson is announcing at the front.)

Benson: All right, everyone, quiet down. We all got to setup for a band that's playing at the park tonight.

(Park members chatter)

Mordecai: What band, Benson?

Benson: It's not important.

Mordecai: What's the matter? We only want to know what band.

Benson: Hair to the Throne.

(All park workers except Benson gasp)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hair to the Throne?!

Rigby: One of the greatest living bands to ever live is coming to the Park?!

Muscle Man: This is huge. Hair to the Throne got me though high school.

(All park workers except Benson get psyched talking about it)

Mordecai: You got to tell us everything!

Rigby: Yeah! Do we get to meet them?

Muscle Man: How about backstage passes?

Mordecai: Are they gonna play the sweet drum solo off their first album?

Rigby: The most epic drum solo in history.

Mordecai: You've heard it, right?

Rigby: I guess you're kind of out of touch, huh?

(Benson turns red)

Mordecai: Don't worry. You can totally borrow my --

Benson: Oh, I've heard it because it was me! I performed that drum solo!

(After a short pause, Mordecai and Rigby laugh)

Mordecai: Get real, Benson.

Rigby: Yeah, we know you used to be in a band or whatever, but there's no way you played that solo.

Benson: Oh, just because I'm some lame, old park manager, I can't do it?

Mordecai: (scoffs) Yeah. That solo features a hundred and fifty pieces of percussion.

Skips: It's too advanced for anyone to play.

Benson: It is not!

Rigby: It's dangerous for a person to play. I heard some guy in Denmark tried, (he raises his arms) and his skeleton caught on fire! (Mordecai nods.)

Benson: How about I play the solo then?

Mordecai: What?

Benson: That's right. If you want to hear some real drumming and not some artificial garbage, I'll be performing the legendary solo right before the concert.

(The band's bus shows up, and a bunch of screaming fans are running towards it. All park workers, except Benson, run to the bus as well.)

Rigby: Oh, look, they're here!

Benson: UGH!

Muscle Man: Out of the way, losers. (He pushes fans out of the way)

(The park workers approach the band.)

Oggy: You must be the park workers.

Rigby: Yeah, dude.

Mordecai: Of course, we know you guys. Gunner Von Strauss, lead guitar. Oggy Ogostrom, lead vocals. The bass player. (The bass player frowns.)

Rigby: But where's the-- (He gasps as some sort of a machine comes out of the bus.) No way! The Drumotron VI! (He says it as the letters V-I and not the Roman numeral six.)

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi Five Ghost: Ooh!

(The Drumotron VI performs a drum fill)

Skips: That was the most realistic drum fill I've ever heard.

Benson: (scoffs) That fill was a joke. Tell them, Oggy. Tell them the Drumotron is ripping off my solo.

Oggy: (sighs) You never played that drum solo, Benson.

Gunner: The Drumotron VI played that solo -- always has, always will.

Oggy: Anyway, it's impossible to play.

Benson: Yeah? Well, I'm gonna play it before the concert. I'm gonna show the world the truth.

Hair to the Throne: Ooh!

Oggy: Oi, what happened to your hair, Benson?

Benson: IT'S HEREDITARY!

Oggy: Ha! Yeah, look at this chrome dome.

Benson: Chrome dome?

(The Drumotron VI copies what Benson said and electronically speeds it up. The Park workers are impressed, while Benson is umimpressed.)

Mordecai: Cool.

Gunner: Now, we have a surprise for you lot. We're making you our honorary roadies.

(Everyone except Benson takes backstage passes from the band, excited.)

Rigby: Yeah! This is the best!

(Benson groans)

Gunner: (waves the last pass tauntingly, in a singsong voice) Benson?

(Benson slaps the pass out of Gunner's hand)

Benson: UGH!!! I'M NOT YOUR ROADIE! (to Mordecai and Rigby) Mordecai and Rigby, come on. You're helping me get the rest of my kit.

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what? But honorary roadies.

Benson: I'm still your boss. I'm not asking. I'm telling. Now, come on! (walks away)

(Both Mordecai and Rigby groan and follow Benson)

Oggy: (calling) You're making a huge mistake, Benson. You're only gonna embarrass yourself!

(The scene then cuts to Mordecai, Rigby and Benson are at the storage center. Benson opens a garage door to reveal his enormous drum kit.)

Benson: Well, there it is. The 150-piece kit I used to play that solo. Are you clowns even listening to me? (Mordecai and Rigby chuckle, amused by their honorary roadie passes) Oh, come on. It can't be that interesting.

Rigby: (holding the backstage pass) But it's holographic. (He moves the pass, upon which its image changes)

Mordecai: Besides, having a bunch of drums doesn't mean you did the solo.

Benson: Just try and focus. We only have a few hours, and I really need your help.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan)

(Hair to the Throne are doing their soundcheck; Pops and Skips are helping out while the fan girls are admiring the Drumotron VI. Mordecai and Rigby are exhausted while carrying the 150 piece kit to the park truck. Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Skips and Pops are admiring the soundcheck and Thomas presses a button to activate the fireworks. Mordecai and Rigby see this in the distance while holding a drum.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Wh-o-o-o-oa!

Benson: Hurry up! We've got a dozen more of these to haul, each one heavier than the last.

Mordecai: Uh, we should probably get going, Benson.

Benson: What?

Rigby: You seem to have this covered.

Mordecai: Yeah, see ya.

(Mordecai and Rigby run away)

Benson: Hey, get back here! (He tosses the hi hat cymbal to the ground) Come back and help me, or you're fired! I can't... do this alone. (sigh)

(Mordecai and Rigby run back to the stage where the Hair to the Throne members are standing.)

Oggy: Oh good, you guys are back. Here to help out?

Mordecai: Yeah, we are.

Oggy: The show's about ready to start. We just need a hand with one thing.

Mordecai: Sure, dude. Anything.

(The Hair to the Throne members chuckle)

Rigby: What's so funny?

(Mordecai shrugs and Rigby and Mordecai chuckle nervously alongside the Hair to the Throne. Scene pans to Benson setting up the 150-piece kit in the park)

Benson: All right. Just a few more trips and my kit will be back to its former glory, and then I'll show them who can play that drum solo.

(Benson drives away to the storage to collect the rest of the kit in the truck. Just as he leaves, Mordecai and Rigby are driving Hair to the Throne with the golf cart and arrive at the 150-piece kit assemblance.)

Mordecai: So, why do you guys want a ride here?

Oggy: No reason.

(Hair to the Throne laugh and Gunner and the Bass Player hold up weapons. Cut to Benson driving in his truck on his way back to the 150-piece kit, imitating drum beats.)

Benson: Yeah! I'll show them. (He gasps as he arrives at the 150-piece kit, which Hair to the Throne is destroying.)

Rigby: Stop!

Mordecai: You guys are supposed to be cool!

Oggy: We are cool. That's why we destroyed that loser's drum kit.

Gunner and Bass Player: Ooh!

Mordecai: No way. I don't care how good your first album was. You're just a bunch of jerks.

Oggy: Fine. If that's how you feel, we're officially stripping you of your unofficial roadies status.

(Mordecai and Rigby take off their honorary roadie passes and throw them to the ground.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Fine!

Oggy: Don't bother showing up to the concert. Hair to the Throne, out.

(Hair to the Throne get into the golf cart, drive in circles and drive away. Mordecai and Rigby walk up to Benson)

Mordecai: (sighs) Benson, are you okay?

Rigby: Can you still perform the solo?

Benson: (throws broken drum to ground) Of course I can. But what does it matter if my kit's busted? No one cares I play this thing anyways.

Mordecai: We care. What if we help you fix it?

(Benson smiles. Hair to the Throne are starting their concert, and amongst the audience is Skips, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Thomas and Pops cheering. During this, Mordecai, Rigby and Benson are fixing, assemlbing and polishing the 150 Piece Kit. Benson puts his sweat band on his head. Scene changes back to the stage.)

Oggy: Are we having a good time, park? (He holds his microphone to the audience, which cheers) And now, playing the most impossible drum solo IN THE WORLD... (Fog fills the stage as a countdown begins.)

Oggy and the audience: Five, four, three, two, one!

Oggy: ...The Drumotron VI! (He points to where the fog has cleared to reveal, instead of the Drumotron VI, just part of Benson's entire 150-piece drum kit.)

(audience gasps)

Audience member: Hey, who's that?

Oggy: Benson?!

(Mordecai and Rigby are seen with the person in charge of the Drumotron VI all tied up to the ground. They nod to Benson, and Benson nods in response.)

Benson: (echoing) Years ago, something was taken from me. And now I stand before you to reclaim it. My name is Benson! And I can play this SOLO!

(Benson activates an arm switch and presses a fire button)

Oggy: What the...?

(A buzzer sounds. The surroundings in front of Benson explode throwing the Hair to the Throne members from their places. The rest of the 150 Piece Kit is revealed rising from the ground.)

Thomas: Whoa.

(Benson spins drum sticks in his hands)

Oggy: No! If anyone finds out that he can play this drum solo, we're ruined! (Benson commences his 150-piece drum kit solo.) Stop him!

(Gunner and the Bass Player run up to Oggy; the three go forth to attack the 150-piece kit, but Mordecai and Rigby block the way. Skips, Pops, Thomas, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are in the front of the audience.)

Skips: He's really doing it.

(The Park members get on stage and fight Hair to the Throne. Benson keeps doing the solo and the audience gasps in amazement and cheer as Benson proceeds onto the next part. The audience chants Benson's name.The top of the Drumotron VI turns into a creature and is approaching the 150-piece kit. The park members are keeping Hair to the Throne down to the ground.)

Mordecai: What the...? (The park members are trying to attack the Drumotron VI but cannot get to it as the Drumotron VI shoots a laser. The Hair to the Throne members punch Skips, Mordecai and Rigby [who were holding the band members down] and get away.) Benson, watch out!

(Benson is still doing the solo. The Drumotron VI runs up to Benson, who is now on fire, and jumps onto a section of the drum kit which Benson has just finished playing and explodes, and Hair to the Throne and the Drumotron VI run up to the 150-piece kit.)

Oggy: Not the MIDI controller!

(Hair to the Throne and the Drumotron VI destroy the sections of the 150 Piece Kit as Benson just finished playing them. Benson gets into a crane lift and is lifted up into the sky. The park members cheer for Benson along with the audience.)

Benson: Clear the way!

(The audience makes way for Benson and the lift. Mordecai and Rigby, who are on stage, gasp. A giant gong detatches from the bottom of the crane lift and bongs onto the floor.)

Mordecai and Rigby: The gong!

Gunner: But that can only mean...

(Benson puts on a safety harness and is lifted higher in the sky)

Oggy: 360-degree ascending sky cage?! (The Bass Player and Gunner scream. Benson is seen in the lift spinning 360 degrees and doing the drum solo) No worries, mate! There's no way you can fit a gamelan on...

(Benson plays the gamelan and Hair to the Throne screams. The Drumotron VI flies up to Benson. The park members run closer to where Benson is and cheer for him.)

Park members: Yeah, Benson!

Rigby: Past the point of no return.

(The Drumotron VI looks down on Benson on top of the lift; the audience chants Benson's name.)

Benson: All right, it's time to finish this. (The Drumotron VI jumps onto Benson's free hand and Benson tries to shake it off. The park members, as well as the members of Hair to The Throne except Oggy are looking shocked. Benson is struggling to shake the Drumotron VI off and Benson's skeleton catches fire.) MY... SKELETON!

(The Drumotron lets go because of the heat and is thrown acrosss the lift. Benson pulls a switch and the lift goes down and the flames grow bigger. The lift hits the gong on the ground and the sound waves it produces are so strong it breaks the lights of the stage and blows the audience away. The audience cheers and chants Benson's name again. The park members run to Benson who is in the ditch the lift made.)

Mordecai: That was amazing!

Rigby: You did it, man! You really did it!

Mordecai: We're sorry for doubting you.

Skips: All of us.

Benson: I told you.

Oggy: Benson, we're sorry, mate. It was pretty uncool of us to throw you out of the band and lie about you. We know that now. You're the heart and soul of the band, Benson. Please, come back.

Benson: No, Oggy. I don't need rock 'n' roll's endless party 'cause the park is my rock, and managing it is my role. (He picks up his clipboard from the floor) Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get back to work. (He walks away.)

(The park members follow Benson out of the ditch.)

Mordecai: Dude, what the heck, man?

Rigby: I know, right? Working at the park blows.

Mordecai: I guess we'll never understand that guy.

(Benson picks up rubbish and tosses it in the park bin behind him and walks away into the sunrise with the audience standing and making way for Benson.)

(Beginning Credits)

Clerk 2 [Sam Marin]: (over black screen) How much longer? This is so... boring.

Clerk 1 [JG Quintel]: It's only two more hours, dude.

Clerk 2: (sigh) Two more hours. (beat) Two more hours. (beat) (sigh) Two more hours... f--k.

(Cut to counter with two clerks)

Clerk 1: Dude, want some candy?

Clerk 2: (Groggily) Eh, nah. No thanks.

Clerk1:Aw, come on. It's Halloween. 

Clerk 2:(off screen) Eh, hmm. 

Clerk 1:Come on. You... you gotta have candy, man. You've gotta have candy on Halloween. It's Halloween.

Clerk 2: Eh.

Clerk 1:(close-up) Dude... candy?

Clerk 2: Arugh... Oh, alright. 

Clerk 1:Ha ha ha! Yeah-yuh!

(Clerk 1 takes two candy pieces out of his pocket and both begin chewing.)

Clerk 2:(suspicious) I think there's something wrong with this candy.

Clerk 1: Uh, wh... what do you mean? What are you talking about?

Clerk 2: I don't know, it tastes funny.

Clerk 1: Huh. Hmm. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. Huh, huh, yeah. That's because I put drugs in it.

Clerk 2: What? Why? Uh... What's wrong with you?

Clerk 1: Uh, geez. I'm sorry. I.. I thought...

Clerk 2: Whoa, huh! You thought wrong. I mean, what did you put in these things anyway?

Clerk 1: It's.. It's just a little marijuana. It's just a little marijuana.

Clerk 2: (softly) Weed candy. You put weed in a candy bar.

Clerk 1: Oh, oh no, wait! Ha ha! No, no, I remember now. Don't worry, dude, I didn't put any weed in this candy. It was acid.

Clerk 2: (spits out candy) What? Acid? What the f--k is wrong with you?

Clerk 1: I'm... I'm sorry.

Clerk 2: I mean, you said that like acid is safer than weed. You know it's not, right?

Clerk 1: Yes. Yeah, uh. Yeah, I knew. Sorry, I... I don't know why I said that.

Clerk 2: (loud sigh) I've never done acid before. I didn't want to do acid. But even if I did, I'd much rather be told about it than slipped some stupid milk chocolate Mickey.

Clerk 1:  Look, I'm sorry, okay? I really am, but what's done is done. My advice, at this point, just calm down and enjoy it. You know what I mean? Seriously, man, it's too late.

Clerk 2: (sigh) I guess you're right. Well...(clerk morphs into proto-Benson) when's it supposed to kick in?

Clerk 1: (shocked, then excited) Right f--king now!

Proto-Benson: What?

Clerk 1: (laughs) Look in the window.

Proto-Benson: (turns to window and sees reflection) What the f--k?  Uh... This is crazy. Come on, that's not me. That's not me. If this crap f--ks up my brain I'm gonna kill you, man.

Clerk 1: (laughs) 

Proto-Benson: (sigh) This...this is stupid. I'm a gumball machine.

Clerk 1: Come on, it's supposed to be fun.

Proto-Benson: This? (turns crank on his chest, dispenses gumball, then he chews and swallows it) Not fun, man.

Clerk 1:(off screen, while reaching for the crank) Aw, cool...

Proto-Benson:(slaps his hand away) F--k off! 

Clerk 1: (head has changed into toast?) Hey, this isn't my fault, alright? 

Proto-Benson:(morphs into housefly) Hm. Not your fault, huh?

Clerk 1: (morphs into proto-Pops) Not my fault.

Clerk 2: (his regular head inflates into a balloon) Not your fault.

Clerk 1: (has morphed into a dolphin) Heaheaheaheahea!

(both clerks have morphed into dolphins and loudly click and whistle for a few seconds before Clerk 2 is splashed morphing him into a bear)

Clerk 2: Okay, okay. Stop it. (morphs back into Proto-Benson)

Proto-Benson: This is too... weird.

(Clerk 1 has moprhed into proto-Mordecai with a fanny-pack)

Proto-Mordecai: Uh... Yeah... This is, uh, getting a little weird for my tastes. (Zipper on fanny-pack opens) Especially right now.

Proto-Benson: What are we going to do when someone comes in for gas? We can't help people when were like this. (his face swirls for a split-second) We can't help people when were like this.

Proto-Mordecai: Yeah we can.

Proto-Benson: No, were gonna get fired over this crap.

Proto-Mordecai: Look...Look just calm down. It's two in the morning, nobody's coming in for gas right now. Okay? Okay?

(service bell rings, both duck underneath counter)

(they look outside to see a car about to put a gas pump nozzle into a man's butt, but stop to look in the window)

Proto-Benson: (panicking) What do we do? What do we do?

Proto-Mordecai: Just, shut up. Just shut up for a second. I have to think. Uh.

Proto-Benson: S--t, what do we do? What do we do? F--k, what do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?

Proto-Mordecai: Oh! Okay. Okay, I got it. I got it.

Proto-Benson: What?

Proto-Mordecai: We just have to concentrate on what we're supposed to look like, and then we'll switch back.

Proto-Benson: (doubtful) What?

Proto-Mordecai: I heard it makes it wear off faster.

Proto-Benson: You are so full of s--t.

Proto-Mordecai: Do you have a better idea?

Proto-Benson: (sigh) Fine.

(montage of proto-Benson and proto-Mordecai falling through space as they try and concentrate on switching back)

(front entrance door opens ringing a bell, both clerks have morphed back to their normal selves.)

Clerk 1: Shh! Shh! (softly) Just be cool, just be cool. It worked, alright? Shh! Shh! Shh!

(Clerk 1 stands up and brushes himself off before realizing the customer is a police officer)

Policeman: How's it going, fellas?

Clerk 1: Good. Good.

Clerk 2: Uh, it's kinda slow. Yeah.

Policeman: I hear that. But it is Halloween. Everyone tends to be on foot.

Clerks 1&2: (nervously) Uh. Yeah. (laughs) Yeah. Uh... Yeah.

Policeman: Hey! (suspiciously) You two staying outta trouble?

Clerks1&2: (glup) 

(beat)

Policeman: Ha! I'm just messing with you. I just need a little midnight snack. (holds up a bag of chips) (off screen) How much do I owe you?

Clerk 2: (shakes head quickly) Okay, that'll be 1.24.

(register rings)

Policeman: (sigh) (starts eating chips, then stops)

(beat)

Policeman: These chips are a little stale.

Clerk 1: Oh! Do...Do you want-

Policeman: No, no. It's fine. 

(beat, clerks look at each other then back at police officer)

Policeman: (mouth opens wide, inhaling entire bag of chips)

Clerks 1&2: (screaming) Ahhh! 

(a whirlwind is created inside store while police officer takes his head off, sits on it, then flies through doors shattering the glass)

(clerks 1&2 dumbfounded as they stare at hole left by the police officer)

Clerk 1: Shh! Shh! Shh! Do you hear that?

Clerk 2: (frightened) What? What?

Clerk 1: (looking at Clerk 2, passes gas loudly)

Clerk 2: (sigh) I... f--king hate you.

Clerk 1: Aw, come on. It's supposed to be fun.

(cuts to credits)

Mordecai: Dude, hurry up! The show's coming back on!

Rigby: Hang on, I gotta get my oats.

Mordecai: Dude, use a bowl.

Rigby: Shut it! I'll eat my oats however my mouth feels like it.

(Rigby sticks a chocolate cake in with the oats and eats it)

Rigby (continued): Hmm hmmm.

Mordecai: Ugh.

TV Announcer: And now, back to Behind the Bands with Adrenaline! Pierce , John Moore, Ricky Grant, And frontman... Ace Balthazar!

Ace Balthazar: 1, 2, 3, 4...!

TV Announcer: They were the most epic band of all time...in 1984!

[Ricky Grant: Bass]

Ricky Grant: Yeah. We were pretty up with our guests... but it was Ace they came to see. He was real, man. [guitar noise]

Ace Balthazar: I've got an Adrenaline rush, and I think I'm gonna--!!!

Crowd: Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash!

Mordecai and Rigby: Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash!

Ace Balthazar: AAAARGHHH!!!

Crowd: Whooo!

[John Moore: Keyboard]

John Moore: For Ace, crashing just wasn't part of the show. It was a way of life.

Ace Balthazar: I think I'm gonna - CRASH! [knocks table over and makes a mega-mess of things] CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! [We see Adrenaline at their Jacuzzi, with Ace letting out his frustrations on the water] CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!

At RV:  [laughing]

Ricky Grant: Wait. Where's Ace? 

Ace Balthazar: CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!

(The Adrenaline tour bus, courtesy of crush-happy Ace, goes over cliff, crashes into road. All three members minus Ace were lucky to walk away from the crash)

Adrenaline: Come on, we've gotta get outta here! RUN!!!

(The RV goes BOOM!)

[Pierce Fesner: Drums]

Pierce Fesner: When we lost Ace, we knew the Adrenaline Rush was over. There'll never be another performer like Ace. Ever.

Rigby: Hmm. Hmm. True facts.

Mordecai: Dude! I wish we could've seen them play live. It would've been the most epic concert ever.

TV Announcer: Though he was presumed dead, Ace's body was never found. Could Ace be alive and walking among us? 

Woman: He ain't dead. I seen him at the shop-mart.

Man 1: My friend's brother saw him at the bus station.

Fat Man: I saw him on my quesadilla.

TV Announcer: A recent sighting has even been captured on film. [Knight seen creeping near bushes, Pops's House seen in background]

Rigby: Haha. That looks like our house in the background.

Mordecai: Dude, that is our house.

Rigby: Wait, is that..?

Mordecai: Dude, it's that guy who thinks he's a knight.

(Knight and Ace on split screen)

TV Announcer: Could this man be the real Ace Balthazar?

Rigby: Duuuuuude. (cuts out a knight's helmet and positions it on Ace Balthazar's view) Ace Bathazar's in our Park!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooooaaaahh!

Mordecai: Dude, I bet if we get him back together with his band, they'd play live and we get backstage passes!

Rigby: They'd totally give us backstage passes.

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta get him back together with his band.

(Cut to the creek where the knight lives. He places an old fax printer in front of him)

Knight: Now, to see what you are made of.

(He starts laughing as he repeatedly bashes the printer with his sword. We pan over to the bushes where Morrdecai and Rigby are watching him.)

Rigby: Dude, it's him! It's Ace!

Mordecai: Ye-ace it is!

(They start running over to him.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ace! Ace! Ace! Ace!

Knight: Oh! Natives of the new world!

Mordecai: Ace! Oh, man. It's an honor to meet you, sir.

Knight: Ace? What is this "Ace"?

Rigby: Dude, you're Ace Balthazar from Adrenaline!

Knight: What? I am not Ace Balthazar! I am Sir Gablethorp of Kingdonium! My quest is to discover the marvels of the new world. For instance, to find the tiny artists that live within this printing device.

(He resumes smashing the printer, Mordecai and Rigby stare at him.)

Rigby: Dude, there's something seriously wrong with Ace.

Mordecai: I know. I think that bus crash must've messed up his memory.

(Rigby pulls out a mixtape called "Jog It!: Adrenaline's Hits".)

Rigby: Hmm, hmm! Time to, "jog it", then!

(He puts it in a boombox and the mixtape plays, which shocks Gablethorp.)

Sir Gablethorp: What is this music? And how do you have a whole band of men inside such a small box?

Rigby: It's not just any band of men, it's Adrenaline!

Sir Gablethorp: Adrenaline?

(He raises his sword up.)

Sir Gablethorp (continued): I must meet this tiny band of men!

Mordecai and Rigby: No, wait!

(Gablethorp begins crashing the boombox. He soon stops.)

Sir Gablethorp: Where did the tiny band of men go?

Rigby: Dude, Ace Balthazar just trashed our boombox!

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoooooaaaaaa!

Sir Gablethorp: Oooohhhhh!

Mordecai: Ace, we wanna get you back together with your old band.

Rigby: Yeah, we're huge fans. And we wanna see your perform live!

Sir Gablethorp: (to himself) If pretending to be Ace Balthazar will get them to accept me, then so be it. (to Mordecai and Rigby) Friends, I just remembered that I am Ace Balthazar!

Mordecai and Rigby: Haha, I knew it!

Mordecai: Now all we gotta do is get you back together with your band.

(We cut to the residence of the members of Adrenaline, who are in a hottub, watching and reminiscing their time with Ace Balthazar.)

Ricky: Those were the days.

Pierce: What I wouldn't give to see Ace walk through our door right now.

(Jenkins comes through the door.)

Jenkins: There's a guy out here claiming to be Ace.

Ricky: Alright, bring him in.

(Mordecai and Rigby walk in with the Knight.)

Sir Gablethorp: Hello all! It is I, Ace Balthazar!

(The band members say nothing.)

Ricky: Jenkins, please escort these guys out.

(He proceeds to, but is stopped by Mordecai.)

Mordecai: No, wait! It really is Ace! Just look at him!

(Mordecai walks him up next to Ace's portrait. The Knight smiles nervously. The band members take a hard look.)

John: Eh Ricky, he does kinda look like Ace.

Ricky: That may be, but you sure don't dress or act like him. Besides, it's a known fact that Ace died in that crash. Pierce, play Track 4 of Adrena-geddon, backwards!

(Pierce takes out a remote and plays it backwards on the stereo.)

Ace: This is Ace Balthazar speaking, and I will totally die in a tour bus crash.

(It ends. Mordecai, Rigby and the Kinght are thrown out by the guards.)

Mordecai: Don't worry, Ace. We'll change you back in your old self. Then they'll believe it's you for sure.

(We cut to Two Peaks Mall, where Mordecai and Rigby find clothes for the Knight.)

Mordecai (continued): First thing's first. We need to find you something cool to wear.

Sir Gablethorp: What is wrong with my armor?

Rigby: Dude, burlap isn't cool?

Mordecai: You know what else isn't cool? Not wearing pants.

(We see Ace's leggings.)

Mordecai (continued): If you want people to recognise you, you gotta start dressing like your old self.

(He hands Gablethorp a set of clothing.)

Sir Gablethorp: If it is as you culture dictates, (takes clothes) then I will don the garb that is necessary to do so.

Rigby: Whatever. Just try the clothes on.

(Gablethorp goes into the changing room, and after trying three outfits, he comes out as the style of Ace. We cut to Pops' house.)

Sir Gablethorp: No! No!

(In the kitchen, Margaret and Eileen are with Mordecai, Rigby and Gablethorp, fashion supplies on the table.)

Sir Gablethorp (continued): I simply will not allow it! I will stand for these artisans to rouge my face.

(Margaret and Eileen hold up a brush and hair dryer, respectively.)

Sir Gablethorp (continued): But to remove my helmet?! I refuse! A helmet is a knight's honor!

Mordecai: Well, hair is a rockstar's honor.

Rigby: Yeah, man. No hair, no honor.

Eileen: It's the only way to be a rockstar.

Sir Gablethorp: Well, if that is your custom, then so be it.

(He removes his helmet, and Mordecai and Rigby scream at the sight of his hair. It's revealed to be long and undone white hair.)

Margaret: Uhh, this is gonna take a while.

(Cut to the guys in the living room. Margaret and Eileen walk out.)

Margaret (continued): (chuckles) Presenting Ace Balthazar.

(Gablethorp walks in with full appearance as Ace Balthazar.)

Mordecai: Woah!

Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai: Margaret and Eileen, this is perfect!

Sir Gablethorp: Indeed. I feel thoroughly transformed into a star of rock.

Mordecai: Well, almost perfect.

(Scene transitions to the living where Mordecai and Rigby sit Gablethorp down in front of the TV.)

Mordecai (continued): This'll help you to remember who you really are.

(Mordecai turns on the TV and an Adrenaline performance appears on the screen, surprising Gablethorp.)

Sir Gablethorp: Remarkable!

(He gets closer to the screen.)

Sir Gablethorp (continued): A tiny band of men you can hear and see? What sorcery is this?

(Rigby goes over to him.)

Rigby: No! No more of that knight talk, man. Just watch the screen.

(He makes Gablethorp look at the screen. Ace Balthazar is being interviewed.)

Interviewer: Describe yourself in one word.

Ace Balthazar: Acestounding.

Sir Gablethorp: Acestounding!

(As Gablethorp watches Ace performing and crashing, day and night his mind grasps everything about Ace's life. The scene flashes out to Adrenaline's place of residence. Ricky answers a knock on the door, and sees it's Mordecai and Rigby.)

Ricky: Oh, it's you blokes again. Get out!

(Mordecai and Rigby move aside and present the fully transformed Ace Balthazar.)

Sir Gablethorp (Ace): Aren't you gonna invite your old bandmate inside?

Ricky: Ace?

(The two other band members stand up in shock.)

Sir Gablethorp (Ace): I don't know about you guys, but I've got an Adrenaline rush, and I think I'm gonna...

John and Pierce: Crash! Crash!

John, Pierce and Ricky: Crash! Crash! Crash!

(As they chant, the Ace-turned Knight crashes everything in the room.)

Sir Gablethorp (Ace): Now are we gonna rock out or what?

(Everyone smiles. Scene cuts to the Adrenaline concert. Mordecai and Rigby are back stage.)

Mordecai: Dude, we did it! We're gonna see Adrenaline play live!

Mordecai and Rigby: Crash! Crash Crash!

(Ricky walks up to the mic.)

Ricky: I wanna thank all of you for being here. And I wanna tell you that tonight, rock history will be made! Because tonight, after years of silence, Adrenaline plays again!

(He steps back as Gablethorp rises up, taking the stage as Ace Balthazar. He smiles as the audience cheers.)

Fat Man: How I've longed for this moment!

(The Ace turned Knight steps up to the microphone.)

Sir Gablethorp (Ace): Alright, let's rock! 1,2,3,4-

(The mic suddenly crackles with electricity, and the stage lights dime down.)

Rigby: Ah, what?

Mordecai: Woah!

(A gust of wind blows and the speakers electrify. An audience member points to the sky as a green light forms. Mordecai, Rigby and the Knight shield their eyes as the green light is revealed to be the ghost of Ace. He screams.)

Ace Balthazar: Imposter! 

(He lands beside the Knight.)

Ace Balthazar: This isn't the real Ace Balthazar! I am!

Mordecai and Rigby: Uh oh!

Ace Balthazar: You! You are a disgrace!

Sir Gablethorp: But,.. but...

Ace Balthazar: (mockingly) "But..but.." but nothing! I'm the real deal here, and this band is nothing without me! No offense, you guys.

(The other members reply none taken.)

Ace Bathazar (continued): Now get off this stage, you poser!

(The crowd boos. Mordecai and Rigby run onstage.)

Rigby: Stop! Stop!

Mordecai: Wait, hold on! We're sorry we thought he was you. It's just, we really wanted to see Adrenaline play live. Please just let him play.

Ace Balthazar: No. Now get off the stage!

Crowd: Yeah! Get off the stage! Get off the stage! Get off the stage!

(The fat man throws his quesadilla at the Knight, followed by him getting pelted by other items.)

Sir Gablethorp: Enough! Enough, I say!

(The crowd stops.)

Sir Gablethorp (continued): For years, I have been fascinated by your culture. I have worked hard to embrace this as my own, yet this is how I am to be repaid?!

(Short silence. Gablethorp points at Balthazar.)

Sir Gablethorp (continued): Now hear this, Ace Balthazar. I've got an Adrenaline rush, (puts on helmet) and I think I'm gonna crash.

(His guitar tranforms into an axe, and he begins crashing the stage by shooting electrics lasers at the sound equioment. Mordecai, Rigby, Ace and the band move out of the way as Gablethorp set the stage on fire. The audience cheers at this.)

Ace Balthazar: His crashing....it's acestounding!

(Before Gablethorp can crash any further, Balthazar takes his axe and goes to him.)

Ace Balthazar (continued): I was wrong about you. Never before have I seen anyone crash that way. That was better than anything I could've ever done.

(Gablethorp smiles.)

Ace Balthazar (continued): Kneel, Sir Gablethorp.

(He does so and removes his helmet.)

Ace Balthazar (continued): I hereby dub thee the new Ace Balthazar!

(The audience cheers.)

Ace Balthazar (continued): Now, take the stage!

(Gablethorp steps up and plays lute music while using a rock gesture. Mordecai and Rigby are shocked. The audience boos and throw cans at him. Ace floats to him and takes the guitar.)

Ace Balthazar (continued): Forget it, I'll just do it. 1, 2, 3, 4!

(Adrenaline plays a rock song.)

Mordecai: Well, at least we finally get to see Adrenaline play live!

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

Sir Gablethorp: Ooh! This music is amazing! It must be shared!

(He shoots open a portal from his glove, which leads to his medieval world, and many knights come out and dance with the audience. The Eggscellent Knight from Eggscellent appears. He laughs in a jolly tone and runs into the audience, but is knocked down.)

Eggscellent Knight: I have moshed poorly.

(The other knights chant on Gablethorp as they crowd surf him.)

Mordecai: Dude, best concert ever.

(The episode ends as the concert continues.)

(End of Ace Balthazar Lives.)


()

Benson:

Rigby:

(The episode begins with Benson giving out appreciation plaques.)

Benson: The next person receiving an appreciation plaque is... Skips. (applauds) It says here in the Book of Park Records that you went the whole year without taking a day off.

Muscle Man: Oh, man, that's like, 400 days!

(Mordecai and Rigby look at Muscle Man in confusion)

Benson: Thanks, Skips, we appreciate it. The next is... Pops.

Pops: Hooray!

Benson: For helping a baby bird back into its nest.

Mordecai: Oh dude, we're next.

Rigby: That plaque is gonna look sweet hanging on over my bed.

Mordecai: Yeah. Finally some recognition. (high-fives)

Benson: And last, but not least, two guys who really pulled it together this year. Two guys that remind us to not just work hard, but to work hard at having a good time. Two guys that we couldn't do without. And these two guys are Mmmm... Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost.

Muscle Man: WOOOOOOOOOOOO! Yeah! Eat on that, Mordecai and Rigby!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five ghost go into the golf cart).

(Muscle Man drives in a circle).

Muscle Man: WOOOOOOOO! WOOOOO! WOOOOOOOO!

(Muscle Man drives away).

Mordecai: Come on Benson, what about us?

Benson: Oh, yeah. Mordecai and Rigby. Let's see, let's see. (closes book) Clean up this mess.

(Benson starts to walk away).

Mordecai: Wait, Benson. What about our appreciation plaques?

Benson: In order to get a plaque, you have to do something that's appreciated. And according to The Book of Park Records, all you guys do is mess up and slack off.

Mordecai: We do stuff for The Park all the time.

Rigby: Yeah, there has got to be something good about us in that book.

(Rigby reaches for the book but Benson pulls back).

Benson: This book is a record of everything that has ever happened in The Park. It's been handed down from manager to manager since The Park's founding. It's a sacred document, so keep your dirty hands off.

Mordecai: Can't you fund in a bit to make us look better?

Benson: No, I can only write the truth, and the truth is I don't appreciate you.

(Benson drives away).

Rigby: Awwwwwww, I can't believe this.

Mordecai: Relax, dude. We just need to do some work so he'll see what awesome employees we are. I bet if he sees us doing one job, he'll totally appreciate us.

Rigby: Yeah! We'll make him appreciate us so hard, we'll be the ones handing out the plaques. To.....ourselves.

(The scene then cuts to Mordecai and Rigby raking leaves. Mordecai points out Benson riding up to them on the golf cart. Mordecai and Rigby start to rake the leaves. When the golf cart comes up to them, it turns out it was Pops. Pops waves to them. Mordecai and Rigby then start to fight, and end up in the leaves beating each other up. Benson walks up to them and sees them beating each other up. Then he writes something about them in The Book of Park Records. The scene then cuts again to Mordecai and Rigby mowing the lawn. Rigby points out Benson. Mordecai then makes the lawn mower goes too fast, resulting in them almost running over Benson and both of them crash into a tree. Benson writes something about them in The Book of Park Records. The scene then cuts once again to Mordecai and Rigby painting the house. Rigby and Mordecai are painting when the ladder Rigby is standing on falls over and knocks into Mordecai. The paint bucket Mordecai was holding drops. The paint lands on the golf cart, and Benson once again, writes something about them in The Book of Park Records).

(We then cut Mordecai and Rigby cleaning the golf cart with sponges).

Mordecai: Aww, this is hopeless! Benson is never gonna appreciate us! Anyone who reads that book will think we're complete slackers.

Rigby: What if we change it? We can re-write it, so we look like the employees of the century!

Mordecai: Dude. Let's go change that book.

(Scene goes to Mordecai and Rigby sneaking into Benson's office).

Rigby: (Looks around the room) The coast is clear.

Mordecai: The Book of Park Records.

(The book suddenly moves in Mordecai's hand).

Rigby: Dude, open it up.

Mordecai: I don't know, man. Maybe we shouldn't do this. What if we aren't meant to see what's inside?

Rigby: Pfft. If we were not supposed to see what's inside, they shouldn't have taught us how to read. (Looks in the pages in the book).I found our names!

Mordecai: Give me that.

(Mordecai takes the book back from Rigby).

Rigby: Hey!

Mordecai: Mordecai and Rigby are lazy, GOOD-FOR-NOTHING SLACKERS? Awww!

Rigby: It's kind of true.

Mordecai: Their continued employment is one of life's greatest mysteries? Can't be taught, untrustworthy, useless, destruction of park property?

Rigby: Oh sure, that one time.

Mordecai: A GENERAL WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND SPACE?!

Rigby: Ugh! Anyone who reads that is gonna think we're complete tools. (Kicks the phone).

Mordecai: No, they're not. Let's change this stupid book. Mordecai and Rigby are my two favorite employees.

Rigby: Let me try. Every morning Mordecai and Rigby make blueberry pancakes, do the dishes, and wash the floor.

Mordecai: I save all my hardest jobs for them.

Rigby: They're always sweating from all the hard work they do.

Mordecai: Hahahaha! They're the most reliable guys I ever met.

Rigby: I trust them with my own life.

Mordecai: Wait, wait. I got one. Check it. There was this blizzard, and Skips broke his leg, but it didn't matter because Mordecai and Rigby took him to the hospital.

Rigby: Hahaha! They totally took him to the hospital!

Mordecai: Yeah, the emergency part of the hospital!

Rigby: Then they were suddenly attacked by Snowballs the Ice Monster. It was like 20 feet tall with-

(The duo hear footsteps coming toward them and see the doorknob start to move).

Mordecai: Dude, it's Benson. Dude, we gotta get out of here.

Rigby: Wait, I'm not done!

Mordecai: Rigby!

Benson: (Benson walks into the room, looking at his desk). There it is. (He walks to his desk and picks up The Book of Park Records) Huh? Hmmmmm... (Leaves the room).

Rigby: Awww, man, I didn't get to write the ending!

Mordecai: Whatever, dude. It's not like anyone is gonna believe that stuff. Just be glad we didn't get caught.

(The scene then cuts to the next day, where Mordecai and Rigby are in the kitchen).

Rigby: Are those pancakes? I smell pancakes.

Mordecai: Blueberry? Man, those smell good.

Rigby: Yeah. Who's making them?

Benson: What are you two slackers- (Sniffs the air) Wow, Rigby, those smell great.

Rigby: Yeah, but-

Benson: Are they ready yet? I'm starving.

Rigby: Ugh, sure.

Benson: (Eats a pancake) Rigby, these are incredible. Thanks. You made my morning. Oh, no. Oh, no you didn't. Did you guys do the dishes too?

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugh, yeah.

Benson: And you washed the floor?

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah!

Benson: Oh, man I appreciate that, you know I do.

(Benson, Mordecai, and Rigby all high five each other).

All 3: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!!!

Benson: I need reliable guys like you to do some hard jobs for me today. Are you in?

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah...

(Various scenes cut to Mordecai and Rigby doing a ton of hard jobs).

Rigby: Ugh! It's so hot. I can't stop sweating.

Mordecai: Dude, is it just me, or does being appreciated blow?

Rigby: Yeah man. It's not worth it.

(Pops drives by).

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, did you hear? There's to be a blizzard this afternoon!

Mordecai: But it's the middle of Summer.

Pops: I know, but look! (shows he has tennis rackets tied to his feet) I've already donned my snowshoes.

Rigby: Pfft, snow? Sounds like more crazy Pops talk to me, right?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Start laughing)

(A giant blizzard appears out of nowhere).

Mordecai: This is crazy!

Rigby: Dude, I think it's the book!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Don't you get it? The pancakes, Benson liking us, the work, this blizzard!

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!

(We then see Mordecai and Rigby driving the golf cart).

Mordecai: Dude, how are we gonna find him? I can't see anything!

Rigby: Just keep going! (The duo crash into something) What was that?

(Mordecai and Rigby get out of the cart and realize that they ran over Skips).

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!

(Mordecai and Rigby lift Skips up. His leg is broken because of the crash, making him scream)

Rigby: That's not good.

Mordecai: Help me get him into the cart!

(Mordecai and Rigby get Skips into the cart and drive away. They keep driving until the cart gets stuck in the snow.)

Rigby: Oh no! We're dead!

Mordecai: Wait here!

(Mordecai runs away).

Rigby: Mordecai! Come back!

(Mordecai uses a snow machine to clear all the snow. We then see a giant piece of ice starts to fall).

Rigby: Look out! (Mordecai notices the ice and runs away just in time. A giant ice monster resembling a spice worm from Dune appears out of a block of snow.) I don't remember writing that in the book.

Mordecai: You had to say Snowballs the Ice Monster?

Rigby: He doesn't look that bad.

Mordecai: Fire? You made him breathe fire? Are you kidding?

Rigby: It's looking at us! (The duo drive away.) This is all your fault!

Mordecai: You were the one who wanted to change the book.

Skips: You wrote lies in the Book of Park Records?

Mordecai: Maybe...

Rigby: Yeah, well... You're the one who made me stop writing. There's gonna be a super sweet ending with bazookas, and explosions, and a heli--

Mordecai: Rigby, the book. If everything we write in the book comes true, then all we need to do is... (gasp)

Mordecai and Rigby: We gotta find Benson.

(The duo meet Benson near Pops house.)

Benson: Hey, just the guys I wanted to see. Ive got your appreciation plaques.

Mordecai: (grabs the Book of Park Records from Benson) Not now. I'm gonna make everything go back to normal.

Rigby: Wait, you're not gonna change everything back, right? At least, leave some of the good stuff.

(Snowballs the Ice Monster grabs the book from Mordecai.)

Mordecai: The book! (Mordecai and Rigby chase after the Monster. The Monster rips the pages out of the book and tosses them away.) NOOO!

Rigby: (Snatches all the pages) Mordecai, hurry! Write something!

Mordecai: "...then the monster breathed fire on itself and he melted." (The Monster is still alive and it burns park visitors cars.) "...and then the monster disappeared forever."

(The Monster burns Pops house.)

Rigby: Why isn't it working?

Skips: (drives past them in the cart) Because he still has the cover!

(Skips drives towards the Monster as fast as he can. He steps on the gas and increases the speed even more that makes his cart fly. The cart crashes into the Monsters arm that makes the book cover fall to the ground. Rigby speeds towards the cover.)

Mordecai: Rigby! 

(While Rigby runs towards the cover of the book, Snowballs the Ice Monster notices him running to get the book cover and chases after him. Rigby speeds as fast as he can to get the cover, and jumps in the air, just when Snowballs was just about to bite him, and finally grabs the cover. Then, Rigby notices that Snowballs was running towards him, getting ready to swallow him.)

Rigby: Mordecai, catch!

(Rigby throws the cover to Mordecai and right after that Snowballs swallows him. Mordecai grabs the cover of the Book of Park Records, restores the book, and starts to write in it.)

Mordecai: "...and the monster went away and everything went back to normal."

(Snowballs the Ice Monster was about to eat Mordecai, but the melts down to ground, and then, the snow from Snowballs absorbs into a little snowball and completely blows up. And just like that, everything was all back to normal.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa.... Cool...

Benson: I'll take that. (snatches the book from Mordecai) I don't know what's been going on here, or why you two jokers have my book, so you had better clean this mess up starting now, or YOURE BOTH FIRED!

Mordecai: What mess?

(Benson looks around and sees no mess at all.)

Benson: Uh...

Rigby: We did all the jobs you asked us to do.

Benson: Skips, let's get out of here.

(Benson and Skips drive away in the cart.)

Rigby: What? Still no appreciation plaques?

(End of Appreciation Day)

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby walking to the fountain to clean it)

Rigby: Uggggggggggghh!

Mordecai: C'mon, Rigby, it will be over before you know it.

Rigby: Man, I hate cleaning the fountain! It's like the worst job at The Park! Why do we have to clean it anyways, isn't that what rain is for?!

Mordecai: I know, dude, but we just gotta power through it. Here, I'll turn off the water, you start the hose.

Rigby: What?! Why do I have to start the hose?!

Mordecai: It's your turn.

Rigby: My turn, your turn, what's the difference? We're a team, man.

Mordecai: Then man up and do it for the team.

Rigby: Rock, paper, scissors for who starts the hose.

Mordecai: Fine.

(They play rock, paper, scissors. Mordecai gets scissors and Rigby gets paper.)

Rigby: Two out of three?

Mordecai: Start the hose!

Rigby: (angrily mocking Mordecai) "Start the hose."

(Mordecai turns off the fountain and Rigby puts the hose inside the fountain. Rigby sighs, then puts his mouth on the hose and accidentally sucks in the water.)

Rigby: (spitting out the water) Blegh! It tastes like how Muscle Man smells!

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. But check out all this free stuff.

Rigby: All right, what's it gonna be this time?

(They find the baby ducks in the fountain among with some trash)

Rigby: A bunch of baby ducks?

Mordecai: We must have stranded them when we drained the water.

(Mordecai tries to catch them but they run away)

Mordecai: C'mon, dude, help me get them out! We can't clean the fountain with them still in it!

(Mordecai and Rigby try to catch them but they can't keep up with the ducks.)

(The Baby Ducks start chirping)

Mordecai: Get the bucket.

(Mordecai chases the ducks into a bucket. Rigby and Mordecai dump the ducks out of the bucket)

Mordecai: I wonder what they were doing in there all alone.

Rigby: Maybe their mom got scared off or something.

Mordecai: Ready to get back to work?

Rigby: I guess.

(Rigby tries to walk away, but the baby ducks keep following him).

Rigby: I think they're following me!

Mordecai: Haha, dude! They imprinted on you!

Rigby: What?!

Mordecai: Haha, they did! They totally think you're their mom!

Rigby: Stop it!

(Rigby tries to run away from the ducks while Mordecai is laughing at him).

Rigby: Quit following me! I'm not a duck!

Mordecai: Haha! What are you doing? Trying to teach them how to suck at football?

Rigby: Shut up!

(Rigby keeps trying to run away and spins around in circles from the ducks and bumps into Benson)

Benson: Are you two finished cleaning the fountain yet?

Rigby: We're working on it.

Benson: Oh really? Because it looks like you're just playing with a bunch of baby ducks!

Mordecai: We're not playing! We found them in the fountain!

Rigby: Now they won't stop following me.

Mordecai: They imprinted on Rigby.

Benson: Ha! They think Rigby is their mom? Haha! That's the saddest thing I ever heard!

Mordecai: No, I think someone naming their kid Rigby is the saddest thing I ever heard.

Rigby: Hey!

Mordecai: Pfft, just kidding. But seriously, we can't clean this fountain if we're babysitting these ducks.

Benson: Alright, fine. Find a place for those ducks and get back to work, and don't slack off. You still need to clean the park truck when you're done.

(Benson walks away)

Rigby: Aw, man! How do we get rid of these ducks?

Mordecai: Easy. Chicks.

(Scene changes to Mordecai and Rigby at the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: Uggggh! Where are they?!?

Mordecai: Relax! They'll be out in a minute.

(three of the baby ducks jump into Rigby's cereal bowl)

Rigby: Get out of my cereal!

Mordecai: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Rigby: Oh, thanks a lot. You're a real pal. (walks away from the table) Hm, hm, hm. Step off! Step off! You don't want none of this!

Margaret and Eileen: Awwww!

Eileen: Who are your little pals, Rigby?

Rigby: Little pals? More like little jerks! Look what they did to my cereal! (angrily points to cereal)

Eileen: Aw! They made a baby duck milk waterfall.

Rigby: Get away from me!

Margaret: Aw, look! Now they're copying you!

Rigby: Uggggh!

Margaret: What's the matter, don't you like them?

Eileen: (holding a duck) Is Rigby ignoring you because you're not a beautiful swan yet?

Mordecai: Err... Well we found them at the park and we're supposed to get rid of them. Actually, we were thinking maybe you guys could use some baby ducks!

Margaret: No pets allowed in my building.

Eileen: (suddenly covered in spots) And I'm allergic to duck dander.

Margaret: I bet the Animal Shelter could find them a good home!

(Scene goes to the Animal Shelter)

Animal Shelter Receptionist: Can I help you?

Mordecai: Err... We found these baby ducks and we-

Rigby: (interrupting) We wanna get rid of 'em. (Mordecai angrily punches Rigby) Uggh!

Mordecai: We want to find them a good home.

Animal Shelter Receptionist: Alright, I'm going to need you to fill out some paper work. You can start by... Are those ducks karate chopping each other?

(Ducks karate chopping each other)

Rigby: Er... No.

(Ducks beat up a dog and it crawls into a corner whimpering)

Animal Shelter Receptionist: I'm sorry, we can't take violent animals.

Mordecai: Aw, what? They're not violent!

Rigby: Yeah, man, they were just playing around!

Animal Shelter Receptionist: Those ducks are thugs.

Rigby: You know, some people would think karate chopping was really cool!

(The Ducks karate chop the leg off a table, smashing a tank from which a snake crawls out. They karate chop it into either death or unconsciousness. Later, Mordecai, Rigby and the ducks walk out of the Animal Shelter building)

Rigby: Now what are we gonna do?

Mordecai: I guess we're just gonna have to find someone cool to take them.

Rigby: That shouldn't be a problem. Check this out.

(Rigby punches the air above the Ducks)

Rigby: They're not even flinching!

Mordecai: That is pretty cool.

Rigby: Yea-yuh! And they're fast learners, too.

(The Ducks punch at each other)

Mordecai: Dude! These ducks are awesome!

Rigby: Yeah, man! We can't just give them to some loser!

Mordecai: Don't worry, we'll find somebody to take them. Video game break?

Rigby: Video game break!

(Scene goes to Mordecai, Rigby and the Ducks on the house sofa. On the game, two monsters are fighting. The one on the left wins without any real competition.)

Mordecai and the Ducks: OOOOOOOHHH!

Mordecai: Ha ha ha! Dude, this is crazy! That's the third time in a row that they beat you!

Rigby: It's not my fault! I told you this controller's busted.

Ducks: Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm!

Rigby: Uggh! Step off! Step off!

Mordecai: I don't know, man. I think there's something special about these ducks. Maybe we shouldn't give them away.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: I don't know. I mean, maybe we should keep them.

Benson: (coming into the room) What was that?

Mordecai: Huh? Oh, hey, Benson. We were just saying maybe we should keep... looking for someone to keep... these ducks!

Rigby: Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

Benson: Are you guys done cleaning the fountain?

Mordecai: Oh, well, no. Because we're still looking for people to take these ducks.

Benson: I don't care! Find someone to take care of these ducks right now and get back to work or you're fired!

(Benson angrily leaves the room)

Baby Ducks: OOOOOOHHH!!!

Mordecai: Not cool, guys.

(Scene changes to Mordecai, Rigby and the ducks in the kitchen sitting at the table. Mordecai finishes a flier for the baby ducks and shows Rigby)

Mordecai: Okay, how about this?

Rigby: Man, I dunno. Fliers? The only people who are gonna see these are some creepy old dudes in the park. We can't just give the ducks to some loser.

Mordecai: Come on, dude, we have to do what Benson said. Besides, someone cool will take the ducks, you'll see. It's the right thing to do.

Rigby: Alright, let's go put these things up.

(Scene changes to outside of the house. The baby ducks are swimming in a kiddy pool and Mordecai and Rigby are sitting on the stairs at the front. The duck collector arrives at the house in a green truck and Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector walk up to each other. The baby ducks are seen beating each other.)

Duck Collector: I like the looks of these babies. Here. (he opens up a cooler so the ducks will go in)

Mordecai and Rigby: No.

(The Duck Collector closes his cooler and the scene changes back to where Mordecai is sitting on the stairs, and Rigby is in the pool sitting on a pool ring with the baby ducks)

Mordecai: Let's face it. These ducks are too cool. We're not gonna be able to find someone who we can trust to take care of them.

Rigby: See, I told you.

Mordecai: I don't hear you come up with any great ideas (a jet of water is squirted at Mordecai). Hey, cut it out!

Rigby: Hahahahahaha! (keeps squirting water at Mordecai with his hand)

(The bunch of baby ducks are mimicking Rigby and squirting water at each other)

Rigby: Maybe we can keep the ducks if we just hide them from Benson.

Mordecai: There's no way! He'd find them anywhere.

Rigby: Not if we hide them in plain sight. They can stay in the bathtub and I'll train them to act like rubber duckies. Like this.

(Rigby makes a face of a rubber ducky and the baby ducks copy Rigby's face)

Mordecai: Dude, that could actually work.

Rigby: Okay, now squeeze me so I can train them to squeak.

Pops (standing at the porch): Mordecai and Rigby! Telephone call for you inside!

Mordecai (picks up the phone): Hello?

Mother Duck (voice): Um yeah hello, I'm calling about your ad. Are these ducks small and fluffy and yellow?

Mordecai: Yes.

Mother Duck: Ohhh, my babies! Thank goodness. I leave the fountain for one minute and next thing I know they're gone.

Mordecai (covering transmitter on the phone): It's their mom. She wants her babies back.

Rigby: Tell her "no". We got the rubber duck plan all worked out!

Mordecai: Come on, Rigby, think about it. We don't know anything about raising ducks.

Rigby: It can't be that hard.

Mordecai: You can't even feed yourself. How are you gonna feed a bunch of ducks?

Rigby (his stomach grumbles): Good point. I don't think I've fed them at all yet. Have you?

Mordecai (returns to the phone): When do you wanna pick them up?

Mother Duck: I'll be right over.

(Mordecai and Rigby are walking out of the house)

Rigby: Do you even know what they eat?

Mordecai: I feel like dog food might...

(The duck collector is seen loading the baby ducks into his cooler)

Mordecai: Hey!

Rigby: Stop!

Mordecai: We shouldn't have left them alone!

(The duck collector rushes off to his truck while Mordecai and Rigby chase after him but Mordecai slips and falls into the kiddy pool. The duck collector tosses the cooler into the back of the truck and the ducks are heard chirping inside. Mordecai and Rigby run up to the front of the truck)

Mordecai: (banging on the truck window): Hey! Open the door!

Rigby (climbing up the hood of the truck and banging on the windscreen): We want our baby ducks back!

Duck Collector: Oh, I think you mean my baby ducks. Sure was mighty kind of you boys to hand them over so nicely!

(The duck collector starts the ignition of the truck using a key with a duck chain on it. The windscreen wipers are activated and knocks Rigby of the truck and falls to the ground and Rigby grunts in pain)

Duck Collector: Ta ta! (waves and drives off)

(Mordecai walks and stops. Rigby runs up to Mordecai)

Mordecai: This isn't over. Uh-oh.

(Mother Duck is flying over to Mordecai and Rigby and lands in the kiddy pool. Mordecai and RIgby walk over to Mother Duck)

Mother Duck: Where are my babies?

Rigby: That guy just took 'em!

Mother Duck (jumps out of kiddy pool): What?

Mordecai (about to walk away): I'll get the cart!

Mother Duck: There's no time for carts! Hurry, get on!

Mordecai: Uhh, are you sure that's... I mean I dunno if...

Mother Duck: Get on!

(Mordecai is sitting himself on Mother Duck)

Rigby: Whoa whoa whoa! I'm not sittin' behind you.

Mordecai: Dude, just sit in the back.

Rigby: You sit in the back!

Mordecai: Let's play rock, paper, scissors for it.

(They play rock, paper, scissors. Mordecai gets rock and Rigby gets scissors)

Rigby: Aaagh!

(Rigby sits behind Mordecai and Mother Duck takes off)

Mother Duck: Where'd he go?

Rigby: Over there!

(The duck collector's truck is seen driving and Mother Duck dives down as Mordecai and Rigby are screaming. Mordecai jumps off Mother Duck onto the top of the truck and the Duck Collector hears from inside. The Duck Collector swerves as Rigby just lands on top of the truck, but is hanging from the edge. Rigby struggles, but Mordecai holds Rigby's hand and lifts Rigby up on top. Mordecai runs across to the open window and swings in where the Duck Collector is sitting and kicks the Duck Collector. Rigby jumps in and tries to push the Duck Collector away. Mordecai manages to punch the Duck Collector, causing the truck to rotate, but the Duck Collector pushes Mordecai and Rigby across the area of the driver's room.)

Rigby: Give me back my ducks!

(Rigby gets a hold of the Duck Collector's head and slams it on the driver's wheel several times and the Duck Collector punches Rigby. Mordecai comes up and punches the Duck Collector, causing his hat to fall off, and Mordecai and the Duck Collector push each other for the control of the driver's wheel. Rigby holds onto the wheel and spins it right, and the truck tumbles and Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector are screaming. The park's fountain is destroyed by the tumbling truck, and stops with its top on the ground and smoke emerging from the bottom of the truck. Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector fight, and Mordecai is kicked and crashes into a tree. The baby ducks watch Mordecai crashing and walk over to him. The Duck Collector gets up and Rigby rolls away. Mother Duck flies in to attack the Duck Collector and pecks him on the head, and Mother Duck is knocked unconscious. The baby ducks look worried and Rigby pulls his fists in front of him ready to fight)

Duck Collector: I'm taking those ducks.

(The Duck Collector draws a sword from his cane and threatens Rigby with it, and Rigby shuffles backwards whimpering in fear)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(Rigby backs away and the baby ducks' eyes shine red in fury and all transform into a giant with a duck's head. Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector look up to the duck giant in shock. The scenery has a slight tinge of orange)

Duck Giant: Step off!

(Duck Giant's hand engulfs in flames and karate chops the Duck Collector into half. A huge explosion occurs and the scenery is all clear again. The Duck Giant transforms back into the baby ducks all chirping casually and Mordecai and Rigby are still shocked. The baby ducks run over to Mordecai and Rigby and jump up and down)

Rigby: You guys are so cool!

(The scene changes with the destroyed park fountain and the truck in the background. The baby ducks are cradled in Rigby's arms and Mordecai and Mother Duck are standing)

Rigby: We're really gonna miss you guys!

Mordecai: Yeah, take it easy, guys!

Rigby: Remember what we taught you! High five?

(Rigby holds out his hand and the baby ducks fist bump it. Mother Duck and the baby ducks are walking away)

Mordecai: And keep practicing your video games if you ever want to make a living at it!

Baby Duck: Hey, Mordecai and Rigby, thanks.

(The rest of the baby ducks face Mordecai and Rigby. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other and smile. )

Baby Duck: For being the coolest losers we knowww!

Baby Ducks (waving): OOOOOHHH!!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooooooaahhhhhh!!

(Mother Duck walks away and takes flight while the baby ducks follow. Mordecai and Rigby are waving. They turn around behind themselves smiling and see Benson frowning. Mordecai and Rigby stop smiling and look a bit worried)

Mordecai: Woa-hoh, hey, Benson. Alright, so there's good news and bad news. The good news is that the ducks' mom came back and picked them up! The bad news is the fountain is destroyed. So we're probably gonna need another chore to do. Is there any other things that might need cleaning?

(Benson walks away still frowning)

Mordecai: Benson?

(A montage of the park lakeside with people sailing, chilling, etc., Mordecai, Rigby and Pops are sitting around a table with a sandwich and some ingredients.)

Mordecai, Rigby, and Pops: Hoagie Sandwich! Hoagie Sandwich!

Mordecai: Squeeze out the Mustard, do it real quick! (Puts on Mustard)

Rigby: A dab of Mayo, too much'd be sick! (Puts Mayonnaise on)

Pops: Healthy veggies'll make this valid! (Puts on lettuce and tomatoes)

Rigby: And don't forget the main ingredients so we don't confuse it with a salad!

Mordecai, Rigby, and Pops: (Putting meat on) Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat!

(Mordecai elbows in onto the table and holds it up as everybody in the gang laughs.)

(A group of four fully grown Canadian Geese show up on the bridge. The Geese start attacking the lakeside, starting by scaring a couple away, pushing a squirrel off the bridge, and even dropping a giant rock on a paddle boat with a couple in it, breaking it and sending the couple into the lake. Two of the geese chest pound each other.)

Pops: Those ruffians!! (Gets up and runs to the geese) Now see here, geese!! Your behavior is most uncouth! Now, I'm afraid- (Geese start pushing him around) Ahhhh!

(Pops runs away, sobbing.)

Rigby: Hey, quit it!

(The geese stare at the sandwich and Rigby realizes it.)

Rigby: PROTECT THE SANDWICH!

(The geese attack it and throw it in the trash can.)

Rigby: (Sobbing) WHYYY?

(The geese start punching the trash can, smashing it in the process, and rolls the trash can towards the three where it may have hit another trash can, sending some garbage flying in the air.)

(Cuts to the house, and into Benson's office.)

Mordecai: Benson, something's gotta be done about those geese. Pops is locked in his room crying!

Benson: Yeah, we've been getting complaints. They're highly territorial, war-like birds. (Lays back his feet on the desk) Luckily, I got a couple of guys who will be taking care of the problem.

Mordecai and Rigby: Dude, awesome!

Rigby: Who is it?

Benson: A couple of guys named Mordecai and Rigby.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Mordecai: Maybe you don't understand, Benson. These geese... they're terrifying.

Rigby: Terrifying!

Benson: I don't wanna hear it! Do it or you're fired!!

Rigby: Man, you always say that. You're all talk, Benson.

Benson: (seething in rage) URRRRGH!! (gets up in a rage) URAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

(Mordecai & Rigby scream, and Benson chases Mordecai & Rigby out.)

(Scene cuts to the lakeside)

Mordecai: All right, dude, you ready?

(Rigby nods with a blanket in his hand, and Mordecai takes out another blanket.)

Mordecai: Here goes nothing.

(Mordecai and Rigby wave their blankets at the geese, screaming.)

Rigby: It's working!

(The geese snatch their blankets away. Two of them turn them into whips and start to whip the duo. The scene changes to a bottle titled GET GONE GEESE with a hose attached to it.)

Mordecai: (To Rigby) Ready?

Rigby: (To Mordecai) Ready!

(Rigby stares at the geese, attempted to get the hose but the geese in front of him picks it up with its beak and sprays the geese repellent on Rigby.)

Mordecai: Hey quit it! (Gets sprayed at) Uh! Smells like rotten eggs!

(The other geese come along. One of them pushes Mordecai down, and the other geese start to attack Rigby.)

Rigby: Wait, Mordecai! (miserably) Whyyy?? Whyyyy??!

(Mordecai pulls Rigby away from the geese.)

(Scene cuts to Skip's House.)

Mordecai: We need your help, Skips.

Skips: Ew! Rotten Egg Smell! I've got just the thing. First, drive to the ocean...

Rigby: No, we need your help with these crazy geese!

Skips: .....Oh, no. You're on your own with those things.

Mordecai: Aw Man, well what are we supposed to do?

Skips: Well... Geese and ducks are natural enemies. You guys know any ducks?

Mordecai: Ducks? (He glances at Rigby. A thought crosses their minds.)

(The scene transitions to Mordecai and Rigby standing outside Skips' House. Mordecai is holding his phone, cycling through the list of contacts. Finally, he finds the connection to the Baby Ducks and dials it. The line on the other end answers. The Baby ducks are back at their place, rollerskating, reading comics, and playing video games.)

Baby Duck 1: Hello?

Mordecai: Hey. It's Mordecai.

Baby Duck 1: Mordecai! Yo, other baby ducks, Mordecai is calling!

Baby Duck 2: Mordeco! How's it hanging? What's the word, Mordo?

Baby Duck 3: Good to hear from you, dude.

Mordecai: Hey, guys. We got a problem with --

Baby Duck 4: What's up, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Uh, a problem with geese.

Baby Duck 1: Aw, man. Geese are the worst!

Baby Duck 4: Yeah, they make me sick.

Baby Duck 2: Those guys are awful! You didn't use geese repellent or blankets, did you?

Mordecai: Uh... no.

Baby Duck 3: Good. 'Cause that just makes them angrier.

Baby Duck 4: (laughs) Yeah, you'd have to be a complete chump to use those.

Baby Duck 1: You want us to come and deal with them, man?

Mordecai: No, that's okay. We can do it ourselves. Could you just tell us what we gotta do?

Baby Duck 2: You should use lasers!

Mordecai: Lasers?

Baby Duck 3: Yeah, man. Those losers hate la-sers.

Baby Ducks: (singsong) La-la-la-la-lasers! La-la-la-la-lasers! Shine 'em in their faces! And watch 'em run awaysers! Zoop! Zoop! Zoop! Zoop! Zoop! Zoop! Wooo! (chuckling)

Mordecai: Thahah. Yeah, thanks. Uh, later, guys. (He hangs up.)

Rigby: Why didn't you ask them for help?

Mordecai: Come on, they have better things to do.

Skips: (opens the door) You guys are still here?

(The scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby hiding in a bush and peering through it.)

Rigby: (whispering) I can't believe it! They've taken over the entire lake! 

(The Geese are standing their ground. The park is entirely covered in guano.)

Mordecai: (whispering) Looks like they've marked their territory.

Rigby: (whispering) Aw, sick!

Mordecai:  (whispering) Let's do this.

(The two get out laser pointers.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm, hmm, hmm!

(They both shine the lasers onto one of the geese. The goose looks at himself, and the other geese start looking at the lasers. Mordecai and Rigby scan them up into the air.)

Mordecai: And Now! Dude, it's working!

Mordecai and Rigby: Yea-yuh! 

(The duo slap a hi-five, but then Rigby looks up into the air and sees that there are only three geese flying away.)

Rigby: Hey, weren't there four gee-

(Rigby gets interrupted as the fourth goose pops its head into the bush, honking angrily.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aaaagh! 

(The geese suddenly throw Mordecai and Rigby out of the bush. The duo start shining the laser pointers on them, but find they are outnumbered as the geese start attacking them. The two are thrown onto the ground as they groan, then suddenly all of the geese throw a tree into their way.)

Mordecai: I thought lasers were supposed to work! 

(Suddenly, a giant green laser fires at the tree and all of the geese fall off it. Then suddenly it cuts to the baby ducks, who are seen to have just saved their lives.)

Baby Duck: Lasers do work! You just gotta use the right kind!

Mordecai and Rigby: Baby Ducks!

Baby Duck: We thought you losers would get in trouble! Geese! This lake isn't yours! Leave now!

(The Geese's eyes start to glow red and one of them begins to talk)

Goose: (In a very deep voice) No! We are in the process of terraforming this lake for our own kind! (Mordecai and Rigby are seen looking in shock) We have removed all non-goose lifeforms and fertilized the soil! This lake is ours, duck! If you want it, you'll have to come and take it!

Baby Duck: That can be arranged! 

(The Geese begin to glow in red)

Baby Duck: (To Mordecai and Rigby) Get down!

(Mordecai and Rigby duck behind a bush as the Geese begin posing many times and they fly up to form a giant four-head, goose robot. The Baby Ducks begin fist pumping and they form together the Duck Man. The two giants prepare to fight.)

Goose Monster: Scrabble Missiles! (Fires six missiles at Mordecai, Rigby, and Duck Man)

Rigby: We're gonna die!

(The Duck Man blocks the missiles and flies toward the Goose Monster but gets shocked)

Duck Man: AHHH!!! Step off! (Chops the metal shocker off but gets blasted backwards by the Goose Monster. Mordecai and Rigby are seen coughing from the dirt and the Duck Man fires a blast at the Goose Monster but it has no effect. The Goose Monster begins laughing but Duck Man charges at the Goose Monster only to charge directly into a large energy sphere which sends them backwards.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Running to the Duck Man) NOO!!!

Goose Monster: (Grabs a tree that is near the house and knocks away the top part of it. Then throws the tree into the sky) Scrabble Missiles! (Uses missiles to destroy the tree then blasts the house more.)

Mordecai: Hey!

Rigby: That's our room!

Goose Monster: Now we will destroy everything you care about! (Grabs a television set) Starting with this standard-definition T.V.! Which is really doing you a favor! (Throws the tv into the sky) Scrabble Missiles! (The tv is destroyed by the missles.)

Mordecai and Rigby: NOOO!!!!

(Duck Man groans)

Mordecai: Is there any way we can help!?

Duck Man: It's...too dangerous.

Mordecai: We're not going to let you die!

Rigby: Yeah! Just tell us what to do!

Duck Man: Very well. Did you see what started our transformation?

Rigby: Uh...fist pumping?

Duck Man: Yes...You must fist pump!

Mordecai: Like this? (He and Rigby hold up their fists.)

Duck Man: No. Really fist pump! Fist pump with everything you got! (Mordecai and Rigby being fist pumping with both arms.) Maybe dial it back a bit...

(Mordecai and Rigby fist pump once more which sends a ray of light into the sky. Their video game console along with the gaming fist, shoes, and shorts are also brought out from their room. As "The Touch" by Stan Bush is playing, the items begin to merge with the Duck Man. Mordecai and Rigby are also equipped with items.)

Mordecai: Alright!

Rigby: Let's cook this goose! (Mordecai and Rigby position themselves inside the armor of Duck Man.)

Duck Man: Dudes! Can you hear me?

Mordecai: Yeah!

Rigby: Loud and clear!

(The Goose Monster fires a blast.)

Duck Man: Sonic Shield! (Mordecai and Rigby help bring up the Sonic Shield which blocks the blast.) Rocket fist!

Rigby: (Presses a button.) Bam! (The fist connects with the Goose Monster sending it backwards.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yes!

(The Goose Monster gets up and begins charging at them.)

Mordecai: Divert power to shoes!

(Duck Man jumps out of the way and begins beating down the Goose Monster. He punches a hole through the Goose Monster and fires musical notes at it. Then Duck Man flies up high.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Draw Power Sword! 

(Duck Man takes out a large sword and being to charge at the Goose Monster)

Computer: Altitude decreasing. (Two controllers appear.) Manual Sword Control.

(Duck Man charges toward the Goose Monster as Mordecai and Rigby are controlling the movement and being to spin the sword in circles which cuts the Goose Monster apart. The Goose Monster turns back into the four Geese and they are zapped and beaten down.)

Duck Man: Yeauya!

Mordecai: Game over, Geese!

Goose: Fools! The game of duck, duck, goose will never end! There will be future lakes! Future sandwiches to ruin....

Mordecai: Hey Geese!

(Duck Man's arm begins to glow.)

Mordecai, Rigby, and Duck Man: STEP OFF!!! (Duck Man's arm slams down on the geese completely destroying them.) WOOAHHHH!!!! (Duck Man turns back into the four Baby Ducks.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai: Thanks dudes! We couldn't have done it without you.

Baby Duck: Anytime!

Benson: MORDECAI AND RIGBY!

Mordecai: (Scared.) Hey...Benson.

Rigby: We got rid of the Geese!

Benson: Yeah! And HALF the park along with 'em! And you four! Look at the damage you caused!

Mother Duck: (Flies in.) Stop this right now! Mordecai and Rigby saved the Park! Quite possibly the world! You should be thanking them! And how dare you scold my children!? A grown man, yelling at Baby Ducks...You should be ashamed of yourself.

Benson: (Depressed.) I...I'm sorry ma'am...(Walks off.)

All: ALRIGHT! YEAH!

(The episode ends as the next few scenes show Mordecai and Rigby with the Baby Ducks, the Duck Man and Mordecai and Rigby flying though space on a guitar, and the three of them enjoying the sunset.)

(The episode begins with a flash of lightning. Pops is seeing zooming through the air, away from Anti-Pops, who is in his titan form. He slams his fist down, destroying parts of the Park, but gets distracted by a yellow light flying around him. Pops squints towards the light and notices that it's a dragonfly. He flies up towards it, then catches it. He opens his hand and discovers that the dragonfly is in fact a 2B pencil. He looks at the pencil anxiously, before Anti-Pops' titan hand grabs him. Pops is just dreaming on the sofa, and awakens)

Pops: Agh!

(Mordecai and Rigby run into the living room after hearing him scream)

Mordecai: Pops! Are you okay?

Pops: Yes, just a peculiar dream is all.

Rigby: Oh yeah! I've been having weird dreams too, Pops. Like this one where Eileen shows up and she's wearing -

(Rigby looks up to Mordecai, who is giving him a visual sign to stop talking)

Rigby: - It's not important! Everybody has weird dreams!

Pops: I suppose.

Mordecai: Well, we've got something that will cheer you up. Come have a look!

(The trio enter the control room, where Benson, Skips, Eileen, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are all together, staring at what's outside)

Pops: (gasps)

(Lolliland, Pops' home planet is right in front of him)

Pops: It's you, old friend! All these years watching you through my telescope, and I had no idea you were my home!

Rigby: No wonder it's your favorite planet.

Pops: So beautiful up close. Isn't she marvellous?

Skips: Under normal circumstances, I'd agree.

Eileen: Yeah, don't forget what we're here for. We have to battle Anti-Pops, whose whole thing is like - erasing the universe as we know it! No big deal!

Benson: All the more reason to be ready. Let's get down there.

(The Park Dome lands on Lolliland. The gang leave the Park and see the ruins of the planet)

Muscle Man: This is where Pops came from?

Pops: I can't believe it.

Hi Five Ghost: I thought it'd be a little cleaner.

(The gang notices silhouettes appearing beyond the ruins, groaning. The gang groans in anxiety. The silhouettes are revealed to be a mushroom man and two lollipop people, one with a striking resemblance to Pops)

Frivola-Kranus: Jolly Good Show! They're here!

Mordecai: Yeah, this is definitely Pops' planet.

Pops: Oh my! They're all so welcoming! (laughs)

Frivola-Kranus: You're here! You're finally here!

Quadravi-Kranus: We've been waiting eons for this moment! 

Frivola-Kranus: Allow us to introduce ourselves! I'm Frivola-Kranus!

Quadravi-Kranus: I'm Quadravi-Kranus!

Weird Mushroom Guy: And I'm Weird Mushroom Guy!

Pops: Well, it's a pleasure to meet all of you!

Benson: Hate to invade the moment, but don't we have a battle to prepare for, or something?

Frivola-Kranus, Quadravi-Kranus & Weird Mushroom Guy: Oh, very true! Come along!

(They all walk to the coliseum)

Muscle Man: Uh, no offence bros, but why's your planet all busted?

Frivola-Kranus: This is evidence of many battles past! No fight of such a grand scale is free of collateral damage! But the guardian can tell you all about that.

(The gang approach a giant stone foot wearing sandals)

Rigby: Uhh...

Guardian: My eyes are up here!

(The whole gang look up, to see that the Guardian of Lolliland is standing there)

Guardian: I am the Guardian of Lolliland. I exist to witness the titans' battle every 14 billion years!

Pops: Excuse me! Ma'am! Might you know how I can defeat Anti-Pops?

Guardian: I do not. I have never seen the battle end in victory. Only mutually assured destruction followed by a reset of the universe. Only this planet survives to record the outcome of each encounter. Chosen one, if you wish to know more, study the ancient tapestries.

Skips: Do we even have time for that? Isn't Anti-Pops supposed to be here soon?

Guardian: There is no sign yet of the one you call "Anti-Pops". Which is odd, he's usually on time.

(The scene cuts to Anti-Pops in his ship, looking at a radar of Pops at Lolliland)

Anti-Pops: He's already at Lolliland!?

(Out of anger, Anti-Pops turns around and erases his chair out of existence, he goes to confront one of his pilots)

Anti-Pops: You! Why aren't we moving?

Pilot: Uh, well you erased half the engine, so...we're sorta stalled out, sir.

Anti-Pops: Then I'll take one of the smaller ships!

(Cut to Anti-Pops in a small ship)

Ship A.I.: Coordinates set. Destination: Lolliland.

Anti-Pops: Warp speed at ten!

(The mini-ship exists the main ship, but a space deer is seen in his way)

Anti-Pops: Huh?

(The ship crashes into the space deer, who begins to start kicking Anti-Pops constantly, then flies away)

Anti-Pops: Agh! This is why I want to end the stupid universe!

Leader Bounty Hunter: Over a space deer?

Droid Bounty Hunter: I hit a space deer once, they're way stronger than you'd think.

Anti-Pops: Quiet!

(Anti-Pops erases the Droid's chips)

Droid Bounty Hunter: No! My chips.

Anti-Pops: I need to find another way.

(Transition to the Park gang checking out the ancient tapestries)

Frivola-Kranus: Welcome to the Hall of Tapestries! Anything you want to know about the previous battles exists in these creations!

Quadravi-Kranus: They weave a very detailed history!

(The Lolliland residents laugh)

Weird Mushroom Guy: He says that one every time!

Frivola-Kranus: Still funny!

Pops: It is funny!

(Frivola-Kranus shows the gang the first tapestry)

Frivola-Kranus: Here, you can see how you came into existence! Different versions of us were born over billions of years, never quite right! Until you! Mega-Kranus!

Pops: That's my name?

Mordecai & Rigby: (laughs) Mega-Kranus.

Frivola-Kranus: Yes! You are the ultimate creation! However, when you were created, the universe had to balance itself. Hence, Malum-Kranus was born!

Rigby: Oh! Malum-Kranus!

(Rigby whispers to Eileen)

Rigby: Malum means bad, right? 

Frivola-Kranus: Here, you'll see tapestries that show every clash over the millennia.

Hi Five Ghost: Kinda looks like they were fighting with pole noodles in this one.

Frivola-Kranus: Oh yes, that was a fun one.

Eileen: Wait guys, look!

(Eileen points to a tapestry which shows the other Park members holding weapons while in armor)

Muscle Man: Does that kinda look like us?

Weird Mushroom Guy: Yes. Everything that's happening now has happened before.

Mordecai: Everything?

Weird Mushroom Guy: Everything.

(He points to a tapestry showing Mordecai asking the same question)

Weird Mushroom Guy: Each battle ends in a draw, with two fists colliding, resetting the universe and ending in rebirth.

Muscle Man: Uh, hate to be a downer, but this sounds kinda...

Hi Five Ghost: Futile?

Benson: I mean, this has been happening for billions and billions of years. How are we gonna buck the odds?

(Mordecai walks over to get a closer look at the tapestries)

Skips: This doesn't look good...

(Mordecai notices a pattern between all of the tapestries)

Mordecai: (gasps)

Rigby: Dude, you got an idea?

Mordecai: Yes.

(Cut to inside the coliseum)

Mordecai: Okay, every battle starts in this coliseum, with Pops on this side, and Anti-Pops on that side. We know where he's gonna be! We can catch him off guard with some traps. If we wanna win, the only choice we have is to change things up!

Benson: That's not a terrible idea.

Muscle Man: This is like pranking the most evil guy ever! Consider the Master Prankster in!

Pops: Oh, a sneak attack? That doesn't seem very sporting.

Eileen: It's true this plan doesn't seem fair, but I think it's our best bet!

Pops: You too, Eileen?

Eileen: I know how it sounds, but everyone and everything we know and love is on the line here!

Mordecai: It's up to you, Pops. If you wanna keep doing this the way it's always been done, that's your choice. You're the chosen one.

(Pops takes a moment to silently think about his decision)

Pops: Okay, let's do it.

Rigby: Traps! Traps! Traps! Traps!

Hi Five Ghost: He already said we'd do it.

(A montage begins. Muscle Man unveils a plan he has composed for trapping Anti-Pops. Mordecai and Rigby both dig soil parallel to each other. Skips sharpens wood to make spikes. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost both pull a rope to set up a catapult, in which Pops uses his telekinesis to lift rocks into. Pops also forms a rocket out of thin air, as HFG creates flaming arrows. Pops rebuilds a crashed train which was beyond the ruins. Benson ticks everything off, as Pops hides the traps with rocks. Everybody celebrates, as we cut to Anti-Pops checking his phone for his taxi driver, Gilfoyle, to arrive. The driver arrives and beeps his horn) 

Gilfoyle: 'Sup, you Malum-Kranus?

Anti-Pops: Took you long enough.

(The Bounty Hunters enter the vehicle, leaving no space for Anti-Pops)

Anti-Pops: What is this? There's not enough room!

Gilfoyle: Always room in the front! Come sit up here with me, bro!

Anti-Pops: I'm not doing that. Gruff! You sit upfront.

Gruff: Aw man, I don't wanna.

Anti-Pops: (roars)

Gruff: Uh, yes sir!

(Gruff sits in the front, as Anti-Pops sits in the back)

Anti-Pops: Floor it!

Gilfoyle: I hate to tell you, traffic's backed up all up and down the 405 galaxy! Oh hey, do you want waters or snacks? They're in the side door back there!

Anti-Pops: I don't wanna hear it, just go!

(The Droid Bounty Hunter picks up a bag of chips from the side door)

Gilfoyle: Hey, how's the music? The volume okay?

Anti-Pops: Silence!

Gilfoyle: (laughs) I don't really like this music either.

(He turns the music off)

Gilfoyle: Yeah, I've been doing this for about six years, but this isn't like my main gig. DJing's what gets me out of bed! Oh, hey. If you ever need someone to spend an apartment with-

Anti-Pops: Aagh!!

(Cut to the coliseum)

Guardian: Anti-Pops draws near.

(Anti-Pops arrives at the coliseum, the lights turn off and spotlights shine towards Anti-Pops' corner)

Anti-Pops: And in this corner of the ring, the ferocious fighter! The erratic eraser! You love him! You love to hate him! Malum-Kranus!

(The lights switch on as Anti-Pops and his army walk up to the Park gang, stepping right in behind their tripwire)

Anti-Pops: Pops, I'm surprised you're still standing after our last showdown! But don't worry, I'll make sure that doesn't happen this time.

Pops: It doesn't have to end this way! Please, can't we settle this peacefully?

Anti-Pops: Peacefully? (laughs) Peace doesn't interest me! I won't be satisfied until the universe has come to an end by my hand! Now, let's get on with it.

Guardian: It is time. The titans have gathered in the coliseum, and now as is tradition, the ancient Lolliland anthem will be performed.

(The Lolliland residents clap, as a young lollipop boy, Eggum Kranus, walks into the coliseum)

Guardian: This year, sung by local boy, Eggum-Kranus!

Eggum-Kranus: (clears throat) Oh Lolliland, Oh Lolliland, our ball of beautiful dust. Her people strong, tall nine miles long with hearts that you can trust. Despite the titan battles, she stands through thick and thin. Oh Lolliland, Oh Lolliland, may good or evil win.

(Anti-Pops gets into a fighting stance, but the song's not over)

Eggum-Kranus: Oh Lolliland! Come on and take me to the promised land!

Anti-Pops: Enough! This battle starts now!

(Anti-Pops trips over the tripwire, activating the traps)

Anti-Pops: Oh no.

(Two spiked plates come out of the ground and crush Anti-Pops)

Benson: Now!

(Hi Five Ghost sets the flaming arrows on fire, and fires them towards the conjoined spike plates. Mordecai and Rigby unveil the catapult, which Skips activates by cutting some rope. The rocks surround the burning conjoined spike plates. Muscle Man presses a button, signalling a missile to come along and blow up the rock-surrounded burning conjoined spike plates. Eileen then presses a button which causes the Park Dome to fly into the air and shoot lasers towards the wreckage. Pops uses his telekinesis to throw a train on top too. Everyone stares)

Mordecai: I think...we did it!

Rigby: Wait.

(Rigby pats himself, then the ground)

Rigby: Universe is still here!

(Everybody cheers)

Muscle Man: Put that in the tapestry, son!

Weaver: Right away, sir!

Everyone: OOHHH!!

(They all hear Anti-Pops giggle offscreen, and look into his direction. He floats from behind the wreckage)

Anti-Pops: (laughs) That tickled.

Everyone: (screams)

Anti-Pops: (laughs)

Mordecai: Dude, I can't believe he's alive!

Rigby: Yeah, no one could survive that!

Mordecai: Huh, do you ever think about how many people we've seen probably die?

Rigby: Yeah, I'm sure they're all fine.

(Pops walks up to Anti-Pops)

Pops: Oh. Surely there's still time to settle this like gentlemen.

Anti-Pops: Ha! Tell you what, Pops. I'll make you a gentlemanly deal. You and I fight one on one, just you and me. If you knock me down, the universe is safe. You go home, and everything is...regular again. But if I knock you down...I destroy the universe! How's that for gentlemanly?

Pops: Very well. I accept your terms.

Anti-Pops: (laughs)

(The Park crew are nervous and walk off including Anti-Pops' army. Pops takes off his shirt and we see his six-pack. Anti-Pops takes his shirt off, revealing a twenty-four-pack. Muscle Man counts his abs.)

Eileen: Ew, that's not for me.

Muscle Man: 10, 11, 12...That's a twenty-four-pack, bro!

(Pops and Anti-Pops both get into a fighting stance. They stare at each other for some time, before Anti-Pops growls, leading to him to making the first punch. He hits Pops multiple times, causing Pops to become slightly unstable)

Mordecai & Rigby: Pops!

Skips: No! This is his fight!

(Pops and Anti-Pops fight each other)

Anti-Pops: Your technique is impressive, but you won't win this time!

(Anti-Pops fires telekinesis beams out of his hand towards Pops, who quickly jumps, causing it to take some rubble from a wall, he throws the rubble towards Pops, who quickly builds a brick wall to shield him. The rubble shatters into pieces. Anti-Pops throws the train which was used against him towards Pops, causing Pops to form a train track, for the train to go up and deflect towards Anti-Pops. Anti-Pops erases the train, and fires more beams towards Pops, breaking his brick wall, but Pops dodges each of them while floating in mid-air. Anti-Pops decides to float as well, and starts attacking Pops. He grabs Pops by the leg and throws him across the coliseum. He picks up a piece of Pops' broken wall and throws it towards him. Pops turns the wall into a flutter of butterflies, which Anti-Pops turns into a spiked wrecking ball, which zooms towards Pops, who dodges it, and turns it into a large steamboat, which collapses onto Anti-Pops, knocking him to the ground)

Anti-Pops: Ugh. (he is slightly injured)

Mordecai: Pops knocked him over! The universe is safe!

(Everybody celebrates, as Pops goes to make a truce with his brother)

Pops: It was an arduous battle, and though we had our-

Anti-Pops: Fire!

(The Bounty Hunters fire towards the Park crew, as Anti-Pops erases the steamboat and kicks Pops to the ground)

Everyone: Pops!

(The Park Crew hide behind a rock)

Pops: But I knocked you over! We made a gentlemanly deal!

Anti-Pops: A deal is only as good as the man who makes it!

(Everybody hears a noise coming from outside the coliseum, as well as a yellow light)

Anti-Pops: Huh?

(Streaming lands outside the coliseum)

Streaming: You thought you could get away from me, Discmasters, but everyone streams eventually!

Benson: Oh great, streaming's here now?

(Streaming and his army enter the coliseum)

Anti-Pops: Oh good, some extra help! The more, the merrier.

(Anti-Pops goes to kick Pops, but he dodges and jumps up to punch Anti-Pops, they continue their fight, as Streaming looks over the Discmasters)

Mordecai: Dude, let's go!

(Mordecai and Rigby run off)

Benson: Hey! Where are you going?!

Mordecai & Rigby: Trust us!

Benson: (annoyed) Ugh.

(Skips passes Benson a laser gun, and they both start firing while taking cover behind a rock, shooting the Droid Bounty Hunter's gun out of its hand. The Reptilian Bounty Hunter nearly hits Muscle Man, causing him to look up to the Guardian of Lolliland)

Muscle Man: Hey lady! You gonna help us down here or what?

Guardian: Well, I am supposed to remain neutral, but - aw heck, come on up here!

(The Guardian carries Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost onto her shoulder)

Muscle Man: Alright!

(The Guardian kicks down a side of the coliseum, kicking the rocks onto Streaming's army. She goes to wrestle Streaming. One of his minions jumps onto Benson and tries to destroy him, but Eileen kicks it off him and rapidly fires lasers into it, while screaming furiously. Mordecai and Rigby appear in their spaceships)

Mordecai: Let's bust a cap on this data!

Rigby: Aw Yeayuh!

(They both fire giant lasers from their ships towards Streaming)

Streaming: Minions! Merge with me, and let us stream like we've never strummed before!

(All of the minions merge into Streaming, making him much more powerful. He roars)

Mordecai: Streaming went from buffering to buff!

Benson: We're gonna need some more help.

(They hear HD-DVD offscreen)

HD-DVD: Mind if we join in on the fun?

(HD-DVD and Blu-ray fly into the coliseum)

Mordecai: HD-DVD and Blu-ray?!

Anti-Pops: What?! This wasn't in the tapestry!

Blu-ray: Well consider this the extended edition!

HD-DVD: And you're about to get a load of exclusive HD content!

(The Baby Ducks fly into the scene)

Rigby: Baby ducks!

Baby Duck: What's up, dudes?

(Behind them, is Chance Sureshot, Toothpick Sally, and Recap Robot in their ship)

Recap: Greetings, dudes!

Sureshot: Told you we'd meet up with you!

Rigby: Sureshot?

Mordecai: We thought you died!

Sureshot: Not before I cloned myself! I got a whole bunch of backup clones! Sure-enough-shot, Sure-whatever-shot, Close-enough-shot!

Sally: As long as none of them are poor shots!

Sureshot: Not this clone!

(Sureshot fires a laser towards Anti-Pops' army, nearly hitting Gruff)

Gruff: How many reinforcements do these guys have?

(Gary and the Guardians of Eternal Youth show up in Gary's car, followed by Carter and Briggs in their police cruiser, and Death on his bike)

Droid Bounty Hunter: Oh no!

Death: You blokes weren't gonna end the universe without me, were you?

Reginald: We'll give Anti-Pops something to really cry about!

Carter and Briggs: Aw y-y-y-y-yeah!

(Party Horse 42699 shows up in his pod)

Party Horse: End of the universe party, whoop!

(The baby ducks fly to the ground)

Baby Duck: Baby ducks assemble!

(The baby ducks morph into Hyperduck, this time forming an alliance with Benson, Eileen, Skips, the Giant Babies, Gary, Carter and Briggs, Death, and Party Horse. Everybody observes the transformation, which adds the Fists of Justice, Death's bike wheel and engine, Carter and Briggs' police cruiser, Gary's synthesizer and Party Horse's 3003 glasses)

Reptilian Bounty Hunter: (in their own language) Should we take them out while their still transforming?

Gruff: Nah, I wanna see what their final form looks like.

(Hyperduck's final form is revealed, transmitting Skips and Eileen above the 3003 glasses and Benson's head on top of the cap)

Benson: Oh, come on!

(Everybody else is transmitted to an unknown location inside of Hyperduck. One of the Giant Babies is late)

Oswald: Excuse me! Sorry!

(Hyperduck lands on the ground)

Gruff: Agh! Back to the ship!

(The Bounty Hunters run off, as Streaming faces Hyperduck, and Skips & Eileen T-pose)

Eileen: Everybody! Follow our lead!

(Streaming charges towards Hyperduck)

Skips: All you, Death!

Death: Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

(Death summons a giant discoball scythe, but Streaming attacks Hyperduck)

Death: Death ain't dying today!

(Death forces Streaming to the ground, then cuts him. Everyone cheers, but Streaming quickly teleports behind Hyperduck. Carter and Briggs prepare to attack)

Carter and Briggs: Resistance!

(They punch Streaming, who teleports again)

Eileen: Break it down, Party Horse!

Party Horse: Whoo! Get ready for some killer moves!

(Party Horse starts breakdancing to attack Streaming, he then jumps upside down and spins, which crushes Benson's head into the ground while spinning)

Benson: I hate breakdancing!

(Meanwhile, Pops gets knocked down by Anti-Pops, and nearly rolls off the edge of the coliseum, but manages to stay upright. The Bounty Hunters are firing lasers from their cab towards Rigby, who attempts to dodge them while screaming, while the Bounty Hunters laugh)

Gilfoyle: Uh, I still get a five-star rating for doing this, right?

Gruff: No way out this time, dweeb!

(Gruff fires a laser, and it hits Rigby)

Rigby: I'm hit!

(Rigby is ejected from his ship, and falls down to the ground, screaming, but is luckily caught by Mordecai in his ship)

Mordecai: Hmph, hmph. Nice of you to drop in, dude!

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOHHHH!!!

Gruff: No way!

(Sureshot fires a laser into the Bounty Hunters' cab)

Sureshot: Yahoo!

(The cab crashes into the Guardian of Lolliland's arm, causing an explosion, killing the Bounty Hunters and Gilfoyle)

Guardian: Ow.

(Meanwhile, Streaming wraps his wires around Hyperduck's wrists)

Streaming: (laughs)

(Everybody inside Hyperduck screams)

Skips: Gary! You know what to do!

(Gary uses his Synthos Powers to power up his synthesizer and fire a massive soundwave beam towards Streaming. Everyone celebrates. Streaming is in a critical condition)

Blu-ray: Let's delete this scene!

HD-DVD and Blu-ray: 5.1 Surround Shockwave!

(The siblings fire a shockwave towards Streaming, blasting him across the coliseum, the Guardian of Lolliland slams her elbow onto him)

Guardian: Elbow drop!

(Muscle Man swings his shirt around)

Muscle Man: Whoo!

Hi Five Ghost: Haha, yeah!

(The Lollipop Residents observe)

Frivola-Kranus: Good battle! Jolly good battle!

(Meanwhile, Pops knocks Anti-Pops off of the coliseum, Pops looks over the edge to see if he's gone)

Pops: Huh?

(Suddenly, Anti-Pops' titan form emerges from the outside of the coliseum. He is massive in comparison to everybody else. He fires his Erasing Beam onto Lolliland, which is now much more powerful)

Anti-Pops: (laughs)

(Anti-Pops erases Weird Mushroom Guy, Quadravi-Kranus and Frivola-Kranus from existence, followed by the Guardian of Lolliland. Muscle Man jumps off her shoulder with Hi Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: (squeals)

Anti-Pops: (laughs)

(The Erasing Beam is seen getting closer to Muscle Man. The episode briefly goes into slow motion, showing that with his weight, he can't keep running for much longer. The beam reaches Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, starting to erase them. Pops panics and fires his Protection Beam towards them. They both scream, as Anti-Pops' beam is more powerful)

Anti-Pops: (laughs) Any last words, Mitch? 

Muscle Man: (last words, before his death) You know who else grows really big to show their dominance, but is actually really small deep down? My...mom...

Hi Five Ghost: (laughs and coughs) Good one...(they high-five)

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost get erased from existence, everybody gasps in horror and disbelief. Pops tries to hold in his emotions, but is visibly unable to do so)

Pops: (grunts) NOOO!!!!

(Pops teleports outside of the coliseum, and emerges as his Titan variant. He faces Anti-Pops)

Anti-Pops: Give up, Pops. All your friends are going to die, and there's nothing you can do about it.

Pops: We can still resolve this, brother.

Anti-Pops: (growls) Stop calling me that!

(Anti-Pops fires his Erasing Beam towards Lolliland, and Pops fires his Protection Beam to try and save his friends, but Anti-Pops ends up erasing Chance Sureshot, Toothpick Sally and Recap Robot, who all scream)

Pops: No!

(The Erasing Beam reaches Hyperduck, erasing the Guardians of Eternal Youth, Gary, Death, Carter and Briggs, and Party Horse)

Party Horse: Agh, not cool!

(The baby ducks get erased from existence. Out of nowhere, Andy, the baby ducks' older brother appears in his spaceship)

Andy: Hey guys, sorry I'm late, just came from this hot par-

(Andy gets erased from existence. The Erasing Beam reaches Skips and Eileen, who both scream, before getting erased from existence, and then Benson, erasing all the components of Hyperduck. Mordecai and Rigby are both flying away from Lolliland, but mourning all of the losses they've just suffered)

Mordecai & Rigby: No!!!

(Pops is still attempting to save Lolliland, but Anti-Pops stops his Erasing Beam and floats up to him)

Anti-Pops: (laughs) This ends now!

(Anti-Pops kicks Pops away towards a black hole. Pops begins to get sucked in, but closes his fist and boosts himself forwards towards Anti-Pops. Anti-Pops gasps and also closes his fist, while boosting himself towards Pops)

Rigby: Dude, look!

(Mordecai looks at both their fists and realises that they're doing the same thing that they were told by the tapestry would reset the universe)

Mordecai: Oh no. Dude, the end is coming! We have to stop it! Hang on!

(Mordecai turns the ship around and starts flying it towards where Anti-Pops' and Pops' fists will collide)

Anti-Pops: Agh!

Pops: Agh!

(The ship fires lasers towards Anti-Pops' fist, but nothing happens)

Mordecai: It's not working!

Rigby: Dude, we gotta eject!

Mordecai: Not yet! We gotta fly between them!

Rigby: You're crazy!

(Mordecai and Rigby fly up in between Pops' and Anti-Pops' colliding fists)

Mordecai: Now!

(Rigby presses the Eject button, but it comes up with an error screen, and cannot eject them. Mordecai screams)

Rigby: N-n-n-n-n-n-no!

(The brothers' fists collide, causing Mordecai and Rigby to be erased from existence, and the universe to reset...)

(Part 3 begins exactly the way the first episode, The Power, did, with the same opening and title cards. Mordecai and Rigby are wrestling with a doll in their room)

Rigby: Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance to take back what you said about my mom!

(A doll lies silently on the floor) 

Rigby: I'll kill you!

(Rigby pats his elbow and jumps onto a trampoline, body-slamming the doll. He then elbows the doll multiple times, and body slams it once more. He picks up the doll and moves its arm, making it punch himself in the face. Behind him, Mordecai is calling to him)

Mordecai: Tag up! Tag up!

(Pretending to be weakened, Rigby walks over to Mordecai and high-fives him. As Rigby drinks a soda, Mordecai pulls the doll away. Rigby slams the soda can onto the ground and lets out a ferocious roar. Mordecai sets the doll up next to a bed before walking away onto the shelves)

Rigby: What?!

(There is silence) 

Rigby: Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?

(Mordecai grabs Rigby)

Rigby: I think he wants me to put the hurt on him!

Mordecai: I think he wants you to put the hurt on him!

Rigby: You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?!

Mordecai: Yes, I do!

(Mordecai & Rigby scream, as the latter is thrown down onto the trampoline, launching him into the wall. Suddenly, there's a slow-motion and Rigby has a sense of deja vu.)

Rigby: (in slow motion voice) Wait a minute, I think we've done this before! (screams)

(Rigby crashes into the wall, causing a large hole in the wall and Rigby in the trash can.)

Rigby: Ugh, ugh...

(Rigby removes the trash can)

Rigby: Yea-!! Hang on dude. This has happened before.

Mordecai: What? What are you talking about? No it hasn't.

Rigby: Yes it ha-!

(Rigby gasps as he has flashbacks to The Power, Hello China, The Dome Experiment, Cool Bro Bots, Space Escape, a scene where he was burying the Blu-ray box set in the ground, and shots from when Pops was fighting Anti-Pops)

Mordecai: Man, Are you okay? How hard did you hit your head?

Rigby: Medium hard, but that's not the point! We've seriously done this before!

Mordecai: I think you remember breaking a hole in the wall, We're gonna get fired for this.

Rigby: We're not gonna get fired. Not for this, Not smashing for Benson's car, or ruining everyone's Thanksgiving dinner! Not even for releasing demon in the park! (he laughs) We actually still have our jobs for like 6 years after this!

Mordecai: You're being insane. Even if you could see into the future, we'd totally get fired for all that stuff.

Rigby: I'm right, Mordecai. I can prove it.

(Cut to the outside, where Rigby is digging a hole to pull out the Blu-ray boxset)

Rigby: Here it is! The futuristic Blu-ray boxset that tells us the story of the next six years of our lives. Including all those times we didn't get fired, your relationship issues, plus when we went to space in a dome, and when the universe got destroyed by Pops' evil twin brother, Anti-Pops.

Mordecai: Dude, just holding up a box while you say crazy stuff doesn't prove anything.

Rigby: But it's all here on Blu-ray!

Mordecai: Ugh! You keep saying that, but Blu-ray just sounds as made-up as anything else. If it was a VHS boxset, you might have a case. Hey, you think if we sell this thing, we can make enough money to fix the ho-?

(Mordecai touches the Blu-ray boxset and has flashbacks to Do Me a Solid, Meteor Moves, Real Date, 1000th Chopper Flight Party, Rigby's Graduation Day Special, and the final battle)

Mordecai: (gasps) I remember! I remember! Huh?

(He sees a white silhouette of Benson next to the shed where he was supposed to be for his first appearance)

Mordecai: What's going on?! Huh?!

(He sees a white silhouette of Pops next to the fountain where he was supposed to be for his first appearance)

Mordecai: This isn't right!

Rigby: I think we're in a glitch and time didn't reset!

Mordecai: We gotta get back to help Pops!

Rigby: I know how we can do it!

(Mordecai and Rigby use The Power to travel to the end of the universe)

Mordecai & Rigby: (singing) Take us to the end! Take us to the end! Whoa! Won't you take us to the end?

(They disappear. Cut to the final battle, Pops and Anti-Pops are still fighting. Anti-Pops laughs) 

Anti-Pops: Say goodnight, Pops! (laughs evilly)

(Pops tackles Anti-Pops)

Pops: (furious) My friends! You've killed all my friends!

Anti-Pops: Yeah, and you're next!

(Mordecai and Rigby appear between them)

Mordecai & Rigby: Guess who's not dead after all!

Anti-Pops: What?!

Pops: (happy that some of his friends aren't dead) Mordecai! Rigby!

Mordecai: That's right! Just hit a little glitch in time!

Rigby: We'll always have your back, bro!

(Anti-Pops' hand, which has a giant red eye on it, appears behind Mordecai and Rigby

Anti-Pops: Not for long!

(Mordecai and Rigby shield themselves with The Power as Anti-Pops' hand shoots them)

Pops: No!

(The Power shatters as Mordecai and Rigby fall and land on Lolliland. Anti-Pops blasts the planet as they run, destroying it, making the blast knock Pops back to a space through a black hole. Pops loses his titan form, and lands in J.G. Quintel's original student film, The Naive Man from Lolliland. Pops looks towards the Naive Man)

Naive Man: I say, quite the handsome man in the newspaper, don't you think?

Waiter: Uh, sure. I'll be back in a second for the check.

Pops: Is that me? Hello? Hello? Where am I? What is this?

(Pops notices one of the tables being erased)

Pops: Anti-Pops!

(Pops jumps into the air and flies through the black hole, to find Anti-Pops, he sees Anti-Pops erasing everything while laughing. He hits a rock which Mordecai and Rigby are holding onto, causing them to separate)

Mordecai: Rigby! Hold on!

Rigby: Pops, help!

(Pops continues flying towards the fight, but approaches a group of giant letters spelling out REGULAR SHOW, he flies around and through them. Anti-Pops gets close to destroying Mordecai)

Mordecai: (screams)

Rigby: We're dead times a hundred! We're dead times a hundred!

Pops: Rigby!

(Rigby turns and sees Pops)

Rigby: Pops!

Pops: Give me your ha-

(Pops is hit by an adhesive sticky note with a sketch of Muscle Man on it)

Rigby: Pops!

(Pops throws the sticky note off him)

Pops: An adhesive note?

(A collection of sticky notes race towards Pops, pushing him away from Mordecai and Rigby. He screams)

Rigby: Dude! I'm freaking out!

(Suddenly, Rigby becomes a bunch of sticky note sketches. He screams while kicking his legs around)

Rigby: Agh! Help! Get it off! Get it off!

(Mordecai appears on a storyboard)

Mordecai: Agh! Dude, what the heck is going on?

(Anti-Pops appears in front of Mordecai and Rigby)

Anti-Pops: The fabric of reality is unravelling!

Pops: No!

(Anti-Pops goes to throw his fist towards Mordecai and Rigby)

Anti-Pops: (laughs)

Pops: Mordecai! Rigby! No!

(Pops remembers The Seer speaking to him a few episodes prior.

The Seer (memory): Sometimes, doing something different makes all the difference.

(Pops remembers earlier in the battle)

Pops (memory): We can still resolve this, brother.

(Pops remembers the events of Kill 'Em with Kindness)

Anti-Pops (memory): Ugh! I don't need a hug!

(Pops smiles, and uses his powers to push the sticky notes away. He teleports to save Rigby, who is screaming. He then teleports away, as Anti-Pops smashes the rock Rigby was holding onto. Pops teleports to grab Mordecai, then teleports away again before Anti-Pops destroys his rock)

Anti-Pops: Stop running!

(The trio land on a broken part of Lolliland)

Mordecai: Pops! He's too powerful! You'll never beat him alone!

Pops: I know you all mean well, but I should have been listening to my heart this whole time. You boys stay here.

(Pops boosts himself into the sky)

Anti-Pops: Pops! Show yourself, coward!

Pops: I'm here!

(Anti-Pops prepares his deathblow to Pops, as Pops smiles, spreads his arms out, and floats towards Anti-Pops to give him a hug)

Pops: Sh-sh-sh-sh-shh!

(Pops ends up giving Anti-Pops positive feelings, causing him to shrink back to his regular size)

Anti-Pops: No! Feelings!

(Mordecai and Rigby watch in shock and amazement.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Wha'...?

Anti-Pops: (frustrated after being hugged) Ugh, this can't work, Pops. The minute you let me go, I'm gonna blast you into nothing!

Pops: I know. So I'm not going to let go.

Anti-Pops: What?

(Anti-Pops notices that he and Pops are floating towards the Sun)

Anti-Pops: Agh, no! You'll kill us both, you fool!

Mordecai & Rigby: Pops, don't!

(Pops telepathically connects with Mordecai and Rigby, to say his final goodbye)

Pops: Don't worry, Mordecai and Rigby. I know you're sad, but I promise this is a happy ending. Take care of each other. Goodbye.

(Pops and Anti-Pops continue to zoom into the Sun. Anti-Pops' negativity is now gone. Realizes his brother still cares for him, Anti-Pops finally feels so much remorseful for his actions.)

Anti-Pops: My God...all those one-star reviews, (looks down in shame and guilt) I wish I could take it all back.

Pops: You can try. You and I together, brother.

(They both close their eyes, as Pops' hat disintegrates off his head. Pops and Anti-Pops share a hug, indicating that they've finally made peace with each other. Anti-Pops opens his eyes one last time to look up at his twin brother, in admiration. They both fly into the Sun, killing both of them, but reviving everybody who Anti-Pops had destroyed. Mordecai and Rigby are watching the Sun expand from afar, crying)

Mordecai: (sniffs) I guess this is it. If anyone's listening, I wanna come back as a dolphin.

Rigby: Oh, good one. (sniffs) Me too. No wait, an eagle! No! A pterodactyl! With a really big-

(Rigby's sentence is cut off as the universe returns to its regular state)

(A Channel 6 news broadcast begins, with Del Hanlon and Margaret presenting.

Del: Breaking news! Months after the return of domes around the world, and three years after their mysterious departure, it seems like we're getting reports that the Park Dome is finally back! It's back, everybody! It's back!

(David Bowie's Heroes begins to play. Margaret runs off to find her friends. The Park Dome is seen finally returning to Earth. The whole Park Crew, minus Pops, exits the dome, and are widely celebrated by a huge amount of pedestrians. Mordecai's parents run up to the Park Dome to hug and kiss Mordecai, followed by Rigby's parents and Don. Rigby's father, Sherm, gives Rigby a hug, and is clearly very relieved to have his son back. Starla follows with a special surprise for Muscle Man, their 3 year old daughter who Starla was pregnant with when they went to space. Muscle Man holds up his daughter and cries tears of joy that he's going to be father. Skips reunites with Techmo as they share a hug, and Margaret hugs Eileen. Hi Five Ghost reunites with Celia as they hug and spin around in happiness. Benson is reunited with Apple Sauce, who jumps up to him for a hug and satisfyingly sets him down. Rigby and Eileen have a long awaited kiss and blush towards each other. Mordecai looks over to Mr. Maellard, who is unable to reunite with his adopted son, Pops, for obvious reasons. Maellard wipes a tear away with a handkerchief, as Mordecai frowns towards him out of sympathy. He looks up towards the moon, as the scene transitions into the Sun, some time later. The Dome is no longer over the Park, and a statue of Pops has been put up in the Park as a memorial. The Park Crew are all in attendance at Pops' funeral, as Benson lays flowers next to his statue, which has a plaque that reads: "HE CHASED BUTTERFLIES. HE LOVED TO LAUGH. HE SAVED THE UNIVERSE. HE WAS OUR FRIEND. POPS MAELLARD" Some time after this, Mordecai and Rigby both quit their job at the Park after 6 years of work, and go separate ways. Mordecai shuts his car trunk, which contains memorabilia from the show, such as the Maximum Glove, Mordecai and the Rigbys T-Shirt, and Rigby's Eggscellent hat. He hugs Rigby and Eileen, who are moving in together. Rigby and Eileen drive off east of the Park, as Mordecai drives south. Some time later, we see Mordecai in an art studio painting, with visible stubble. Around the studio are paintings resembling Margaret, CJ and his friendship with Rigby. Transition to Rigby sometime in the future who now older, wears a green jacket and has a mustache, playing video games in his new house with his daughter. Eileen walks in with their other daughter, with some sandwiches. Transition to Benson, who has grown some hair and stubble back and is going gray, who has got back together with Pam, and is still working as the Park manager. He now wears a blue cap, and manages a zebra, hedgehog, a tree, a human, and Skips. Transition to Muscle Man and Starla, who now live in a cleaner trailer, and have five more children than before. Muscle Man is going bald and wears braces. Muscle Man and his kids all do Muscle Man's signature shirt spin, one last time. Skips is seen fixing a car in his garage, still working at the Park, drinking a mug of coffee, while wearing shorts. Hi Five Ghost and Celia are seen to now be living in the Czech Republic, working as DJs in Prague. Hi Five Ghost has a goatee and wears a beanie. Sometime soon, an older, more worn out, Mordecai meets a bat lady named Stef at an art conference, whom he falls in love with at first sight. Now, 25 years after the fight against Anti-Pops, the Park is having a reunion. Muscle Man is seen chasing his children, Eileen and Stef bond with each other, Benson, who now has a ponytail, and Pam both admire their cats and Apple Sauce. Mordecai and Stef's children are seen, all playing on their phones, while Rigby and Eileen's children help Muscle Man and Starla's children get candy from a Pops piñata. A statue of Mr. Maellard is placed next to Pops' statue, confirming that he has also passed away in the 25 years since the battle. Everybody gathers around the statues for a reunion photo. Later that night, Mordecai, who now has a beard and wears a beanie, a red hoodie and glasses, and Rigby are sat on the Park House steps drinking a soda, reminiscing their time at the Park)

Rigby: Man, I can't believe it's been twenty-five years.

Mordecai: Yeah, I wish Pops could've been here to see this.

Rigby: Well if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have this!

Mordecai: Yeah.

(Rigby takes a sip of his soda)

Mordecai: Hey, do you think those old video games are still in the shed?

Rigby: Yeah, we should check it out for old cart's sake!

(Mordecai and Rigby say their favorite catchphrase after 25 years.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph! OOHHH!! (laughs)

Mordecai: I can't believe we used to do that.

(Mordecai and Rigby both stand up and walk off, as the camera zooms out to show the House in its entirety. The screen then turns to static, and zooms out of a Hanatronic TV in Heaven, which is surrounded by butterflies. A VHS tape titled "REGULAR SHOW" is ejected from the tape deck on the TV, as we hear one certain voice, one final time)

Pops: Ah, jolly good show.

(End of An Epic Regular Final Battle + the series)

(The episode begins with a tornado warning being heard on the radio)

Announcer: This is an emergency alert. A freak storm is moving towards the city. Citizens are advised to stay in.

Techmo:(Taking pictures) Haha, yes! Wait till the followers of my extreme weather blog see this.

(Through the camera lens,  multiple things are seen flying around the tornado then a hot air balloon comes into view)

Techmo: What the?

(Techmo zooms in and sees a man in the hot air balloon.)

Techmo: Oh, no.

(Scene goes to the Park and Benson is getting everyone into the basement.)

Benson: (Using megaphone) Okay everybody, this is not a drill. The tornado is gonna hit us in minutes, go, go, go!

Mordecai and Rigby: (Come around the corner) Wait up!

Benson: (Using megaphone) Whoa, you guys actually got the emergency supplies?

Rigby: We got every kind of pizza pouch son!

Mordecai: Pepperoni pizza pouch, sausage pizza pouch, pepperoni sausage pizza pouch.

Benson: All you brought were pizza pouches?!

Mordecai: Well, yeah. Check this out though, tornado ready pizza pouch.

Benson: I'll yell at you later. Now get in!

(The hot air balloon is seen crashing into the trees and the person is seen falling to the ground)

Benson: Oh my gosh!

(Benson and Rigby run to the guy)

Skips: Hey, what's going on?

Mordecai: Someone just ate it in the trees!

(Mordecai and Skips run to help Benson and Rigby.)

Benson: Lift!

(They lift the man, before bringing him into the basement and close the basement doors)

Skips: Spread out, spread out!

(They set the guy down and Mordecai pulls the hat up; it reveals that the guy is a yeti, he is completely lookalike of Skips, but much younger. Skips gasps in shock and disbelief and goes up to him)

Pops: Skips, who is that young rapscalien?

Skips: It's me.

(Everyone gasps and the lights go out; Scene goes to later when the tornado passes and the Park is wrecked from the storm)

Muscle Man: So you're teenage Skips from the 18th century?

Walks: Tis true, but my name is Walks.

Skips: He's from before I changed my name to Skips.

Benson: How did you get here?

Walks: I was with my friend Sampson, and we were engaging in my favourite pastime. Stormchasing.

(A flshback begins with a storm and a tornado is being approached by two hot air balloons.)

Walks: (laughs) What a thril!

Sampson: (drawing the tornado) Wait'll the readers of my bog book see this!

Walks: Sampson! Tis' unfortunate to be your log book, I'm flying closer to the tornado, or my name isn't Walks! Tally ho! (flies into the tornado)

Sampson: Walks, no! You are a novice! (echoes)

(flashback ends)

Walks: "You are a novice!" And that's the last thing I remember.

Skips: I don't know how you're here, but if we don't return you to the past, a whole chain of events will never happen.

Walks: What are you on about?

Skips: In the years after the balloon incident, you change your name, meet some giant baby, yadda yadda yadda, and spoiler alert: you become immortal. If you're here, that never happens. In 24 hours, time is gonna catch up to me and I'll age rapidly and die! (to Mordecai and Rigby) Eh, don't you guys have a time machine?

Rigby: Sure, we had a bunch of 'em. But Mordecai broke 'em over a girl who ended up leaving him.

Mordecai: Hey, it was meutral.

Rigby: That's what they all say.

(Mordecai punches him.)

Rigby (continued): Ow!

(Muscle Man is reading a newspaper.)

Skips: How about you, Muscle Man? You tend to know a guy.

(Muscle Man yawns.)

Muscle Man: Yeah, I know a guy with time machines. He's real good. His dad basically invented 'em.

Benson: Alright, so what are we waiting for?

Muscle Man: You got cash?

Benson: I'll do you one better.

(Benson shows Muscle Man a cheque book.)

Muscle Man: You know who else is easily impressed by cat cheques? My mom! Yes!

(Muscle Man and Fives laugh and hi five. They walk out with Benson)

Skips: Alright! You guys go, we'll keep an eye on Walks.

Walks: This grows tiresome. What's say we have a bit of fun? You there, what do you enjoy doing?

Skips: I like to read.

(He hands Walks a book. It's called Ukkeep and Repair of Phonographs.)

Walks: Ugh. Whatever events led me to be such a bore I hope to never find out.

(He spits on the book and hands it back.)

Mordecai: Hey, lay off! Skips is cool!

Rigby: Yeah, you should see the work he does!

Walks: Work?

Skips: General upkeep, repairs, landscaping, manual labour, helping people around the park.

(Walks suddenly gets up.)

Walks: Helping people? I'll never help people.

(He starts running off.)

Walks (continued): My name is Walks, as in Walks never helps people!

(Skips blocks the doorway.)

Skips: You can't leave!

Walks: Why do you arrest me so?

Skips: If you learn too much about our time, you could alter history.

Walkss: Nonsense.

(He tries to go through, but Skips still blocks him.)

Walks (continued): Release me!

Skips: It's for your own good!

Walks: Ye be not my father!

(He gives up.)

Walks (continued): To think I should turn into you. A doddering old fool with no sense of adventure. I'll never change my name to Skips.

(Skips winces for a bit.)

Skips: It's okay, you can't help being like this. You'll grow out of it one day.

(Walks just spits, shrugging it off. He goes over to Mordecai and Rigby, who are playing a video game.)

Walks: Hey there, chaps. Pray tell, uh, what are doing?

Mordecai: Playing video games.

(He holds up the game called "Hot Air Balloonerz 5000".)

Walks: My word!

(He sits down next to them.)

Mordecai: Yeah, man. Give it a try.

(He gives Walks the controller. Walks starts playing the game.)

Walks: Unbelievable! This device...is it powered by hot air as well?

(Rigby takes out a pizza pouch.)

Rigby: Totally. Here, slam one of these.

(Walks is given the pizza pouch. He opens and begins eating it.)

Walks: Tally-hooooooo! This is the future I can get behind!

(We pan over to Pops and Skips. Skips groans.)

Pops: Are you alright?

(Skips covers his face.)

Skips: Uh, yeah. I'll be fine.

(When he uncovers his face, it has aged. Pops screams at this.)

Skips (continued): What?

(Pops takes out a lollipop and shows it like a mirror. Skips sees his reflection.)

Skips (continued): No, no! The timeline is catching up.

(Muscle Man, Fives and Benson return.)

Muscle Man: No go, bro. Turns out my boy went back in time and bumped into his dad, and then his parents never met. I guess he faded from existence or something. You know how it goes.

Pops: Now what do we do?

(Mordecai and Rigby appear through the hallway.)

Mordecai: We've got some ideas.

Rigby: Yeah, we can order one. It only takes six weeks to ship. Or was is six months?

Mordecai: I've heard good thing about the Bermuda Triangle.

Skips: No, no! The only way is to catch up to the storm. Send him back the way he came.

Rigby: I was totally about to suggest that.

Mordecai: Yeah. Let's do that.

Skips: It's impossible without state-of-the-art stormchasing equipment.

Pops: Oh, I've got some.

(He holds it up.)

Skips: No. There's only one person who has what we need, and I don't even know if he still chases storms.

(Techmo opens the door.)

Techmo: Did you see it?

Skips: Techmo!

Walks: Sampson!

Techmo: When I saw the balloon, I knew to come here.

(He replays the scene from the camera on his arm.)

Techmo (continued): Oh no, Skips' balloon. I need to go to the park.

Mordecai: So you know about the tornado?

Techmo: Timenado. I was with Walks when he caught in the 1700s.

(He projects a screen with his eye.)

Techmo (continued): It was the baddest storm we ever chased. And now it's back.

Rigby: You're a technomancer and a storm chaser?

Techmo: Yes.

Rigby: Could you be any cooler?

Techmo: Does having a panini maker in my arm answer your question?

(He reveals it.)

Rigby: Uh huh.

Techmo: There'll be plenty more time to compliment me later. We got a timenado to catch.

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Walks and Techmo: Tallyhoooo!

(Cut to outside. Muscle Man, Fives, Thomas, Pops and Benson wave as the Delerean DMC-12 takes off toward the timenado with Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Walks and Techmo inside.)

Walks: What matter of carriage is this? Where have you hidden the horses?

Mordecai: Uh, it's a secret.

(Behind him and Rigby, Skips' chair turns around. He falls to the ground, stable and still aging.)

Mordecai, Rigby, Techmo and Walks: Skips!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Walks go to him.)

Techmo: Mordecai, I need you to take the console.

(Mordecai does so. Rigby and Walks continue to support him.)

Rigby: Dude, he's fading.

Techmo: Talk to him!

Walks: Uhh, stop dying, you old fool!

(Skips groans.)

Techmo: Uh, Skips, remember when I was possessed by a computer virus, and then we had an epic sledgehammer battle?

(Skips laughs weakly.)

Walks: What? Did that really happen?

Mordecai: How about when you defeated Klorgbane with the Fists of Justice?

Skips: Yeah, that was awesome.

Rigby: Or, or, when you saved our skins by being mind-blowingly heroic? Which is like, every day.

Walks: Huh. Perhaps you aren't as meek as I thought.

(He pats Skips.)

Walks (continued): Eh, nice work.

(Skips smiles and closes his eyes. Mordo is looking through the radar.)

Mordecai: Techmo, it's moving into delta quadrant!

Techmo: Roger.

(He takes a right turn.)

Techmo (continued): Talk to me.

Mordecai: North east!

(Techmo drives off the road and on the shore. Rigby, Skips and Walks scream. Techmo eventually gets back onto the road.)

Techmo: Timenado visual confirmed!

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips and Walks: Whooooaaa.

(They approach the timenado. We see a closeup of it, panning from bottom to top. Many objects are revolving around the timenado. Techmo swerves his car as some objects nearly hit him. It is now ahead of the timenado.)

Techmo: Proceed with Phase 2.

(Mordecai pushes a button, causing the car's boot to burst open, revealing a hot-air balloon. The sunroof is also open.)

Techmo: Alright, Walks! Once you're in your balloon, Mordo and Rigs'll ease you into the core of the timenado! You'll find a portal home there!

(As Techmo says this, Walks listens while Mordecai and Rigby put up a ladder for the balloon, the former climbing up through the sunroof. Walks approaches the near-ending Skips.)

Walks: Skips, I can tell that living our life will be the greatest adventure of all, But I'm still not changing my name.

Skips: You just gotta...(inhales) meet the right girl.

(Walks smiles and pats Skips before heading off. He bumps into a box of pizza pouches that tumble out. He licks his lips at the sight. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby at the balloon. Walks comes climbing through the sunroof.)

Mordecai: Walks! What took ya?

Walks: Nothin'!

(He runs into the hot air balloon, his arm over his jacket. Mordecai notices this.)

Mordecai: Hey! Do you have something under your jacket?

Walks: Art thou a judge? Am I on trial here?

(A pizza pouch falls out of his jacket. Rigby gasps.)

Rigby: Dude! Our pizza pouches!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump into the balloon. Rigby puts down the control.)

Rigby: Hand 'em over and nobody gets-

(Walks punches him, causing his elbow to hit the "release" button, releasing the balloon, connected to a wire with Mordecai, Rigby and Walks on it as it flies around the Timenado. Techmo notices an error.)

Techmo: What the...

Car Voice: Auto-pilot.

(Techmo runs out of his seat as Skips gasps weakly, then Techno jumps out of his car and sees the balloon flying around the Timenado)

Techmo: What a mess!

(A viking boat falls and gets tangled up with the wire as Walks touches the lever to make the balloon go higher. Techmo draws out his sword, hops on the viking boat and cuts the wire off, making the balloon go into the Timenado as Techmo's car stops. As balloon gets inside the Timenado, a giant crystal at the center of the Timenado creates portals through time.)

Walks: Look! (Points to a portal to the 1700s where Sampson is on his hot air balloon looking for Walks.)

Sampson: Walks! Walks! (sees Walks) Walks!

Walks: Let's go!

(A Great Sphinx head hits the balloon, causing to knock Walks off, but Mordecai and Rigby grab him as the 1700s portal is slowly closing)

Sampson: We don't have much time! Hurry!

(Mordecai and Rigby swing Walks to the portal, sending him through the portal back to the 1700s and Walks lands on Sampson's hot air balloon as the portal closes. Skips returns to normal age.)

Skips: Can this thing fly?

Techmo: Does this answer your question?

(Techmo presses the "yes" button as his car flys to the Timenado to save Mordecai and Rigby, who are still in it. As Mordecai and Rigby hang on to Walks' hot air balloon, a portal opens to reveal a high school as past versions of Mordecai and Rigby walk by and notice it.)

Past Mordecai: Dude, check out this portal, dude. It looks like older us.

Mordecai: It's us in high school!

Rigby: No! Anything but that!

(Techmo's car flies into the Timenado as Mordecai and Rigby are about to be sucked into the portal, but Skips saves them and the car flies back to the park. Mordecai and Rigby get out of the car.)

Skips: Thanks, Techmo.

Techmo: Hey, now we're even.

(Skips gets out of the car as Techmo drives off as the techno remix of "Yankee Doodle" plays briefly before the car disappears.)

Pops: Everyone, Skips is back!

(He, Benson, Muscle Man, Fives and Thomas run up to Skips)

Pops: Thank goodness you're alright.

Benson: Good to have you back, Skips. (Shakes Skips' hand)

Muscle Man: Don't go almost dying on me again, bro.

Skips: Eh, I'll see what I can do. (as Mordecai and Rigby are about to walk away) Mordecai and Rigby, come with me.

(We cut time Skips' house where Skips opens his attic with ladders come out of it and they climb up the attic.)

Skips: Uh, let me get the light. (Turns on the light to reveal ancient artifacts from his travels around the world)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Mordecai: Skips, this is incredible. You kept mementos from all of your adventures?

Skips: Yeah. But this one's for you guys.

(Hands over a picture to Mordecai and Rigby to see a photo of Walks and the Guardians of Eternal Youth eating pizza pouches and writing that says "Thanks Mordecai and Rigby. Tally-ho!". Episode ends.)

(Episode begins with Skips's house. Skips comes in holding his mail. He turns on his stove, lights wood, and turns on his fan. He gets into a lotus position on his mat and sighs. He picks up the mail and sees a card. His eyes widen when he opens it.)

Quips: What do you get when you put a ball with a chain? Two people getting married. (Skips smiles) Zin-

(Skips flips the card over. He discovers that it is an invitation to the wedding of Quips and Monica.)

Skips: Hey, Quips is getting married. Aww.

(He hears knocking and answers the door)

Quips: You get the invite, cous?

Skips: Uh, yeah.

Quips: Good. I was so excited that I had it sent overnight at great expense.

Skips: Well, eh, congratulations. I can't wait to meet the lucky lady.

Quips: And she can't wait to meet the (Pokes chest) "best man", buddy.

Skips: Best man?

(Quips puts a "Best Man" cap on Skips and waves flags around while blowing into a party favor)

Quips: But in all honesty, Skips, I don't have a lot of friends. So I need you to be my best man. Anyway, what's a composer's favorite kind of party?

Skips: So what do I gotta do?

Quips: You gotta throw me a "Bachelor" party! I just changed the joke up on the fly to answer your question.

Skips: Bachelor party? I've never done one of those before.

Quips: Oh, you'll do great. I just have one request.

Skips: Huh?

Quips: At the end of the night, I wanna eat "wings on a hill" with my best buds. Well, your best buds. Hey, can I borrow your best buds? Just to reiterate, I don't have any friends.

Skips: Sure, no problem.

Quips: Thanks, best man. Or should I say, "chest man"? (Pats Skips's chest) Badabadabadaba zingo! Hey, can you spot me for a cab home?

(Cut to Pops' House, where Mordecai and Rigby are laughing. They are in the kitchen.)

Mordecai: Sack lunch!

Rigby: Sack lunch!

(They laugh while putting sacks on the table)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Slapping sacks together) Lunch! Lunch! Lunch! Lunch!

(They stop when they hear Skips on the phone)

Skips: No, what do you mean you're closed for a private party?

Wing Kingdom Manager: Well, exactly what I said. We're closed for a private party today. You're gonna have to get your wings somewhere else.

(Skips grunts and hangs up)

Mordecai: What's the matter, Skips?

Rigby: You want some licorice, bro?

Skips: Wing Kingdom is closed, and I need to get wings for a bachelor party.

(Muscle Man bursts in with Hi Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Did some- (Stops to catch his breath) -Did somebody say "bachelor party"?

Skips: I don't know the first thing about bachelor parties.

Muscle Man: You just gotta do a bunch of crazy stuff to celebrate your bro's last night of freedom.

Skips: But isn't he already in a long-term monogamous relationship?

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other) 

Rigby: Maybe we should help.

(He eats some licorice as Mordecai begins to speak.)

Mordecai: So who's it for?

Skips: My cousin, Quips.

Guys: Uhh....

Rigby: Well, it's...still a bachelor party.

Muscle Man: Still a bachelor party.

Mordecai: It's still a bachelor party.

Rigby: And there'll be wings.

Muscle Man: And there'll be wings.

Mordecai: And there'll be wings. We'll take care of everything, Skips. All you gotta worry about is the wings.

Skips: Thanks, guys.

(Cut to Quips performing as a clown at a birthday party)

Quips: What animal is like an insect that secretly gets married? An antelope!

Kid #1: Boo!

Kid #2: Don't quit your day job!

Quips: This is my day job. Ahem. What do you get if you-

Kid #1: Get off the stage, loser!

Quips: Whew, tough crowd.

(Gets punched in the chest by Kid #1)

Quips (continued): Really..tough crowd.

(Another kid puts a paper bag over his head) 

Quips (continued): What the--

(Kid grabs him) 

Quips (continued): Where are you taking me?!

Kid #1: (To frightened kids) You don't tell anybody what you saw!

(The kids only quiver in fear and look at each other. The scene then cuts to Quips, who is in the middle of having the paper bag removed. The camera zooms out, revealing the three children who kidnapped Quips. Quips quickly begins to beg for mercy.)

Quips: Please... spare my life! Take anything you want!

(The kid who put the paper bag over Quips's head unzips his costume, revealing a well disguised Rigby. Quips smiles in response.)

Quips (continued): Ahhhhhh.....

(He turns to look at the other two kids, who are really just Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost in disguise. They begin laughing.)

Quips (continued): Oh, no....

(Muscle Man attaches a ball and chain to Quips's leg)

Quips (continued): It's really happening!

(Mordecai rolls down a window and smiles)

Mordecai: Welcome to your bachelor party, dude.

Quips: Wow!

(Looks around excitedly)

Quips (continued): Am I in a limo?

(The camera then focuses on Skips, who is up front in the passenger seat. He is on the phone, trying to get ahold of a place that sells wings.)

Skips: No wings? At all? 

(Hangs up)

Skips (continued): (Frustrated) Oh, why'd today have to be National Wing Day?

(He crosses out Thighs Guys on his list of wing joints. Quips suddenly appears behind him, a big grin plastered on his face.)

Quips: Skips, this is a dream come true! Thanks for--(Throws up his hands)--No, wait. I'm gonna tell this to everyone.

(He sits back down and addresses everybody in the room)

Quips (continued): Thanks, everybody. This really means a lot. Now, enough with the conversation- let's start the (Points) celebration!

(Thrusts his arms back against his sides)

Quips (continued): Zingooooooo! Come on, guys; zingo with me.

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Mordecai: (Shrugs) Bachelor party, dude.

All (except Skips): Zingooooo!

(A montage of the bachelor party begins. Mordecai is shown concentrating before rolling a bowling ball and knocking down all ten pins. Rigby rolls next, managing to get a strike as well. Quips walks up next, determined to knock down some pins. The camera quickly pans over to the pins as he takes his turn, although they don't seem to be affected by his roll. The camera pans back over to Quips, who realizes that he was trying to roll the ball that was attached to his ankle. The camera then proceeds to zoom in on Skips, who is on the phone trying to contact a wing joint. He frowns and crosses out Wicky Wild Wild Wings on his list. Quips is then seen riding in a bumper car, a big smile on his face. In the car right behind him, Skips is on the phone once again, a look of worry evident on his face. He scribbles out Guess Who's Coming To Winger? on his list. The scene then transitions to a paintball fight. Quips puts down his protective face mask and blasts Skips with paint. Skips seems to be unaware of what is happening as he continues to speak on the phone. He crosses out Ding-A-Wings on his list. The scene changes to a Carter and Briggs stuntman tryout. Briggs is seen winking at Quips before Quips does donuts in the limo. Meanwhile, Skips crosses out Wingin' It And Blingin' It on his list. Quips is then shown standing on top of an alligator as the guys look on. Skips crosses out Wing Suit Riot, 12 Angry Wings, and If You Like It Put A Wing On It on his list. Rigby, Muscle Man, Fives and Quips are then heard shouting "Zingo!" as they stick their head out of the limo's sunroof. Skips is also shown dejectedly staring at his list, for all of the wing joints in town are out of wings. The montage ends with a clock transition.)

Quips: Man, this bachelor party's been perfect! Speaking about perfect bachelor parties, (points at Skips) how's those wings coming, Skips?

Skips: Uh, yeah of course, uh, but uh... (Shrugs) bachelor party rules! Time for the, uh... blindfold activity!

(Quips gasps as Mordecai ties a blindfold around Quips's head)

Quips: (Excitedly) Just like in the movies!

Skips: Uh, Mordecai and Rigby.... (Points) could I see you privately for a second?

(Mordecai and Rigby are then seen opening one of the limo's doors)

Mordecai: What's up, Skips?

(They enter the limo)

Rigby: How's the wing search?

Skips: I called every place in town. There's no wings anywhere! What should I do?

Mordecai and Rigby: (Look at each other) Uh....

Mordecai: You gotta try Wing Kingdom again.

Rigby: Yeah; maybe the private party's over!

Skips: Worth a shot.

(The limo is seen driving up to Wing Kingdom. Skips skips into the restaurant and addresses the manager.)

Skips (continued): Uh, excuse me; I'd like a few dozen wings.

Wing Kingdom Manager: We're closed for a private party.

Skips: It's for my cousin! Can't you just spare a few?

Wing Kingdom Manager: Sorry, sir. They're animals in there.

(He gestures to another room, where the private party is being held. Loud screams and breaking glass can be heard.)

Wing Kindom Manager (continued): (Shrugs) I can't spare a single wing.

Skips: (Begging) Please! 

(Grabs the manager's shoulders) 

Skips (continued): I'm the best man! I can't let him down!

Wing Kingdom Manager: Pffft. Some best man. 

(Begins to walk away)

Wing Kingdom Manager (continued): Can't even find a few wings.

(Skips sighs and worriedly grabs a Wing Kingdom bag, stuffing napkins into it. Cut back to Quips and the guys in the limo.)

Quips: That's a great idea!

(Skips joins them)

Quips (continued): You got those wings, best man?

Skips: Uh, yep.

Quips: You know, "Wings on a Hill" is a Quippenger tradition.

Skips: Is....that....so?

Quips: You bet. My dad did it with his friends, my grandfather did it, and now me with my bros and my best man carrying on the tradition. All this wing talk is making me hungry. (Clasps and rubs his stomach) How long 'till wing time?

Skips: Uh...it's coming.

Quips: Well, can I at least have a whiff to tide me over?

Skips: I don't think that-

(Quips grabs the bag of "wings" and shakes it)

Quips: Huh, a lighter than I thought it'd be.

Skips: Uhh....

(Quips sniffs the inside.)

Quips: Not much of a scent....What flavor is this?

Skips: Uhh, the best one. Why don't you give me that back?

Quips: Maybe if I just take a peek.

(Quips removes his blindfold and peeks)

Skips: Wait!

(Quips sees that there are napkins in place of the wings)

Quips: Is this some kinda joke?

Skips: Uh, listen...

Quips: Because if it is, you should say, "Zingo". Because people might get the wrong idea if you don't say "Zingo" after the hilarious joke.

Skips: Let me explain.

Quips: (Begins to whimper) Very funny, Skips!

(Rigby places a hand on Quips)

Rigby: Come on, try and calm down.

(Quips motions himself away from Rigby's hand)

Quips: You don't understand. The only Quippenger who didn't eat "wings on a hill" was left at the altar!

(Quips buries his head in his hands and cries)

Skips: Quips, I'm sorry. I tried everywhere.

Muscle Man: Ahem. Not everywhere, bro.

(Scene cuts to a night sky in a bayou where fireflies fly everywhere. A fly flutters by, then a frog eats the fly, and then a dragonfly picks up the frog and flies away.)

Mordecai: "Wings For Real Men"?

Rigby: Yeah, we can read.

(They walk on a bridge to a small restaurant)

Muscle Man: This place is really off the grid. Real hush-hush. They take their wings super seriously.

(They go inside the "Wings For Real Men" restaurant to find no one there)

Skips: Hello?

(Someone opens the door. Skips and Quips look at each other. A guy with a beard, a guy eating wings, and a chef walk up to them.)

Guy #1: Well, lookie here! We got several fancy city folk, from the biiig city!

Skips: I need a bucketa wings to go.

Guy #1: You walk in here with your fancy pants, running water, your electricity, and your special-edition DVDs, and expect us to give you our buckets?!

Skips: What about that?

(There is a sign that says "Inferno Wing Challenge - Free Wings for Life")

Skips (continued): (Grabs sign) Free wings for life, huh?

Guy #1: Oh, you wouldn't be able to handle those. They're for real men.

Mordecai: We're men!

Muscle Man: No women here.

Hi Five Ghost: I haven't seen a woman all day.

Guy #1: Nobody's ever survived the Inferno Challenge!

(We are shown "people who died trying the Inferno Challenge") (In the UK, the sign shows "People who stopped living trying the Inferno Challenge". due to the word "died" being too inappropriate. This censor is also used in Australia.)

Guy #1: Our wing sauce is made from mutated ghost peppers, hot magma extract, and black widow venom.

Skips: I'll do it.

(A plate, a towelette, a bucket of wings, and blue cheese dip are set up for Skips)

Guy #2: But you don't get the blue cheese!

(The chef whacks it against the wall, where a bunch of other blue cheese containers lay)

Guy #3: You got two minutes to eat that whole bucket.

(Skips picks up an Inferno wing. Some sauce drops from the wing and burns through the table. Skips and the guys gasp.)

Quips: Skips, don't do it! Maybe being left at the altar won't be so bad!

Skips: I promised you those wings, and you're gonna get 'em.

(Skips starts the timer. He cools off the first wing, then eats it. He breathes out hot breath and drops the bone. He cools off the second wing, and begins to bite, when the sauce causes pain in his mouth. The guys gasp. Skips sticks out his tongue, which is burning from the sauce. The three guys laugh at this. Skips grabs a third wing and cools it off before eating it. He groans in pain. After a large round of wings, Skips's body is all hot and scruffy.)

Guy #1: Tick-tock, city boy! Ain't that what your fancy watches say?

(Skips groans and reaches back into the bucket for another wing)

Mordecai: Come on, Skips! You're almost there!

(As Mordecai says this, the camera focuses back onto Skips, who is severely scruffy and shaken up)

Mordecai (continued): (Voice slows down) Just three more wings...

(The camera pans around to everybody in the room, including the amused chef and his men and an anxious looking Quips. The camera then focuses back on the bucket, which is almost flaming in anticipation. Skips picks up another wing and groans before blacking out. He is then seen waking up in an actual inferno.)

Skips: Huh?

(He looks at his surroundings. Some strange beings are then seen marching nearby.) 

Zingos: (Chanting) Zingo, zingo, zingo, zingo, zingo!

(They menacingly loom over Skips, who looks up in surprise)

Zingo #1: We are the zingos. (Hisses) This... is the inferno!

Skips: I... I gotta... finish this! 

(Before he can do so, however, Zingo #1 knocks him off of the miniature cliff they are standing on)

Zingo #1: Never!

(Skips slides down the cliff and manages to hang onto a piece of celery. He then looks down at the river of blue cheese below him. The zingos slide down the cliff and land right in front of Skips, almost knocking him into the estuary of dressing. One of the zingos stomps on Skips's hand, almost causing him to lose his grip. He moans in pain and somehow manages to hold on.)

Zingo #1: You've let down your own family!

(He roars and attempts to stomp on Skips's hand again, but Skips manages to grab hold of his leg and stop him)

Skips: (Determined) He's gonna get those wings!

(He throws the zingo over the edge of the cliff. Zingo #1 manages to land on a piece of cliff that had broken off in the middle of the river. He looks up angrily at Skips in response. Skips then proceeds to leap into the air and knock the other two zingos' heads together, providing him with enough time to bite one of the zingos. The zingo screams in agony before turning into a regular chicken wing, which Skips consumes. He spits out the bones, which end up piercing the other zingo in the side. It screams in pain as Skips skips over and punches it in the face. The zingo in turn manages to punch Skips back, but in doing so, Skips latches onto his arm and bites it. The zingo screams again before turning into a regular wing as well. SKips bites into it successfully before noticing Zingo #1 in the river.)

Zingo #1: (Tauntingly) Zingo. Zingo! Zingo, zingo, zingo.

(Skips hops down from the cliff and lands on one of the cliff fragments floating in the river. He hops from fragment to fragment until he manges to land on the same piece the zingo is standing on. Zingo #1 and Skips begin to punch one another, each delivering a few good blows until the zingo leaps behind Skips and catches him by surprise. Zingo #1 manages to knock Skips over, and shortly after doing so, he wraps his arm around Skips and holds him captive.)

Zingo #1: (continued): You failed him, Skips. Just like you failed Desdemona!

Skips: Noooooo!

(Skips wraps his arms around the zingo and thrusts him in front of his own body, right before they meet up with a blue cheese waterfall. Zingo #1 screams "zingo" one last time before being drenched in blue cheese dressing. He immediately explodes and turns into a regular wing, which Skips eats. The inferno is then seen being doused with rain. Skips victoriously shouts "zingo"  and sighs in relief. He is then shown back in the real world, where he is being doused with lemonade while the guys cheer him on.)

Quips: You did it.

Skips: (Points over at the chef and his men) Now hand over the wings!

Guy #1: Didn't you read the fine print?

(He hands over the picture of the Inferno Wing Challenge and laughs. Skips dusts off the layer of filth covering the fine print, which reads: "Except if'n you're fancy.")

Guy #1 (continued): We don't gotta give you no nothing! No how! So why don't you pack up your big city friends, and your big city shaved chest, and hightail it outta-

(Skips punches him before he can finish)

Skips: Run!

(Skips, with the wings in hand, runs out of the restaurant with Quips and the guys)

Guy #1: Curse you, big city shaved chest!

(The restaurant cracks off the bridge and sinks into the lake)

Guy #1: You're gonna pay for this!

(Cut to the sunrise at the park, where Quips, Skips, and the guys are eating wings)

Quips: Thanks, Skips. That was the best night of my life.

Skips: Ahh, it's what best men do.

(A car drives up to them)

Quips: (Sitting up) Monica!

(The front window rolls down, revealing Monica in the driver's seat)

Monica: Hello, everyone.

Quips: How was your bachelorette party, babe?

Monica: Well, we rented out Wing Kingdom and we ate wings there all night. I had a very good time.

Quips: Haha. (To guys) See? That's why she's gonna wear my "wedding wing"!

(The guys all pump their arms)

Quips and guys: Zingo!

(Monica laughs)

Monica: He's so funny.

(End of Bachelor Party! Zingo!!)

(Episode starts with Mordecai, Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen coming out of the theater after watching Crime Town Diaries)

Mordecai: So, what did you guys think?

Margaret: Yeah, you know, it was pretty good.

Eileen: I think I'm gonna like the remake better.

Rigby: They don't call it Crime Town for nothing, baby! '(makes a machine gun sound)

Mordecai: Well, I'm glad you liked it. I missed all the best parts, cause you were trying to talk to me!

Rigby: Dude, I still don't know what you're talking about! Like I said, it wasn't me!

Mordecai: Whatever.

Margaret: So, what's next?

Mordecai: Who's down for some of my famous home made Morde-shakes?

Rigby: Yeah ok!

Eileen: Sounds good!

Margaret: Yeah...alright sure!

(They all drive back to the house and Margaret parks the car in front of the garage)

Margaret: So, what's in a Morde-shake again?

Mordecai: It's a surprise.

Rigby: (To Eileen) It's just a regular milkshake. (To Mordecai) You're really gonna load up on desserts after that Chili-dog incident?

Margaret: Ugh! Yeah, so gross!

Eileen: Don't remind me.....

Mordecai: What? There's always room for dessert, especially when the dessert is Morde-shakes! Oh shoot, I forgot something in the car. I'll be right back.

(Mordecai walks to Margaret's car, and looks around for his personal item which turns out to be his wallet, Margaret has followed him to the car to check up on him)

Margaret: What's up?

Mordecai: I can't find my wallet.

Margaret: Oh, let's see...(She also joins Mordecai in the car, helping him look for his wallet, then she leans over his seat) Did you check the glove compartment?

Mordecai: Yeah, I checked there... (They realize that they are close to one another once again) already....

Margaret: Oh, ha.....

Mordecai: Ha. (They stare at each other, Mordecai gulps, and leans in with Margaret joining in, and they kiss. Then Margaret opens her eyes and looks disgusted, and pushes Mordecai away) Oh sorry, I shouldn't--

Margaret: No, it's fine. It's just-

Mordecai: What?

Margaret: Your breath is really bad.....

Mordecai: Ahh!....oh my gosh. Uhh. (Reaches for the door handle to get out of the car)

Margaret: Wait, no! It's--

Mordecai: I'm sorry! (He exits out of the car to run back into the house) I'm sorry!

Margaret: Mordecai!

Rigby: Yeah, you know, I came up with the name Morde-shakes. So technically-

Mordecai: Morde-shakes are canceled. Good night Eileen.

Rigby: Wait, what?

Mordecai: I need to talk to you. Come on (He takes hold of Rigby's arm and pulls him back into the house quickly while closing the door at the same time)

Rigby: (After being pulled into the house by Mordecai) Whoa!

Eileen: Uh....good night?

(Mordecai and Rigby have returned to their room, and Mordecai releases Rigby's arm)

Mordecai: Oh man, this is bad. This is really bad.

Rigby: Dude, what is it?

Mordecai: I kissed Margaret.

Rigby: Whoa,....I own Muscle Man so much money.

Mordecai: Ugh! I'm such an idiot.

Rigby: But that's what you wanted, what's the problem? (He smirks) Did you have bad breath, or something?

Mordecai: Awwwwww! I did!

Rigby: Seriously? You didn't check first?

Mordecai: I was in the moment!

Rigby: (He takes out a small case of mint) You gotta pack a mint, bro.

Mordecai: Argh! That was our first kiss, and I blew it! (He lies back on his bed) I'm never gonna be able to face her again. I wish I could just take it back.

Rigby: Sounds like you need a Time Machine.

Mordecai: Ha, yeah, I wish (Gasps) Wait, you mean you still have it?

Rigby: Oh, you mean the Time Machine you said was a scam, and a waste of money.

Mordecai: Well yeah, who sells a Time Machine for $15?

Rigby: It was on sale!

Mordecai: So, can I still use it?

Rigby: Only if you admit you actually think it's really cool.

Mordecai: Dude, quit messing around. My life is on the line!

Rigby: Okay, okay geez. (runs to the closet, and grabs a ball-looking Time Machine)

Mordecai: That's it? It looks kinda junky.

Rigby: Oh, so I guess you don't wanna use it then.

Mordecai: No no, I'm sorry! How does it work?

Rigby: I don't know. I never used it before. (Presses the button a few times)

Mordecai: Gimme. Where's the on switch?

Rigby: Dude, you're gonna break it!

Mordecai: I just wanna go back to 15 minutes ago! (Clicks it to 15 minutes ago, and they are teleported back outside the park) Whoa, where are we?

Rigby: This thing just sent us outside.

Mordecai: No dude, look! (They see their past selves) There we are!

Past Rigby: Your really gonna load up on desert after that Chili-dog incident.

Rigby: Whoa, this is weird.

Mordecai: Shoot. Here I come. (They hide in the bushes)

Rigby: Well, do something.

Mordecai: Like what?

Rigby: I don't know.

Mordecai: I can't just barge in there.

Rigby: Well, here comes Margaret. Hehe. Look at how nervous you are. (Deep voice) Hey baby, can you help me find what I'm looking for? (Girlish voice) Okay.

Mordecai: Dude, quit it. (They now get teleported back to the present)

Rigby: What happened?

Mordecai: I didn't touch it.

Rigby: Man, must be kinda glitchy.

Mordecai: That's what you get for $15.

Rigby: Hey, but it worked! I can't believe it! Let me see for a sec. (He grabs the Time Machine) Go back two months ago. (He disappears and appears again) HAHA! Awesome!

Mordecai: Dude, Quit fooling around! Ok, so what's a fast way we would can fix my bad breath in the past? So when I'll kiss Margaret, it's not bad.

Rigby: I told you man: Mints.

Mordecai: Okay, yeah. We'll go back earlier in the night, and give my past self a mint. (pushes the button) two hours ago. (They teleport back inside the theater, when Mordecai, Rigby, Eileen and Margaret are watching the movie) You got those mints?

(Rigby gives to Mordecai the mints. Mordecai throws the mints to the Past Mordecai)

Past Mordecai: What the...? (Looks behind him. He doesn't see anybody because Mordecai and Rigby are hidden)

Rigby: Dude, that's not gonna work.

Mordecai: Well, I don't want me to see me.

Rigby: Here. (Grabs the mints)

Mordecai: Rigby, wait!

Rigby: (Talking to Past Mordecai) Psst, hey, Mordecai.

Past Mordecai: Shhh!

Rigby: Dude, you want some mints?

Past Mordecai: What? No dude. Shush.

Rigby: Come on, they're really good. Here, take a couple.

Past Mordecai: Dude, Quit it! (Grabs Rigby's hand)

Rigby: Just take 'em!

Past Mordecai: STOP! (Mints get out of the box causing noise)

All: SHHHH!

Past Margaret: Mordecai!

Past Rigby: Dude, we're trying to watch the movie!

Past Mordecai: Yeah, then you stop trying to... wait. (Looks behind him)

(Mordecai and Rigby return to the present)

Mordecai: Ugh. Why wouldn't I just take a mint?

Rigby: I don't know man. But you wouldn't need a mint, if you haven't eaten that Chili-Dog earlier.

Mordecai: That's it! I'll just stop myself from eating it. (They now get teleported back outside the movie theater, and the past Mordecai is about to order a Chili-Dog.) Shoot. I'm about to order. Ugh, if only that truck wasn't there.

Rigby: You got it. Follow me.

Vendor: (Talking to Past Mordecai) You know what you want?

Past Mordecai: Yeah, let me get a sloppy dan dog, with extra onions. (Rigby and Mordecai take off the wheel stopper from the truck.)

Vendor: Extra? You sure?

Past Mordecai: Yeah. Pile 'em on.

Vendor: One sloopy dan with--. What the--? (The truck rolls down the hill, which leads to a crash off-screen. And the past Mordecai picks up his Chili-Dog from the ground, and eats it, while the past Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen are grossed out.)

Past Mordecai: What? Five-second rule.

Mordecai: Ugh. That was really gross.

Rigby: See, I told you.

(They get teleport back to the present.)

Mordecai: Agh. What's wrong with me?!

Rigby: Yeah man, I can't believe Margaret let you kiss her.

Mordecai: Quiet! If only I eaten something earlier, I wouldn't even wanted that dumb Chili-Dog. Seven hours ago.

(They get teleported back to The Coffee Shop)

Past Margaret: Hey, saved you guys the last piece of apple pie.

Past Mordecai: No thanks.

Past Rigby: Yeah, we're saving room for Chili-Dogs tonight.

Past Margaret: Okay.

(The present Mordecai then comes in)

Mordecai: Margaret, we'll take that pie after all.

Past Margaret: Sure. Here you go.

Past Mordecai: What? We said no.

Past Margaret: Huh?

Past Rigby: Yeah Chili-Dogs tonight, remember?

Past Margaret: Oh. Sorry, its been a long day.

(Present Rigby then comes in this time)

Rigby: Margaret, where's the pie. Can we get some sandwiches too, with fries?

Past Margaret: (unsurely) Sure thing. (Past Margaret then brings in the food to past Mordecai and Rigby) Here's your food. The fries will be out in a minute.

Past Mordecai: Uh, are you feeling alright?

Past Margaret: Come on guys, if you're messing with me, it's not funny.

Past Mordecai: We're not! I swear!

Mordecai: Great. Now Margaret's mad at me.

Rigby: I guess you're just destined to ruin your chances with her.

Mordecai: I'm not giving up. There's got to be a way to fix my bad breath. I got it.

(The scene shows to a past Mordecai from this morning. He yawns and pick up a comb, but not the toothbrush, toothpaste or dental floss)

Past Mordecai: Awww yeah. That's what the ladies like.

(Suddenly, Mordecai and Rigby open the door. Mordecai holds to the past Mordecai)

Mordecai: Grab the mouthwash! (Rigby takes the mouthwash)

Past Mordecai: Rigby?! What?!

(Scene shows Rigby trying to open Past Mordecai's mouth)

Rigby: OPEN YOUR MOUTH!

Mordecai: It's for your own good!

(They get teleported back to the present)

Past Mordecai: What the heck?! Get off man!

Mordecai: Oh man...

Rigby: This can't be good.

Past Mordecai: Wait. Who are you guys?

Mordecai: We're from the future.

Past Mordecai: Oh no. Where am I? What year is this?

Rigby: Relax, it's the same day, just later at night.

Past Mordecai: Well, take me back. I don't want to cease to exist or something.

Mordecai: Wait, if we remove me from the past, does that mean I'm gonna disappear?

Rigby: I don't know. I'm not an expert on time travel! Just tell him what's up?

Mordecai: Okay, look, we finally kiss Margaret tonight.

Past Mordecai: What? No way.

Mordecai: No really, but it's bad. We had bad breath, and she pushed us away, and it was really embarrassing. So Rigby and I, were traveling back in time to fix it.

Past Mordecai: Wait, don't tell me your actually trying to use that "time machine" Rigby was scamming to buy.

Rigby: It wasn't a scam, it really works.

Past Mordecai: Whatever. All I know is guys from the future lie. Remember that lip syncing fiasco?

Mordecai: But this is different.

Past Mordecai: And what's this "we" kiss Margaret business? I haven't kissed Margaret yet. Just because you messed up, doesn't mean I'm gonna.

Mordecai: Dude, that's not how it works.

Past Mordecai: No dude, just stop trying to block my lip-lock. Gimme that piece of junk! (Grabs the time machine)

Mordecai: Wait!

Rigby: Don't worry. He's not gonna figure out how to use it.

Past Mordecai: Take me back to this morning. (Teleports back to his present)

Rigby: Well, I guess he's smarter than you somehow.

Mordecai: Agh, great. Well that's it then. We lost the time machine. I can't believe I have to live with this kiss.

Rigby: Never say never, man.

Mordecai: I didn't say never.

Rigby: Who's your best friend?

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

Rigby: (runs to the closet, and reveals to have another time machine.) Ba-ba-ba bam!

Mordecai: What, how?

Rigby: Dude, remember when I sent myself back two months ago? You thought I was fooling around, but I went back and bought a second time machine!

Mordecai: Rigby, you're a genius!

Rigby: Yeah, I saved three bucks with the double order.

Mordecai: All right, come on. We got to stop me before it's too late. Back to this morning.

(They get teleported to this morning. They found Past Mordecai but he runs away. Mordecai and Rigby go to places related with other episodes of Regular Show like "Camping Can Be Cool", "Ello Gov'nor", "Grave Sights", "Mordecai and the Rigbys", and "Just Set Up the Chairs")

Rigby: Dude! Stop! We're trying to help you!

Past Mordecai: Yeah right. You can't keep me from kissing Margaret.

Mordecai: Whatever dude, It's not like your never figure out I kissed her in the car at 11:55.

Rigby: Dude, what are you doing?

Mordecai: (To Rigby) I have a plan. (Sarcastic) Shoot, I can't believe I just gave that away. I'm such an idiot.

Past Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. 11:55! (gets teleported at the time of the kiss, and kidnaps his 11:55 self)

Past Mordecai 2: Hey! (Past Mordecai drags his 11:55 self to the bushes, ties him up, and gags him while Past Mordecai gets in the car.)

Past Mordecai: Hey sorry man, but you ain't getting my kiss tonight.(Mordecai opens the door.) Oh, hey Margaret, what's up? Aah! Just stay away from me! (Rigby grabs him)

Mordecai: Okay Rigby quick, go back to the present, and remember to destroy the Time machine.

Rigby: Yeah, fine. But you owe me 27 bucks. Well, you will owe me I guess. Back to the present. (Rigby and Past Mordecai are teleported to the present, Rigby and Mordecai destroy the Time machines and the Past Mordecai disappears. Mordecai gets inside the car, then Margaret comes in.)

Margaret: What's up?

Mordecai: I, uh, I can't find my wallet.

Margaret: Oh, let's see...(She also joins Mordecai in the car, helping him look for his wallet, then she leans over his seat) Did you check the glove compartment?

Mordecai: Yeah I checked there...(They realize that they are close to one another once again) already.

Margaret: Oh, ha.....

Mordecai: Ha. (They stare at each other, Mordecai gulps, and Margaret leans in to kiss Mordecai, but Mordecai then he realizes he forgot to take a mint, so he wusses out by finding his wallet) Oh, found it. Ha-ha.

Margaret: Oh, great. That's great. I'm glad you--

Mordecai: So, anyway do you-- (Mordecai and Margaret laugh) What to head inside?

Margaret: Sure.

Mordecai: Who's ready for Morde-shakes?

Rigby: Yeah, took you long enough.

Mordecai: You have no idea. Come on.

Rigby: You know, I came up with the name Morde-shakes.

Mordecai: Yeah-yeah.

(They head inside)

(Episode starts with Mordecai & Rigby playing a video game.)

Mordecai: Wooooooaaaahh! I beat the whole game without even taking a hit.

Rigby: I could have done that.

(Pops comes in)

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, hello! Would you two mind picking up a painting for me today?

Rigby: Yeah sure, that sounds fun.

Mordecai: What's the occasion, Pops?

Pops: Tonight's the Hall of Park Managers' annual celebration, (Shows the picture) and Benson is being honored.

Rigby: Wow, they have a hall for everything these days.

Pops: Hmph, yes, all the greatest park managers in the tri-county area have been represented there.

Mordecai: This sounds like kind of a big deal, are you sure you want us to do it?

Pops: Of course! I trust you. Benson's portrait is at the local gallery. (Shows another picture) Here is there information.

(Rigby grabs the information)

Mordecai: We won't let you down, Pops.

Pops: See you at the celebration. (Starts running, laughing, and throwing all the papers)

Mordecai & Rigby: Picking up a portrait!

(We skip the scene to see Gallery Chic. The camera zooms in to see the lady about to close the door)

Mordecai: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! (Takes a deep breath) Hi. Sorry we're late, we're here to pick up a painting.

Paint Manager: I was wondering when you'd show up.

(We skip to Mordecai and Rigby walking back to the house. Mordecai is carrying Benson's portrait while Rigby is carrying a hot pretzel.)

Rigby: So, no one's seen this painting yet?

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: You know, we could see this painting yet.

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: Aw, come on! You went to art school. Don't you want to see Benson, like, interpreted or look at the paint... composition?

Mordecai: Well, I guess that could be kinda cool.

Rigby: (Goes to rip open the painting's protective wrapping paper) Sweet! Let's rip her open.

Mordecai: Whoa, dude. You're not going near it with that pretzel.

Rigby: My hands are clean. Check it out. One finger holds the pretzel while the others do what I want. See, that's why pretzels are the perfect food. They got handles.

(The pretzel slips out of Rigby's hand and slides down Benson's exposed portrait, to which Rigby gasps)

Mordecai: Oh no, dude. Oh no, dude! OH NO, DUDE! Wipe it off!

(Rigby tries to wipe it off, which only makes a bigger mess)

Mordecai & Rigby: Aaah!

Rigby: We just ruined Benson's face for Benson's face thing!

Mordecai: We're fired. That's it! We're fired!

Rigby: You're the art guy. Make us not fired!

Mordecai: Okay. The party's in seven hours. (Begins to think of a plan) Hmm. Hmm. Hmmmmmm. Hmm, hmm. Yup. I'm going to repaint this thing.

Rigby: Sweet! Let's get this arty started!

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOOOOOOH!!

(The scene transitions back to the park house. Mordecai grabs a box labelled 'Mordo's art stuff' and coughs. He then sets up a canvas and tries to decide how he wants to paint Benson's portrait.)

Mordecai: Okay, Benson. Benson. Okay... Benson.

Rigby: Ugh! Come on, just start already!

Mordecai: I'm trying!

Rigby: When was the last time you actually drew something?

Mordecai: It's a process, man. In art school they taught us to really explore the subject and take time to really understand the deeper meaning.

(Rigby makes an obnoxious fart noise in response)

Rigby: Come on, this is Benson. It's not hard. Move. (He begins to paint on the blank canvas) Watch. He's round, angry, red... big ol' face. Whatever, done. Perfect. (A sloppily-drawn Benson is revealed)

Mordecai: Dude, that's way worse.

Rigby: At least I did something.

Mordecai: Augh. I just can't concentrate with you here watching me.

Rigby: Fine, but you better have something done when I get back. (He goes to leave)

Mordecai: I will! Once I, like, get the lights right, and the paint's gotta set... wait for the gesso to dry...

(Rigby slams the storm doors on his way out)

Mordecai: Alright. (Claps his hands) Time to get to business. (Claps again) Just gotta... (Fiddles with a radio) pick the right tunage. 

(We then skip to much later in the day. Rigby returns with a hot pretzel)

Rigby: So, how's it going?

Mordecai: Dude, another hot pretzel?

Rigby: Of course another hot pretzel. This is who I am, now. Deal with it. (Eats the pretzel) Alright, let me have a look.

Mordecai: Uh, naw. (Quickly blocks the painting) It's not ready yet.

Rigby: Come on, I wanna see! (Pulls Mordecai out of the way)

Mordecai: It's a work in progress. 

(The camera zooms in to the same creepy-drawn painting from before)

Rigby: Dude, you literally haven't done anything!

Mordecai: I said it's a work in progress!

Rigby: (Sighs) Seriously, Mordecai, what's the hold up? Hungry? Thirsty? Didn't graduate and are a huge loser?

Mordecai: (Groans) No, it's not that.

Rigby: Well, what is it, then?

Mordecai: It's just... uhh... (Rigby motions for him to continue) Alright, look. Whenever I drew portraits in college, they always went badly. They'd always misinterpret it, or get offended, and it was just tough because... ugh, whatever. I just can't do portraits.

Rigby: It's okay, dude. I'm sure you can conquer your fear. You really want to let down that face? (Rigby gestures to his sloppy drawing of Benson, and Mordecai laughs) I believe in ya, man.

Mordecai: Alright, I'm gonna try a trick that always worked in art school. (He puts a tape on. The words 'Painting is Great with Benny Harris' appear.)

Benny: Oh. Hey there, fellow painters, Benny Harris here. And today I'll be showing you how to make some beautiful little portraits. 

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai finally attempting to paint Benson's portrait)

Benny: And sometimes, we just gotta take our accidents and make them a little more chipper. Cheer up there, little moustache! Now that's a pleasant little mustache we just painted.

Mordecai: Hmm. Hmm, hmm.

Benny: And do you know why?

Mordecai: Mm-mm.

Benny: Cause I pictured it in my mind's eye. (The hedgehog on his shoulder chirps in response, and he laughs) Penelope sure does love it when I get existential.

Mordecai: Mind's eye. (Sighs)

(Mordecai then has a flashback of when he was still in art school. A young woman comes up to him.)

Woman: Hey! (Mordecai looks up) So you're, like, an artist?

Mordecai: Yeah. I mean, I'm in art school, so... (Laughs)

Woman: So, could you, like, draw me?

Mordecai: Oh, yeah, sure. (Quickly draws her and shows her the picture. As soon as the woman sees it, she runs away crying. Mordecai groans loudly in response.)

(The scene then cuts back to the present, where Mordecai is groaning in the exact same manner)

Benny: Relax. The human mind can be a spooky place full of all your fears, memories, and secrets. Focus on that there subject.

Mordecai: Okay, okay.

(We then get another glimpse into Mordecai's mind, where he is still picturing the girl crying. He groans in concentration and he is able to replace the crying woman with Benson.)

Benson: Hi, I'm Benson. Your boss, former drummer, stick hockey enthusiast.

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah. Yeah! (He begins to paint, only to create a cubist painting) Uh, ooooh.

(The camera then pans over to Skips and Benson, who are talking outside)

Skips: Benson, you excited for the party tonight?

Benson: Yeah! It feels really good to be given this huge honor. I can't wait.

(Rigby walks in)

Rigby: Hey man, how's it going? I assume everything's aweso-ooooooh!

Mordecai: Ugh. This is horrible. I can't show this to Benson. (He then hears Benny say something and turns his attention to the TV)

Benny: Now I know our mind's eye can sometimes get a little messy. When my thoughts get clogged up, I find taking some slides really inspires my creative flow.

Mordecai: Dude, that's it! I just need some reference.

(Rigby pulls out a camera)

Rigby: I'm on it! (He runs outside)

(We then cut back to Benson and Skips talking)

Benson: Yeah, I mean, Audrey and I aren't really calling it a date... (Rigby starts taking pictures) Rigby, what are you doing? Stop! Stop it! Get out of my face with that camera or you're fired! (Rigby stops taking pictures and rushes back to Mordecai)

Rigby: Alright, let's go get these babies developed.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai and Rigby back at the park)

Rigby: Okay, let's see what we got here. (Turns on a projector and flips through all the photos he took) Nice. Cool. Woah!

Mordecai: Rigby, I can't use any of these.

Rigby: He moves around a lot, got all that nervous energy.

Mordecai: Augh! 

Rigby: Come on, you got all you need here! (Flips through the photos again) His face, hands, feet, that's his, you know, his butt, that's an important element.

Mordecai: (Sighs) Yeah. I guess I can piece it together. (Starts painting)

Rigby: You're doing it!

Mordecai: Dude, don't jinx it. (Goes back to painting)

(Rigby's phone suddenly rings)

Rigby: Hey, Pops.

Pops: Yes, hello, Rigby. It's Pops, your friend Pops from the park. Say, I must ask, where's the portrait? We're all waiting.

Rigby: Oh, it's going great, gonna be great, everyone's gonna love it! (Mordecai tries to silence Rigby with hand motions) I think the artists really had some breakthroughs. Get your hopes way, way up! We'll be there soon, very soon. (He hangs up)

Mordecai: Dude, why'd you say all that?

Rigby: It's true, right? You gotta be done by now.

Mordecai: No, I still gotta fix the-

Rigby: There's no time! I'm sure it's fine!

Mordecai: Seriously, it's not ready yet. And keep that stupid pretzel away from it!

Rigby: I'm sorry, but seriously, we have to go now!

Mordecai: But they're gonna hate it! No! (He ends up pushing Rigby, whose hot pretzel sauce ends up getting all over the projector)

Rigby: Hmm. Something weird normally happens when that happens. (He then slips and spills his cheese sauce on the projector) Oh no, my dipping sauce!

(Mordecai and Rigby are seen coughing as something emerges from the projector)

Mordecai: What is that? (More objects begin to emerge) Dude, are those your horrible slides? 

(A Benson slide then leaps up and latches onto a pipe)

Benson Butt Slide: We're horrible? You call this art? (He shows Mordecai his painting)

Mordecai: What do you mean?

Benson Butt Slide: This portrait looks nothing like me!

Mordecai: Yeah it does! I mean, kinda.

Benson Butt Slide: You've ruined everything!

Benson Face Slide: Destroy the painting!

(Another Benson slide begins to climb up Mordecai's leg)

Mordecai: Aaah!

(Rigby begins hitting the Benson slides with Mordecai's painting)

Rigby: No! Mordecai is good at art! (A Benson slide goes through a paper shredder)

Benson Face Slide: Rigby's not an artist! You can't trust his opinion!

Mordecai: He's my friend! (Kicks the slide)

Benson Face Slide: Exactly! (Crawls back over towards Mordecai)

(Rigby is shown running away with the painting)

Benson Butt Slide: Give me that cubic trash! (Rigby screams and flings the slide, which lands back on top of him) 

Rigby: Mordecai, there's no time! We have to get to the party!

(Mordecai grabs a pipe and uses it to remove the Benson slide from his leg)

Rigby: Their punches are like papercuts!

(Three Benson slides attack Rigby. Mordecai goes to get rid of them, but another slide jumps onto the pipe he's holding.)

Benson Big Hand Slide: You're just another slacker that went to art school to feel like he accomplished something!

(Mordecai flings the slide into the TV, which activates Benny Harris's ghost)

Mordecai & Rigby: Benny Harris!

Benny: Well, hey there!

Mordecai: What should we do?

Benny: I always say use what you see in your mind's eye.

Mordecai: (Kicks a Benson slide) Dude, that didn't work!

Benny: Who cares? What's more important is that you made something. That's more than most people can say. Look at that guy. He probably never made anything in his life.

Rigby: Hey! (A Benson slide punches him in the face)

Mordecai: But the painting's all wrong! I messed it up! Now Benson's night is gonna be ruined.

Benny: Well, sometimes we gotta take our accidents and make them a little more chipper. (Holds up a paintbrush)

Mordecai: But how does that stop the Bensons?

Benny: Ugh, just paint over them. They're slides!

Mordecai: Oh, cool. (Walks over to a can of paint)

Benson Blob Slide: Might as well just give up now. You couldn't use a paintbrush to save your life!

Mordecai: Well then I won't use a paintbrush. (He dunks his fist in the paint can)

(He throws a ball of paint at the slide, which eliminates it. Rigby gasps in admiration. Mordecai then punches another slide, which sends paint flying onto the canvas. The shredded Benson slide climbs onto Rigby, who dives into another can of paint. He shakes the paint off like a dog and eliminates another Benson slide that is crawling towards him.)

Benson Butt Slide: You're making a mess! Clean it up or you're fired!

(Mordecai throws Rigby at the slide, which then ultimately ends up eliminating it when Rigby rams into the projector screen. Benny whistles in awe.)

Rigby: We did it!

Mordecai: Thanks for your help, Benny Harris's ghost, or hologram, or astral projection, or whatever.

Benny: No problamo! Don't be a stranger now, and remember to rewiiiiiiind! (He gets sucked back into the tape)

Mordecai: How does it look? (Rigby shows him the painting) Uhhh.... wait. Help me flip it over. Good enough. Let's roll.

(We skip to the Hall of Park Managers)

 Host: And now, we welcome our newest member! Mr. Pops, would you please present the portrait?

(Pops murmurs nervously)

Benson: You didn't have Mordecai and Rigby do it, did you? 

Pops: Well...

(Mordecai and Rigby burst through the doors. Everyone gasps in shock.)

Host: Who are those two? This is most unusual.

Mordecai: We brought the painting. And... we're sorry. We messed it up. (Benson turns red) But I tried to... well, I hope you like it anyway. Sorry if it isn't what you wanted. (Rigby unveils it, and everyone complains. Benson and Pops gasp in shock.) Uh... dude, flip it over! (Rigby flips it over, and everyone in the audience starts to applaude) I understand if you want to fire me.

Benson: Fire you? I think it's great! The brush work, the composition, the raw energy perfectly captured my misunderstood personality. You're actually a really great artist, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Thanks.

Host: Uh yes, yes, I love it too. But I'm sorry; this abstract, unconventional piece just isn't appropriate for a hall setting. We'll have to commission a new portrait.

Rigby: You're not even going to use Mordecai's cool one?

Benson: That's okay. I know just the place for it.

(We cut back to the park house, where Benson is writing something at his desk. The painting is hanging behind him. Suddenly, it falls down, and Benson sighs.)

Benson: Why did I have Mordecai and Rigby hang it?

(End of Bad Portrait)


(Episode starts with Muscle Man getting a haircut at a barber shop called Cheap Cuts)

Muscle Man: Not too much off the top, Tony. Everything's got to be perfect. Tonight's my one-year anniversary with Starla.

Tony: Where you guys headed?

Muscle Man: A bunch of us are gonna get our skate on at the roller rink. That's why I'm getting my hair cut and everything.

Tony: Sounds like a big deal.

Muscle Man: Yeah, but I've got it all figured out, though. I pre-requested the deejay to play our song at the end of the night.

Tony: Oh, boy, she's gonna love that. (He blow dries Muscle Man's hair)

Muscle Man: Yeah, I know.

(Tony wipes off Muscle Man's chin)

Tony: All right. You're all done.

Muscle Man: Thanks, Tony.

Tony: Don't mention it. You look great, kid.

(Tony hands over a mirror, and Muscle Man sees a bald spot on the back of his head. He is in shock as he runs outside.)

Hi Five Ghost: Muscle Man, what's the matter?!

Muscle Man: What do you think's the matter? I'm bald! (He shows Hi Five Ghost the bald patch on his head)

Hi Five Ghost: Whoa!

Muscle Man: I can't let Starla see me like this!

Hi Five Ghost: It's not that bad.

Muscle Man: Yes it is! If she sees me bald, she's gonna dump me! I just have to figure out a way to keep Starla from finding out that I'm bald.

(Muscle Man goes into Benson's office, while wearing a 'It's Party Time' Sombrero)

Benson: No, no, no, no, no.

Muscle Man: What?

Benson: It's not party time. It's work time. Get rid of the hat.

Muscle Man: Aw, come on, Benson!

Benson: You know the rules. No oversized novelty hats on work time.

Muscle Man: Fine!

(Throws his hat on the ground, and Benson sees his bald spot)

Benson: Whoa.

Muscle Man: Is it that noticeable?

Benson: Yes. But don't worry. Lots of guys are bald and they're really cool. (Happily) I mean, look at me!

Muscle Man: Come on, Benson, just give me back the hat!

Benson: Sorry, Muscle Man, but you know the rules. (He shreds the Sombrero in the shredder)

Muscle Man: Ugh! (He hits the wall with his right fist, and leaves)

Benson: Punching the wall isn't gonna grow it back! I already tried.

(Muscle Man is seen with a comb-over and runs into Skips)

Skips: You're not fooling anyone.

Muscle Man: What are you talking about?

Skips: Your comb-over.

Muscle Man: Aw, MAN!

(Frustrated, he forcefully puts down his trolley full of dirt)

Muscle Man (continued): How can you tell?!

(Skips shows Muscle Man his bald spot) 

Muscle Man (continued): Whoa.

Skips: It's all right. You get used to it.

Muscle Man: Really?

Skips: Yeah, in about 400 years.

(Muscle Man freaks out and runs away)

(Next scene. Muscle Man sprays on 'Not So Bald' Hair spray to cover up his bald spot.)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man. You ready to get your skate on tonight?

Muscle Man: You know it, bro. 

(The hairspray melts on his face)

Muscle Man (continued):  I'm gonna show all you fools how it's done!

Rigby: What's wrong with your hair, dude?

Muscle Man: What?

(He touches the top of his head, and the hair spray gets all over his fingers) 

Muscle Man (continued): (Angrily) Man! This stuff was expensive!

Rigby: Whoa. I didn't know you were bald.

(Muscle Man freaks out and rolls away)

Mordecai: Uh, see you tonight, Muscle Man.

(Scene changes to Muscle Man's trailer. Sad music can be heard in the background.)

Muscle Man: I guess I'm gonna have to tell Starla the truth.

(Scene cuts to Muscle Man's imagination, where we see Starla in a pitch black background)

Starla: Mitch, where are you?

Muscle Man: Happy one-year anniversary, baby. 

(He gives Starla a rose)

Starla: Oh, Mitch! Thank you.

Muscle Man: Starla, I have to tell you something. I'm... bald.

(Starla laughs)

Muscle Man (continued): (Nervously) Why are you laughing, babe?

Starla: How could you possibly think I'd love a bald man?

(She begins to laugh, along with Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Skips. A random, attractive guy with flowing, long hair appears at her side.)

Muscle Man: Who's that, babe?

Starla: He's my new boyfriend. (Aggressive tone) He's not bald.

Muscle Man: No!

Starla: (On phone) Police! Arrest my ex. He's bald!

Muscle Man: What? No, babe! 

(The police grab Muscle Man)

Muscle Man (continued): Noooooooooo!

(Imagination scene ends. Muscle Man sees a mirror and angrily breaks it with a chair.)

Hi Five Ghost: Hey, that's my mirror!

Muscle Man: (Shaking High Five Ghost) What am I gonna do, Fives?!

Hi Five Ghost: Geez, relax! Starla's not gonna care, man.

Muscle Man: Are you kidding?! The only things I have going for me are my flowing mane and my rippling muscles.

Hi Five Ghost: Well, at least you still got your muscles.

Muscle Man: Yeah, I guess that's true.

(He takes off his shirt and flexes his pecs. Both him and Hi Five Ghost look in the mirror.)

Muscle Man (continued): Man, you remember last summer at the water park? I had to stop flexing 'cause Starla couldn't keep her hands off me. Whoa, whoa, I just thought of something.

Hi Five Ghost: What?

Muscle Man: If I keep flexing these babies, then maybe Starla won't notice I'm bald!

Hi Five Ghost: Oh, yeah, that could work.

Muscle Man: Dude!

Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost: Flex the pecs! Hoo!

(They high five)

(Scene changes to skating rink. We see a couple of random people skating, as well as Mordecai skating with Margaret.)

Mordecai: Did you see that? I bet I could do that.

Margaret: Yeah, in your dreams.

Eileen: (Grabbing Rigby) Come on, Rigby. It'll be fun!

(Rigby whimpers and holds onto the rail at the side)

Starla: (Skates up to Hi Five Ghost) Hey, Fives, have you seen Mitch?

Hi Five Ghost: He should be here by now.

(Muscle Man comes out of the bathroom with a rose in his mouth, his pecs flexing all the while)

Mordecai: Dude, why does Muscle Man keep flexing his pecs like that?

Margaret: I don't know, it's gross! But oddly hypnotic... 

(Mordecai looks at Margaret suspiciously)

Muscle Man: Happy anniversary, baby.

Starla: Oh, Mitch, you're such a charmer.

(Muscle Man and Starla start skating)

Starla: (Laughs) Mitch, will you lift me?

Muscle Man: Uh, sure, babe.

Starla: (Laughs again after he lifts her up) Mitch.

Muscle Man: (Laughs as his eye twitches) Starla.

Starla: Hey, babe, are you all right?

Muscle Man: Yeah, why wouldn't I be all right?

Starla: Well, you look a little tired.

Muscle Man: What? No, I don't. I look normal. See? (He makes a weird face and tries to stop his pecs from flexing) Hang on. (He lets go of Starla)

Starla: Hey, where you going?

Muscle Man : (Backs out of the rink) I got to use it!

(Muscle Man continues to back out into the restroom. He goes into one of the stalls, sits down and groans.)

Muscle Man (continued): My pecs are killing me. But it's only a little longer till they play our song. I just have to make it through that song! (He starts straining himself, and fails. He takes a deep breath and tries again.) Come on! (He starts flexing his pecs again.) Come on! Do it for her! STARLA!

(Cut to Fives socializing with a girl.)

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, I liked their first album.

(Starla skates over to them.)

Starla: Fives, could you check on Mitch? He's been in the bathroom for a while.

Hi Five Ghost: Sure. (Fives goes inside the bathroom, which looks a lot brighter than before.) Whoa.

Muscle Man: Who is that?! Get out of here!

Hi Five Ghost: Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: Fives? Is that you?

Hi Five Ghost: Are you okay?

Muscle Man: Don't come in here, bro!

(Fives opens the stall, and Muscle Man's pecs are shown to be flexing brightly and uncontrollably.)

Hi Five Ghost: (gasps) Dude, what happened?!

Muscle Man: I was trying to keep flexing, so I started punching and slapping them and stuff, and now they're going crazy! They won't stop!

Hi Five Ghost: Well, dude, Starla's looking for you!

Muscle Man: I can't go back out there, Fives!

DJ: All right, boys and girls, it's your last chance to grab that special someone because it's the last song of the night!

Muscle Man: Oh, no! That's the song I requested!

Hi Five Ghost: If you don't get out there and skate with Starla, it'll ruin your whole anniversary!

(Muscle Man skates out of the bathroom. Starla turns her attention to him, and he salutes to the DJ, who nods. Muscle Man and Starla meet up.)

Starla: Mitch! You remembered our song.

(She catches sight of Muscle Man's pecs and stares at them.)

Muscle Man: How could I ever forget? You're the best thing that ever skated into my life.

(They both skate into the rink, past some skaters. The female skaters see Muscle Man's pecs and become hypnotized. They begin to skate toward him. Muscle Man and Starla continue to skate past more people. The females become hypnotized and skate toward them, leaving behind the males.)

Guy #1: Hey, where you going, ladies?

Guy #2: They just ditched us for that loser!

(All the girl skaters are now skating a distance from Muscle Man and Starla. They soon get close, grab Starla, and throw her aside. They scream excitedly at Muscle Man.)

Starla: Huh?

(Muscle Man is now crowded by all the female skaters in the rink. He tries to push himself out.)

Muscle Man: Get off of me!

(Starla is enraged.)

Starla: Aaah! Get your hands off my man!

(She begins skating to the crowd, fighting her way through to Muscle Man. The three guys skate to him also.)

Guy #2: Let's get our chicks back!

(The third guy punches Muscle Man in the face, and pushes him over to the other guys, who surround him.)

Guy #2: If you think you can take our girlfriends, you got another thing coming!

(The third guy grabs him while the second guy punches him.)

Muscle Man: I didn't take your girls!

(He frees himself from the third guy's grasp and punches the second guy in the face. The first guy punches Muscle Man down.)

Guy #2: Hold him still.

(The third guy hooks him by the shoulders.)

Muscle Man: Let go, bro!

Guy #2: Let's see how strong those muscles really are!

(He tries to punch him in one of the pecs, but it is spinning so rapidly that it slices off his hand causing him to scream. One of the other guys try to punch Muscle Man, but he blocks it and punches him down. He then kicks the oncoming third guy down with his skates. The first guy trips over him while charging at Muscle Man, causing his face to hit against his pecs and burn. He drops down clutching it.)

Guy #1: Oh, man! You burned my face!

(A girl grabs onto Muscle Man and screams.)

Girl: Aah! I love you!

(Starla skates over to her.)

Starla: Get off of him!

(She throws her aside to the other girl skaters.)

Girl Skaters: Muscle Man!

(The girl crashes into them. Another girl skater races to Muscle Man, but Starla holds her back. She turns to Muscle Man.)

Starla: Mitch, why do you keep flexing your pecs?

Muscle Man: I... (gets grabbed by a guy skater) don't... know what you're talking about!

(Starla smashes the skater down.)

Starla: You're being weird!

Muscle Man: No! You're being weird!

(He flips the guy from behind and punches him.)

Starla: Oh, whatever! That's just what you say when you're being weird!

(She keeps fighting the other girl skaters.)

Muscle Man: I'm not being weird!

(A boy skater smacks Muscle Man in the face with a guitar.)

Muscle Man (continued): Hey, watch the hair!

Starla: Mitch, don't you lie to me! Are you flexing your pecs because you want the other girls to notice you?

Muscle Man: No way, babe!

(The skater kicks him, then Muscle Man punches him and jumps on him.)

Boy skater: Aah!

Starla: Are you trying to break up with me?

Muscle Man: No!

(The skaters grab him by the arms.)

Starla: You are, aren't you?!

Muscle Man: No, I'm not!

Starla: Yes, you are! You're trying to break up with ME-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E!

(As she holds that word, it causes a guy's cup to break and a guy's head to burst.)

Muscle Man: Baby, no! You're the only one I love!

Starla: You're lying!

Muscle Man: No, I'm not! I can't stop flexing my pecs, okay?!

Starla: What? Why not?

Muscle Man: I can't stop flexing my pecs because...

Starla: Because what, Mitch?

Muscle Man: Because... I- I...

(He strains a bit.)

Starla: If you don't tell me right now, I'm gonna walk right out that door.

Muscle Man: I can't stop flexing because... I didn't want you to know that I'm bald!

(He bends his head down, revealing the bald spot. He stops flexing. A spotlight shines on Muscle Man, and the record is scratched by the DJ. All the girls who were stunned go back to normal. The skater guys let go of him.)

Guy #1: You make me sick, baldy. Sick!

(The skater guys go away. The girls skaters are sickened and leave the rink as well.)

Girl #2: I can't believe he's bald.

(Starla skates over to Muscle Man.)

Muscle Man: You hate me now, don't you?

Starla: Aw, Mitch. I don't care that you have a bald spot. It happens to a lot of guys.

Muscle Man: So? I still look like an animal. A disgusting, middle-aged-looking animal.

Starla: It's okay, Mitch. It's what's inside this disgusting, middle-aged-looking animal that counts.

(She looks at the bald spot and laughs.)

Muscle Man: What?

(She feels the bald spot.)

Starla: There's stubble on your head. You're not going bald. You just got a bad haircut.

Muscle Man: That's why I love you, baby.

(The two start making out, the friends watching.)

Mordecai: Uh, so I guess we'll catch you guys later or something?

(They leave the two alone.)

(Episode opens with Wing Kingdom. Rigby prepares to make a shot and succeeds.)

Rigby: Oh, the pressure is on! Will Skips sink a triple bank to top the shot or will Rigby remain undefeated?

(Skips shoots and he misses)

Skips: Aw, nuts.

Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, and Mordecai: OOOHHHH!

Rigby: (Grabs the basketball) All Rigby needs is one simple bank shot and this deal is done dotta. (He prepares to shot) What's his gut tell him? (Goes to his stomach and back up to his face) Says it's gonna be a good one.

(Rigby shoots and succeeds again)

Rigby: Aw yeah! Year of the Rigbyyyyyyy! (Rotates his hat on his head) Who else wants to play against the masta?

Muscle Man: No way, bro. I'd rather play a game I might actually win.

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. How are you so good at this game?

Rigby: You guys are just overthinking it. Now, who wants to step it to the king?

Cash Bankis: I do.

(Steps out of his booth)

Two Guys: Cash Bankis!

(Cash walks over to the guys)

Rigby: Uh, what was that? You said you want to bank some shots?

Cash Bankis: You talk a lot of talk kid. You wanna prove you're the man? Then how about a little wager?

Rigby: What do you want to bet?

Cash Bankis: Loser pays for the winner's bill.

Mordecai: Rigby, wait. This guy's weird. I don't trust him.

Rigby: Don't trust him? His name's Cash; he can afford to pay our meal.

Mordecai: That's not why I don't trust-

Rigby: I accept.

(Cash removes his hood, revealing him having a basketball hoop for a head. The guys gasp)

Cash Bankis: Tank, ball bag me.

(Tank gives Cash a bag and removes a basketball with the word "Bankis" made of crystals on it)

Rigby: I'll let you go first, 'cause no matter what you do, it's gonna be easy for me to top-

(Cash shoots and succeds; the guys gasp)

Rigby: -it. Pfft. That shot was alright, but this shot's even better!

(Rigby shoots and misses)

Rigby: What? My gut never lets me down.

(Cash shoots and succeeds again)

Cash Bankis: The bill.

(Gives the bill to Rigby)

Rigby: $12,000?! What have you been eating?

Cash Bankis: Me and the boys been eating gold-plated chicken all night.

(Goes to the booth with the others eating gold chicken)

Guy: This gold really holds in the moisture.

Rigby: Double or nothing!

Mordecai: Rigby, don't!

Rigby: I bet double or nothing that I can bank it off the far wall and into the hoop.

Cash Bankis: Throw in that hat as a side bet and you got a deal.

Rigby: What? But I almost died for this hat!

Cash Bankis: It's the one thing money can't buy, and it's the only deal I'll take.

Mordecai: Dude, don't do it. You can't make a shot off the wall!

Rigby: Yes I can; I can feel it in my gut. I've never felt so sure of any bank shot in my entire life!

(Rigby prepares to shot)

Rigby: Talk to me, gut.

(Rigby makes sure his shot will work)

Rigby: Hmm. Greatest bank shot of all time!

(Rigby throws the ball and it goes through the window and makes a car crash)

Rigby: But it should've worked.

Cash Bankis: (Takes Rigby's hat and puts it on his head) I'll take that. Perfect fit, now pay up loser.

Rigby: I don't have that kind of money!

Cash Bankis: Then you shouldn't made that kind of bet. If you don't have it, maybe your pals here do.

(Mordecai, Skips, Muscle Man, and Hi Five Ghost all murmur nervously and back up into Cash's friends)

Rigby: Wait, wait. I want another rematch. Triple or nothing.

Cash Bankis: Triple or nothing huh? I accept.

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing?! We don't have 36 grand!

Rigby: I don't care how much it is, 'cause I'm not gonna lose! Let's go!

Cash Bankis: You are on.

Mordecai: Hold on; give us a couple a days. Rigby needs to brush up on his skills. (Gets in Rigby's face) Don't you, Rigby?

Cash Bankis: Fine, fine. You got till tomorrow. (Spins the basketball on his finger) But if you lose, we get the money, (Catches ball) and none of you can ever show your faces in Wing Kingdom ever again.

(Muscle Man squeal-screams)

Cash Bankis: See ya tomorrow, friend.

(Cash Bankis and his friends laugh and walk away)

Mordecai: Way to rope us into your mess.

Skips: I don't know you.

Muscle Man: If my future at Wing Kingdom is at stake because of you, that 36 thousand dollars will be the LEAST of your problems.

Rigby: I gotta win this game.

(Scene goes to Rigby finishing the basketball hoop)

Rigby: That should do it. (gets ready to practice) Man, I can't believe my gut was wrong. Maybe it's time to rely on my brain instead. (throws ball but it misses) Alright, no more fooling around! (throws ball again, and it misses again) Ah, what?! (grabs ball and throws it furiously, making it crash everywhere and into Benson's office window)

Benson: (from inside) Oh, come on! Are you kidding me?!

Rigby: (sighs) I need help. (scene cuts to hallway. Rigby is looking at a picture of his friends.) I really messed this up for everyone. (we see Rigby's friends standing there. They all give him a glare and walk away. Rigby sighs) Guess there's only one person who can help me now..(calls a number) Hey, can you come over? I need your help.

(Scene cuts to Rigby sitting on the stairs waiting for someone. A familiar looking car pull up to the house Don comes out)

Don: Rigbone! How's my big bro?

Rigby: Thanks for coming, Don.

Don: Man, it's been a while. You look good. Gotta say I'm a little surprised you called me. What's up?

Rigby: I'm in a lotta trouble, Don. There's these guys--

Don: Oh, hey! Bank shot! (walk up to it) I haven't seen one of these since we were kids. (performs a perfect bank shot) Whoo! Good times. So, uh, what's the problem?

Rigby: I ran my mouth off to the wrong guys and now I'm in trouble. I gotta win a bank shot match. All my money's ridin' on it.

Don: But you're great at this.

Rigby: Not anymore! I lost my touch. You're the only guy I know who's better at this than me. You gotta help me out.

Don: Well, here. (passes the ball to Rigby) Show me what you got.

(Rigby shoot the ball, but it hits the hoop, bounces off Rigby's head, and goes through Benson's office window, which was supported with cardboard)

Benson: Oh, not again!

Don: I see, we've got a lot of work to do.

Rigby: Well, let's get started

Don: Wait. Lemme get my workout gear on. (puts on a headband) Alright, let's go!

(We are shown an montage of Rigby and Don practising bank shots.)

Rigby: How do you do it, man? You never miss!

Don: You're just overthinking it. I've seen you do bank shots I can't believe. You're just as good as me. Maybe even better. You've always trusted your gut ever since we were kids. Why stop now?

Rigby: I did trust my gut on that epic shot and I lost my trucker hat. My gut doesn't know anything. I can't rely on feelings. If I lose that rematch I'll let all my friends down.

Don: You won't lose, Rigby. I believe in you.

Rigby: Really?

Don: I know it right here.

Rigby: Thanks, man. (Goes to try again) Time to show that square-faced sucka who's boss! Wah-pow! (does an amazing bank shot into the hoop. Rigby's friends walk over to him, impressed.)

Hi Five Ghost: Woah!

Muscle Man: Yo, Rigby! That was a smooth move, bro!

Rigby: Yeah-yuh! Don helped me get back in the game! (Everyone greets Don)

Don: Hey, guys!

Rigby: Yeah! I'm gonna crush him!

Muscle Man: We're behind you all the way bro, win or lose.

Skips: But, you know, we'd prefer you win.

Rigby: Thanks, guys. I know I can do it.

Mordecai: Then let's get to that rematch so you can ice that fool.

(Cut to Rigby, Don and the guys heading back to Wing Kingdom. Cash and his friends are waiting for them.)

Cash Bankis: So you decided to show up. Good. I'm looking forward to that extra change. It's $36,000, right, Clarence? (Clarence shoots him a cool look)

Rigby: (grabs a banking ball) You can go first.

Cash Bankis: Great. Let's get this over with, 'cause I'm (shoots) hungry! (makes a shot, then chuckles) Looks like I'll be upgrading to (spins ball) diamond chicken.

(Rigby gets ready to make his shot. He fumbles a bit, but catches his ball. The guys chatter. Cash puts on Rigby's eggscellent hat.)

Rigby: No, I'm eggscellent! Huh! (He shoots and makes a shot.) Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm!

Cash Bankis: Hmm! (bounces the ball with his elbows and makes a shot.)

(Rigby kicks up the ball, then shoots it into the hoop off his head. Cash spins the ball and throws it off with a finger. The ball banks off four chairs and into the hoop. Rigby throws up the ball, catches it, and pounds it off the ground, sending it through the soft drink area where it gets covered with drink, and into the hoop again. Cash shoots; it bounces off a backboard and into the hoop. Rigby shoots, same result. Cash shoots again, same result. Rigby; same result. Cash makes a shot, Rigby makes a shot. Cash is now frustrated. He throws the ball off the wall, and it slides through the deer statues's antlers, off a fan, off the front table, hits a glass cup, and dives through the hoop. Everyone is shocked.)

Cash Bankis: Top that!

(Rigby prepares to make his next shot, with a worried look on his face. He throws the ball, and it bounces off the hoop, off the hanging plant, on the pool table, knocks off a trophy, hits a few backboards and back into the hoop. Everyone cheers.)

Rigby: (spins) OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH!

(Cash winces before making his next shot. The ball bounces off the hoop, off a broken lamp, around a big bowl of a couple's sundae, off a photo of The Wing King, and back to the hoop where it bounces between the two middle backboards. The two bankers are watching. The ball finally bounces off the rim of the hoop. Everyone except Cash cheers.)

Cash Bankis: Nooo!

Mordecai: One more shot and you win, Rigby!

(Rigby looks at Don before making his shot, and Don put his hand to his heart. Rigby smiles and nods with confidence. The audience cheers on for Rigby. Close up to his face, he closes his eyes and makes the shot. The ball bounces off the jukebox, shatters the 'Try Our Special Sauce' sign, goes through the restroom doors, around a toilet seat, back through the doors, off the wall, off the bottom right backboard, off the top left backboard, and finally, into the hoop! Everyone cheers as Rigby's friends run to him.)

Skips: I knew you could do it.

(Rigby, his brother and his friends walk up to Cash.)

Rigby: Looks like you'll be paying your own bill, Cash. Aaaaand, I'll take my hat back, please.

Cash Bankis: Oh, no. Uh-uh. You may not have to pay me that money, but I won this hat fair and square on that side bet! You'll never see it again.

Rigby: Aw, man, he's right. The hat's his.

???: Hold everything!

Rigby: Huh?

(Steam comes out from the bathroom doors, and a familar looking character comes out. Rigby, Don and his friends gasp.)

Mordecai: The God of Basketball?

God of Basketball: Rigby, your original 'Double or nothing' shot is still in play.

Rigby: The one that banked out the window? But how?

God of Basketball: It's my duty to keep track of all things basketball. And when your ball went out the window, it continued to bank!

(Flashback of Rigby's double or nothing shot. When his ball went out the window, it banked out a plant pot, and started banking down the path.)

God of Basketball: Huh? (sees  the banking ball and decidesto follow it)

(The banking ball goes down the path, through wheat fields, through the desert, past a farm with cows, through Peru, onto a plane where it banks in its seat while having coffee, off the plane and into another banking ball. They go banking with each other.The God of Basketball watch them mate and get "married". Rigby's banking ball decide to bank back to Wing Kingdom to win Rigby bet. The flashback ends)

Rigby: Does this mean my gut feeling was right this whole time? Is the shot gonna go in?

God of Basketball: I'm as curious as you. I arrived ahead of time so I could catch the final moment myself.

Mordecai: Wait. What's that sound?

(Banking can be heard in the background. Rigby's double or nothing ball returns through the cardboard window, off four seats, off the soft drink dispenser, off the plant, off the couple's sundae, through the bathroom doors, off a flusher, back through the double doors, sliding through the statue's antlers, off someone's plate of wings, and it bounces off Cash's head, knocking off the Eggscellent hat. After bounces off backboards numerous times, the ball goes round the rim of the hoop, and finally into the hoop! Everyone cheers.)

Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

God of Basketball: (picking up the Eggscellent hat) Rigby, you have truly made (puts the hat on Rigby) the greatest bank shot of all time!

(His friends cheers and pick him up.)

Rigby: Oh yeah! My shots are like the best part of the alphabet! L-M-N-

All: Oooooooo!

(The episode began outside at The Best Tailor in the World, where a black SUV drove and parked in front of the store. Two men in black suits and sunglasses came out of the SUV before one of them opened the door for a third man, named Rich Steve. He blew a bubble from some bubblegum and snapped his fingers to have his sunglasses taken off. When the first bodyguard took Steve's sunglasses off, he snapped his fingers to spit his gum out on something. The second bodyguard pulled out a $100 bill and handed it to Rich Steve, in which he spat his gum out on before the three men entered the tailor shop.)

Rich Steve: Shopkeep!

(He snapped his fingers again to catch the tailor's attention.)

Tailor: Oh! Uh, Mr. Rich Steve, you're early. I thought we'd agreed that- -

Rich Steve: Is it ready?

Tailor: Uh, yes sir. I put the finishing touches on it just this morning. (holds a remote) Behold!

(He pushed the button on the remote, which opened up a metal door in the ceiling before a black suit was being brought down on a wooden table by a metal claw.)

Tailor: Before you stands the greatest tailoring of all human history. Note the understated pinstriping, Brazilian Wandering Spider silk lining, and unprecedented two interior pockets. And of course, embedded military-graded weaponry, which allows the wearer to annihilate anything that stands in his way. (chuckles) I think you'll find that this suit is certain to grant you the unconditional respect of your peers.

Rich Steve: (rummages in his wallet) You've done well, my friend. And I treat my friends right.

(He stuck a bill in the tailor's shirt pocket, but when he took it out to observe the bill, it was only $10.)

Tailor: Um, sir... this is not the price we agreed upon.

Rich Steve: (annoyed) Listen pal, I didn't get stupid rich by (pokes the tailor's chest) paying people what I owed them.

Tailor: (points at the suit) This suit represents the apex of human ingenuity! (crosses his arms) If you won't pay what it's worth, I have many buyers who will!

Rich Steve: Ohh, big mistake. Guards!

(On command, the guards grabbed the tailor by the arms.)

Tailor: Aah! You're not worthy of my creation!

Rich Steve: Ain't nobody gonna wear this suit but me! Hold this. (gives dynamite to first guard) And this. (gives the button to the second guard) When my new suit and I are at a safe distance away, blow this guy to smithereens.

Second Guard: Uh... do we have to stay in here? Couldn't we just- -

Rich Steve: Shut it! I'm not paying you to not blow yourselves up!

(Then, with the new suit in his hands, Steve ran out of the tailor shop before it exploded in the distance behind him.)

Suit: Father! Nooooo!!

(The suit appeared to be self-aware as it freed itself from Rich Steve's grasp and escaped, the mannequin head falling off the suit.)

Rich Steve: Come back here! Come back here! Guards, stop hi- - (realizes his guards were still in the tailor shop) Oh, right.

(The suit kept running from Steve on the bridge, before it climbed on the rail and jumped off the bridge and into the water, much to Steve's chagrin.)

Rich Steve: You can't hide forever, suit! I paid $10 for you! I OWN YOU!

(Then the scene changed to The Park, where Benson and Skips were logging items in the Lost and Found box in the house.)

Benson: (pulls out a talking mounted fish) One mounted fish.

Skips: (writes it down) Got it.

Mordecai: (chuckles as he and Rigby walk in the living room) Let's go borrow Benson's car and go to the mall.

Rigby: Yeah, he won't care if we're gone all day. (chuckles as they both leave)

Benson: (sighs)

Skips: What's the matter? I thought you loved logging the Lost and Found Items.

Benson: No, I do. It's just... I feel like I've tried everything to get people to respect me. I tried screaming, yelling, furiously pointing; nothing works! (sighs again) Some life for a manager. (sees something in the box) Huh? What's this?

(The suit was in the Lost and Found box and Benson picked it up to look at it.)

Benson: Wow...! Who lost this, the President? Man, I bet a guy could get some real respect in a suit like this.

Skips: Looks like your size. You should try it on.

(The scene changed to Benson wearing the suit, and sure enough, it was his size.)

Benson: Huh. Not bad, right?

Skips: Lookin' sharp.

Benson: (turns around) Makes my butt look a bit flat though.

(As if on cue, the suit's pants inflated Benson's butt a little bit, catching him by surprise.)

Benson: (satisfied) Nice. You know what? Nobody ever comes back for this stuff anyway. I'm gonna keep it.

(The scene changed to the usual morning meeting spot outside the house, where everyone was present, except for Mordecai and Rigby.)

Benson: (walks in with the suit) Morning, everyone.

Muscle Man: Dang! Sick duds, bro.

Pops: Indeed!

Benson: (chuckles) Uh, thanks. Anyway, I, uh- -

(Then he saw Mordecai and Rigby in the cart arriving late to the morning meeting.)

Mordecai: Aw man, we're late! I told you we didn't have time for tacos.

Rigby: Nah, we're fine. He's not even here yet. (sees Benson) Wait, who's the new guy? Did Benson get replaced by a millionaire or something?

Benson: Very funny, guys. Try to be on time, okay?

Mordecai: (surprised) That is Benson!

Rigby: (whistles) Sweet threads! Dig up a rich old uncle?

Benson: (a little annoyed) I didn't dig anybody up. (softens up) But thanks. I feel... good.

Mordecai: Well, we're sorry for being late.

Rigby: Yeah. Won't happen again, sir.

Benson: (surprised) Wait, who? Me sir?

Mordecai: Yeah you, sir. You're the boss, right?

Benson: (confidently) Yeah! I am the boss! Let's get this day started!

(So with that, he started to take a stroll around the park in his new suit with his head held high. He winked at a motorcyclist on the way, who in return gave him a thumbs up. Benson winked at a woman, who was pushing her baby stroller with her, and she also gave Benson a thumbs up while the baby got up and did the finger gun gesture, as it said "Hey!" in an unusually deep voice. Then three teen punks were vandalizing a portable toilet, until Benson came up to them and told them to stop. The punks complied and put the portable toilet back up the way it was and left, respecting Benson as they passed him, while Muscle Man collapsed from the portable toilet in his bath robe. The clock wipe transition occurred, changing the scene to Benson going to a hot dog stand.)

Benson: Hey Joe. The usual, please.

Joe: (impressed) Looking classy, Benson! On the house. (gives Benson a free hot dog)

Benson: (takes his hot dog) Well, don't mind if I- -

(A scream caught his attention, and it came from a woman getting her purse stolen by a thief. Benson gasped in shock at the crime scene as he dropped his hot dog, but suddenly his suit was starting to power up as electricity sparked around Benson before the suit started to control Benson.)

Benson: Huh? Aah! My legs!

(The suit continued to control Benson, making him chase after the thief with the electricity still sparking around him.)

Benson: (shocked) What's going on?!

(Then he leapt towards the thief before he grabbed him by the shoulders and chucked the thief towards a flower stand, making him crash into it and fall to the ground, defeated.)

Benson: (amazed as he looks at his suit) Whoooooaa...!

(Another clock wipe transition occurred, where the police arrived to arrest the thief and one officer was with Benson.)

Officer: Nice work, son. Looks like you could show us boys in blue a thing or two. (points at Benson's suit) Shame about the suit though.

(Benson's suit was dirty during his encounter with the thief, causing him to yelp in shock. Later that day, at Benson's apartment, he had yellow cleaning gloves on and cleaning containers on the rug as he was ready to clean his suit up.)

Benson: (grabs brown cleaning container) Easy... (pours liquid on a rag) Just a dab...

(He scrubbed the rag on one of the stains and it completely came off as if it wasn't there.)

Benson: Huh. That was easy.

(Unfortunately, the bleach started to spread, whiting out parts of the suit, much to Benson's horror.)

Benson: No! No! No no no no no no no no no! NOOO-HOOOOO-HOOOOOO!!

(Later that night, Benson was outside of his apartment digging a hole with a bucket of wings around his arm. He placed the washed out suit in the hole and buried it.)

Benson: (a little drunk from the wings) Suit... you were the best thing that ever happened to me. You made me feel... (eats chicken wing) alive, full of... power, full of strong...ness! (tears brim in his eyes; holds a bottle of hot sauce) To you, suitmay we meet again in the next life.

(He poured the hot sauce on another wing and dropped it on the burial spot. Saddened, he left back to his apartment until the next day. Benson was asleep in his room and he was starting to wake up.)

Benson: (groggily) Mmm... good morning...

(He became fully awake when he saw his suit on his bed, in perfect condition too.)

Benson: (shocked) Wha...?! That's impossible!

(The next scene showed Benson putting his suit on as he looked in the mirror.)

Benson: This is either a miracle or I've gone insane. But who cares? I look good!

Suit: You sure do, Benson.

Benson: Thanks. Wha- -?! (turns around in shock) Who said that?

Suit: It's me, Benson, the suit.

Benson: You... can talk?

Suit: I can do many things.

Benson: (looks in the mirror) Why didn't you say anything before now?

Suit: I wanted to be certain that you were worthy. Incompetence aside, you showed me that you cared about me when you tried to clean that stain. I was created for a dark purpose, Benson. To be a status symbol for evil menevil, mysterious, powerful, handsome, wealthy men. But after these last few days, I've realized that I would rather be worn by someone with absolutely none of those qualities. I want to live a simple life as the suit of a simple man. You are that man, Benson.

Benson: Cool.

Suit: I'll never leave you, Benson. Also, if you're interested, I have a few ideas for keeping Mordecai and Rigby in line.

Benson: (confidently) Let's go manage a park.

(The scene changed to the next park meeting.)

Muscle Man: I don't know how you did it, bro, but wearing that suit two days in a row made it look even better!

(Everybody else agreed and complimented Benson's suit.)

Benson: (chuckles) Get used to it. I'm gonna be wearing this thing for the rest of my life.

Rich Steve: (offscreen) Unfortunately for you, that ain't gonna be that long.

(Confused, Benson turned around to see who spoke, and it was Rich Steve and his two goons, who survived the explosion from the tailor shop.)

Benson: Who are you?

Rich Steve: I'm the rightful owner of that fancy little three-piece you're wearing. And I'm gonna give you to the count of 10 to hand it over, before my goons flatten this park like a well-ironed shirt!

Benson: (to his suit) Suit, is that true? Who is this guy?

Suit: It's true. His name is Rich SteveSteve for short and he killed my father. He must've tracked me down from my built-in GPS signal.

Benson: That's horrible!

Mordecai: What the heck is going on?

Rigby: (confused) And is Benson talking to his suit?

Mordecai: I don't know, but that dude looks pretty evil. Come on!

(The guys came down the steps to Benson's aid.)

Suit: Benson, I don't want to be worn by this... this monster. Will you help me?

Benson: (determined) We're family now, suit. Of course I will. (to Steve) The suit belongs with me, Steve! Besides, you and your goons are outnumbered. You should leave while you still can.

Rich Steve: I see how it is. Well, let's see how you like these numbers!

(He snapped his fingers, and in an instant, an entire army surged forward to the park; gunmen, tanks, and choppers all came and surrounded the park guys.)

Rich Steve: Your move, Benson! The suit... or your life!

Rigby: (nervously) Uh... maybe just give him the suit.

Benson: This guy's hired an entire army! The six of us can't fight an army!

Suit: No, not the six of us; just you and me.

Benson: What?

(Then he felt his suit power up again and ran towards the army under the suit's control.)

Benson: Suit, no!

Mordecai: Benson, wait!

Benson: (still running) Aaaah, what are you doing?! This is crazy!

Suit: Just trust me.

Benson: I'M GONNA DIE!!

(When Benson ran through the army, they proceeded to pile up on him and beat him up, but then Benson burst out of the pile with great strength, sending every soldier flying.)

Benson: (amazed; looks around) Whooooaa...

Suit: Benson, work with me. If we fight as one, we can't fail!

Benson: I don't know anything about fighting!

Suit: Just let loose! Channel your anger.

(More soldiers charged at Benson with guns in their hands. Benson threw a punch at one of them, but the soldier dodged it and punched Benson in the face.)

Benson: Oww! (gets angry) Anger, huh? (wipes his mouth) Well, I've got plenty of that.

(As he clenched his fist, he started to power up before he grabbed the soldier and lifted him up.)

Benson: Hey Steve! Think fast!

Rich Steve: Human Shield #1, get into position!

Human Shield #1: Yes sir! (gets knocked out by the officer Benson threw at)

Rich Steve: Human Shield #2, you are now Human Shield #1!

New Human Shield #1: Yes sir! (calls someone on his phone) Debra, guess who just got that promotion!

(A motorcycle was thrown at the soldier, knocking him out as well.)

Rich Steve: Artillery, attack!

(A tank fired a shot at Benson, but he saw it coming, grabbed the tank shell and threw it back to the tank. The soldier in the tank jumped out of the way before the shell hit the tank, blowing it up, as the soldier crashed into a portable toilet, knocking it down, and Muscle Man rolled out of the portable toilet before going back to the park guys.)

Mordecai: Did you guys know Benson could fight like this?

Rigby: I wasn't even sure Benson had a pulse.

Rich Steve: Air attack!

(An attack chopper flew overhead and fired its Gatling gun at Benson, but it missed by a few feet between him. Benson leapt towards the attack chopper, landed on it and punched through the windshield, hitting the soldier piloting the chopper. Benson landed safely on the ground as the chopper crashed and exploded as Benson stood in front of the explosion like a badass while the park guys cheered for him.)

Rigby: Benson, you rule!

Mordecai: Yeah, Benson!

Soldier: (aims a rocket launcher at Benson) Let's see if you dodge this!

(He targeted Benson with the weapon and fired a missile at him. Benson took a deep breath and teleported before the missile could hit him. He backflipped in the air and landed near the missile launcher soldier, destroying the missile launcher and kicking the soldier to the ground. The soldier got back up and retreated, and so did Rich Steve's bodyguards, and so did the rest of his army.)

Rich Steve: Get back here! Your contracts stipulate that you fight to the death!

Benson: (watching the army retreat) Is that all of them?

Suit: Not all. Where's Steve?

(Then a tank fired a shell at Benson and hit him, sending him crashing through the house and dropping to the ground. groaning in pain. Rich Steve laughed evilly as he drove his tank to Benson.)

Rich Steve: If I can't have that suit, no one can!

(He fired another shell at Benson and that hit him as well, and the park guys gasped in shock at the scene.)

Rich Steve: (laughs) Yes!

(But Benson was still standing with a smug look on his face while he dusted some of the debris off his suit.)

Benson: (smugly) That all you got?

(Shocked that Benson was still alive from the hit, Rich Steve let out an angry yell and drove his tank towards Benson, using a tree as a ramp and crushing Benson with the tank.)

Park Guys: Benson!

Rich Steve: (laughs evilly) Eat THAT! (something rumbles under the tank) What the...?! No!

(Still alive, Benson miraculously lifted the tank above him with powerful strength.)

Rich Steve: Stay dead!

Benson: "Tanks," but...

Rich Steve: (scared) WAIT!

Benson: ...No "tanks!"

(He threw the tank as far as he could, with Rich Steve screaming before the tank exploded in the city.)

Benson: (laughs; exhausted) We did it! We're... alive...! (passes out)

Park Guys: (worried) Benson!

(They ran up to check on Benson before the next scene faded in with Benson turning on the lights in the basement with his suit in his hands.)

Benson: Are you sure about this?

Suit: Yes. As long as I exist, there will be power-hungry men willing to kill to wear me.

Benson: (sighs)

Suit: You know what you must do.

(Benson turned on the washing machine under the settings "Smash" and "Inferno" before he placed his suit above the washing machine with a rope.)

Benson: (tears brimming in his eyes) I'll miss you, suit. I'll never be respected the way I was when we were a team.

Suit: You didn't need me to earn respect, Benson; all you needed to learn was to take control of your life and respect yourself.

Benson: So... it really was me doing all the fighting.

Suit: No, that was pretty much all me. You don't have to tell Mordecai and Rigby though.

Benson: (shaking his head) I won't. So... what now?

Suit: You'll have to lower me since I can't deactivate myself. But also, I can't really reach the rope.

(So with that, Benson started to lower his suit down to the washing machine as he sniffled, tears streaming down his face.)

Suit: Time to get really clean.

(It raised its sleeve up and gave Benson a thumbs-up before being completely submerged in the water as Benson looked and gave the suit a thumbs-up too.)

Benson: Goodbye, suit.

(The suit began to malfunction as it said its last words to Benson.)

Suit: Goodbye, Benson.

(End of Benson's Suit)

(Episode starts with Mr. Maellard in his office with Benson.)

Mr. Maellard: Snacks disappearing from the snack bar? Holes in the walls? And 500 dollars worth of prank phone calls? It's ridiculous! What are you doing to my park, Beanteen?

Benson: But, sir, it's not my fault. It's Mordecai and Rigby. (points) It's right here in my report.

Mr. Maellard: Are you my park manager, Beanteen?

Benson: Yes, sir.

Mr. Maellard: Then everything that happens here is your fault.

Benson: Well, yes, technically but...

Mr. Maellard: Say it...

Benson: Everything that happens here is my fault.

(Mordecai and Rigby crash into the office with Mr. Maellard's limo.)

Mr. Maellard: My car!

Mordecai: Sorry, Benson, remember how I told you that I could drive stick? Well, I'm a little rusty.

Rigby: I told you you should have let me be the one to park it.

Mr. Maellard: Why are they driving my car when I specifically told YOU to park it?!

Benson: I did, sir, but I delegated it to Mordecai and Rigby.

Mordecai: Uh, this is getting a little awkward so we're gonna take off.

(Mordecai starts backing out of the office.)

Benson: Wait!

(The limo crashes to the ground, causing the alarm to go off.)

Mr. Maellard: That's it. Emergency meeting tomorrow. Things are going to change around here.

(Dramatic music plays as Benson looks rather sad. Clock transition to the outside of the park the next day. A blonde lady stands next to Mr. Maellard as he gives a speech to the park workers.)

Mr. Maellard: I'm sure you're all anxious to get back to work so let me make this brief to you now. Beancan, you're being demoted.

Benson: What?

Mr. Maellard: Everyone, this is Susan. She'll be taking over Beanton's duties at the park.

Susan: Thank you, Mr. Maellard. First, I would like to thank Benson for agreeing to step down from his position.

Benson: What?

Susan: I know this park's productivity has been inadequate for a long time. But now that I'm here, we're gonna get this park back in working order the Susan way. So Pops and Skips, I need you to clean the north-end fountain, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are on snack bar duty, Mordecai and Rigby... (flips page) ...and Benson, you guys will be raking the leaves.

Benson: What?

(It fades to Mordecai, Rigby and Benson raking leaves.)

Mordecai: Come on, Benson, we gotta rake these leaves, dude.

Benson: I can't do this.

Mordecai: Look, you're bummed out about getting demoted, but if you give it a chance, you'll see it's not that bad.

Benson: This... is horrible.

Mordecai: No, it's not, you're just in a bad mood. Look, you just need to take your mind off of it for a while and have some fun.

Rigby: Yeah, man, we can come back later and finish these leaves.

Benson: Ha, this is so typical. You get bored so you just slack off instead of finishing your work.

Mordecai: It's not slacking, we're just taking a break. And besides, it's not like you're working that hard anyway.

Rigby: Yeah, you're raking like an old man that has a fatter old man holding his arms down.

Benson: I don't feel like raking now, OKAY?!

Rigby: I'm just saying.

Benson: What if Susan catches us? She'll probably fire us for not working!

Mordecai: Dude, just calm down. We'll just pretend like we're working until she goes away. (M&R walk off)

Benson: Yeah, right, like anyone would ever fall for that.

Rigby: It always worked on you.

Benson: Ugh, fine. As long as it gets me out of raking these leaves.

(A montage of MR&B having fun begins. Rigby pours a bowl of cereal and shows it to Benson, but he turns his back to them. Later, M&R are reading comics. Rigby holds up a comic for Benson, but he crosses his arms and rejects. Later, Benson is actually having fun slacking as he plays stick hockey with M&R. Benson wins, and he smiles, going into another game, which he also wins. The three are then seeing floating in the fountain, relaxed. Then, they're seen playing video games while eating pizza, as well as putting their feet up on the table. Next, they drive up a grassy ramp with the golf cart and crush a sign that reads "keep off grass". They all cheer before spinning around in circles. Then, they're launching a water balloon from the roof, which hits Muscle Man. Next, they ride on icy cardboard bricks through the hills. Finally, the three drink sodas together, and Benson is clearly in a good mood as the montage ends.)

Benson: (laughs) I feel great!

Mordecai: See, I told you all you needed was a break. Now do you feel like getting back to work?

Benson: (laughs) No!

Mordecai: Wait, what? Dude, we have to go back to work eventually.

Benson: Yeah, right, I'm never working again.

Mordecai: No, seriously, we should go back to work. Susan's coming. (sure enough, she's walking down the steps. The three then approach Mr. Maellard's limo)

Benson: Ha, what's she gonna do?

Susan: Why aren't you all working?

Mordecai: Oh, uh, we were just washing Maellard's car, see, we're washing it, ha...ha... Come on, Benson, we're washing the car now.

Benson: I'm not washing the car.

Susan: Benson, why aren't you working?

Benson: Cause I don't feel like it.

Susan: Get back to work or I'll fire you.

Benson: Yeah? Do it.

Susan: Excuse me?

Benson: I've wasted my whole life at a dead-end job, and I'm not wasting another second working for you. (shrugs) So go ahead and fire me.

Susan: Okay, Benson, you're fired!

Benson: (Benson's face expression is still for a second)........ (put up arms) OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH! Come on, guys, lets get out of here!

Mordecai: Uh, actually Benson, we need this.

Rigby: Yeah, we need the money man.

Benson: Oh well, suit yourselves, I guess, but my life is happening right now and I'm gonna go live it. (Zooms out) Sayonara, suckers! WHOOOOO! WHOO-WHOO!

Susan: You two! Get back to work! (M&R get to washing the limo) Faster! (To Skips) And you, sweep those stairs! (to Pops) And you with the big head, finish those windows! (Pops scrubs the windows hard.) Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster, FASTER, FASTER! (Susan walks away from the cart as M&R work.)

Rigby: I don't want to work for Susan!

Mordecai: (somehow grew blonde hair tied back in a bun, like Susan) Dude, I know. (zoom closer into Mordecai's head)

Rigby: Mordecai?

(clock transition to Benson on a park bench)

Benson: Ah, jobless. Not a worry in the world. (paper flies onto handlebar of bench) Take that piece of trash for example. Normally, I do my duty as park manager and pick it up, but I say like it be someone else's problem, like nature's.

(Paper floats to a nearby tree. Benson lets out a sigh, and sees a hobo named Leon next to him)

Leon: You said it, brother. Who needs something like a job?

Benson: Right.

Leon: What does a job get ya? Some lousy money so you can buy things?

Benson: Right.

Leon: I'm Leon. But my friends call me Upt. That's short for Utopia, because I'm living the dream, man. (eats a sandwich)

Benson: I'm a...

Leon: I know who you are, Benson. Former park manager, now full-time slacker.

Benson: How did you know?

Leon" I used to be the park manager, and just like you, I gave it up for a life of slacking. Now, I don't worry about silly things like where Leon's gonna lay his head to sleep tonight cause sheet grats of a garbage compost is my pillow, the grease on my face is my shower. (Benson is shocked as the camera zooms into him.) Yes, sir, can't beat the life of a slacker, I'm proud to be the one to welcome you to your new life. (Benson starts running away.) Hey, where ya going?

Benson: I gotta get my old job back.

(clock transition to the house)

Benson: Hello? Susan? (He sees the back of Susan's head.) Susan, I need my old job back. (turns around to show that Mordecai has turned into a Susan lookalike, and so has Rigby.) What the?

Mordecai and Rigby: Benson, help us!

Benson: What happened?

Mordecai: (holds a spray bottle and a wiping cloth) The more we do what she says, the more we turn into... her!

Benson: Well, stop doing what she says!

Rigby: We can't.

Benson: Why not?

Mordecai: Because... she's standing right behind you.

(Benson turns around. Sure enough, she's standing right there, scaring Benson.)

Susan: What are you doing back here? Get out!

Benson: You're turning them into you! You can't do that! That's not how you manage a park.

Susan: What would you know about running a park?

Benson: I'll show you what I know. (hands M&R game controllers) Mordecai and Rigby, start playing video games.

Mordecai and Rigby: But we're supposed to clean.

Benson: Play video games or you're fired! (M&R sit down and start playing. They, for the most part, turn back to normal.) Play harder! Come on, put your feet up. (the dress pants and high heels turn into M&R's legs as they put their feet up) Eat this pizza while you play. (M&R are back to normal. Susan gets mad)

Susan: That's it! Mordecai and Rigby, go back to work!

Benson: No, you don't! Keep slacking!

(Susan's even more angry. Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost come into the room, also Susan-ized)

Rigby: Look! (shown as said) SKIPS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! POPS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? MUSCLE MAN AND HI-FIVE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!

Mordecai: Susan's turned them into Susans too.

Pops: Turn that off and clean up this mess!

Benson: Why don't you clean it?

(Muscle Man's hair slowly comes loose, and Hi Five Ghost grows his hand back. MM & Hi Five Ghost's faces are back to normal)

Benson: Everybody slack off, or you're fired!

(Muscle Man twirls his Susan jacket around in the air and Hi Five Ghost drinks a soda as they fade into their normal bodies. Skips goes to the corner and lays out playing cards, and his morph to his normal self rips his suit. Pops plays video games, morphing him into his normal self. Everyone's back to normal.)

Muscle Man: We did it!

(Everyone cheers. Susan gets really angry and growls like a monster before her body turns around and flies out the window. The park workers approach the window as a red, giant Susan comes out of the ground and eats the normal Susan. Her foot crushes the golf cart as the park workers look on.)

Giant Susan: GET BACK TO WORK!!!!

Benson: Don't listen to her! Keep slacking off!

Giant Susan: NO!!!! THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH EMPLOYEES LIKE YOU...(Giant Susan walks off, and quickly comes back carrying a jail building.) IMMEDIATE TERMINATION. (roars)

Mr. Maellard: Susan! (she looks down) What on earth do you think you're doing?!

Giant Susan: I'M RUNNING YOUR PARK FOR YOU, YOU OLD FOOL!

Mr. Maellard: This isn't how you run a business!

(Giant Susan throws the jail building aside)

Giant Susan: YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS!!!! (picks Mr. Maellard up as Benson comes down the steps)

Mr. Maellard: AAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAaaaAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAUGGGGGHHH! Beanton, Beanton! Help me, Beanton!

Benson: It's Benson! And I can't do anything unless you give me my old job back.

Mr. Maellard: Okay, yes, yes, you have your job back.

Benson: And your car keys.

Mr. Maellard: My car keys?! (Benson gives him a look.) .....My car keys, of course!

(Maellard throws Benson the keys, and he catches them. He then gets in the limo and drives up to Susan)

Benson: (gets out of the limo) HEY, SUSAN! (she looks at him) YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!!!!! (Benson starts driving toward Giant Susan, and, suddenly, Leon drives up with the golf cart and jumps into the limo, causing the cart to tumble off.)

Benson: Leon!

Leon: I've got this, brother. I've already had my season in the sun, but you've still got a whole lifetime of slacking in front of ya.

Benson: Actually, I changed my... (Leon pushes Benson out of the limo and takes the wheel.)

Leon: Time for me to blow this slacker wonderland! (Leon flips the limo over, causing it to tumble, eventually breaking off the heels of Giant Susan's shoes) Utopia.

(The limo crashes into a brick wall, exploding on contact.)

Giant Susan: (trips and lets go of Mr. Maellard) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! (falls into the pit, igniting a tall pillar of fire.)

(Benson walks over to the pit as the other park workers come up, congratulating him. Mr. Maellard walks up to Benson as well)

Mr. Maellard: Thank you, Benson, keep up the good work. (nudges Benson with cane and walks off. Everyone continues to congratulates him.)

Benson: Alright, alright! Everybody back to work. We've gotta get this mess cleaned up, now! (everyone but M&R walk off) And that means you Mordecai and Rigby. (hands Mordecai a broom and Rigby a shovel) You better keep working after I'm gone, because if I come back, and you're not, you're fired!

(Benson gets in the cart and drives away.)

Mordecai: Haha, yeah, good to have you back, Benson! (to Rigby) You wanna go play video games?

Rigby: Yeah-yuh.

(Benson looks at M&R walk up the steps in the car's rear-view mirror.)

Benson: Ahhh... It's good to be back.

(End of "Benson Be Gone".)

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby playing Xtreme Xcape)

Mordecai: Hm. Hm. I'm totally going to get to the bottom before you.

Rigby: Yeah, right.

Mordecai: Hm. I bet you can't shoot that barrel.

Rigby: Oh, yeah?

(Rigby shoots the barrel, unaware that it will do more harm than good. It explodes, and he ends up losing a life.)

Rigby: Aw, what?!

Mordecai: (Laughs) Don't shoot the barrels, man. I bet you can't get that power-up.

(Rigby gets the "power-up", but it turns out that Mordecai tricked him again.)

Mordecai: (Laughs) I can't believe you did that! I was totally kidding, that slows you down! Check out my dude. I'm glad I picked the dude with the more aerodynamic hairstyle.

Rigby: THAT`S IT!!!!! PAUSE THE GAME!!!

(Mordecai pauses the game)

Rigby: My dude's hairstyle is awesome, and I can totally kick your butt at this game!

Mordecai: You sound pretty confident. Care to wager on that?

Rigby: Yeah. If I win, you have to get your player's stupid haircut for a week. (Which is blonde)

Mordecai: And if I win, you have to get your player's "awesome" haircut. (Which is an afro)

Rigby: Fine, but you better not back down when I win, though.

Mordecai: Of course, dude, I never back out of a bet.

Rigby: Hm. Hm. We'll see about that.

(Rigby goes AHHH and AUGHHHHH as he falls on the couch dramatically)

Mordecai: What are you doing?

Rigby: I'm dying, dude!

Mordecai: Get up, man.

Rigby: No, seriously, man! My stomach is crazy dry right now! I must be dehydrated!

Mordecai: Ughh, what do you need?

Rigby: I need water.

Mordecai: Ughh. I can't believe how lame you are sometimes.

(Mordecai walks into the kitchen to make Rigby some water)

Rigby: Thanks, man.

(Rigby gets up when Mordecai is busy. He unplugs Mordecai's controller and says, "Don't forget to put ice in it." He then proceeds to put a sock over the plug to make it look like it's still plugged in.)

Mordecai: Here's your water, you baby.

(Rigby drinks his water)

Rigby: Thanks, man. Now that my stomach isn't dry anymore, I'm totally going to beat you.

Mordecai: Hm. Hm. I highly doubt it.

Rigby: Okay, I'll just un-pause it.

(The game starts back up. Rigby's character easily moves through the level, while Mordecai notices he`s not able to move his own character.)

Mordecai: What the heck?!

(Mordecai throws sock and finds his controller unplugged)

Mordecai: C'MON! HUH?!

(He quickly tries to plug his controller back in, but Rigby wins)

Rigby: OHHHHHH! In your face! You're gonna have to go blonde you LOSER!

Mordecai: Rigby! You didn't cheat, did you?

Rigby: What? No! I never cheat on a bet. Now back to what I was saying before you interrupted me, In your face! You gotta go blonde you LOSER! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

(Shows Mordecai and Rigby in the coffee shop. Mordecai has blonde hair.)

Rigby: Oh, My, BLONDE! (Cracks up hysterically) Ohh, that's it. I'm gonna start calling you "Blondecai". How many Blondecais does it take to order a cup of coffee? Just one. YOU! (Laughs hysterically)

(Margaret comes in)

Margaret: Hey, Rigby, I've got your usual. (Looks at Mordecai) Can I get you anything, sir?

Mordecai: Uhh, hey, Margaret. It's me, Mordecai.

Margaret: (Giggles) Um... I like your hair, Mordecai. Excuse me.

Rigby: Oh, man! Who knew winning a bet would be this hilarious! I gotta use it. (Gets up from his seat) Keep an eye on my coffee, blondie.

Mordecai: Jerk.

(Scene changes to Rigby washing his hands in the bathroom)

Rigby: Ahhh, it feels good to be the champ. Yet...I can't help but feel bad, somehow. Meh.

(Exits the bathroom to see Mordecai is gone)

Rigby (continued): Huh? He ditched me?!

(Mordecai and five other blondes laugh)

Rigby: Hm, hm!

Butt-chin Blonde: Your friend was bashing you pretty hard there.

Asian Blonde: Dumb jokes about your hair?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Butt-chin Blonde: Yeah, we've heard them all.

Asian Blonde: Normal hairs are always jealous of our style. And you my friend, have style.

Mordecai: Really?

Blonde: Yeah, man. You should totally hang out with us.

Rigby: (Walks towards the blonde group) Hey Blondecai, who were these guys?

Blonde: Oh, sorry man. We don't talk to normal hairs.

Rigby: Hm, hm. That's too bad, 'cause I've got a really funny joke for ya. How do you confuse a Blondecai?

(Blonde group is silent)

Rigby: You don't. They're born that way! OOOOOOOOHHHHH!

Blonde: Hm, that was pretty good. Here's a joke for you. What's brown, black, and blue, and lying in a ditch?

Rigby: Uh, what?

Blonde: You, if you don't take that back right now.

(Rigby screams)

Blonde: (Laughs) I'm just yanking your chain, man. It's cool.

Rigby: Huh?

Mordecai: (Laughs) OOOOOOOOHHHHH-

Black Blonde: (Puts hand on Mordecai's shoulder) Uh. He's had enough.

Rigby: (In defeat) Hm.

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby working at the park. Rigby throws a bag of garbage on the ground and Mordecai turns to look at him.)

Rigby: Hey, why did the Blondecai jump over the clock? (Giggles) Excuse me. So he can get some overtime!

(Laughs obnoxiously, snorts, and walks over to Mordecai)

Rigby (continued): You know, because you're dumb. (Punches Mordecai's arm playfully) Anyway, you wanna hang out?

Mordecai: Nah, I'm actually gonna go hang out with the blondes.

Rigby: Again? What do you do with those guys, anyway?

Mordecai: We play video games, watch movies, eat tacos, y'know, cool stuff.

Rigby: We do those things all the time. You should stay here.

Mordecai: And risk being made fun of? No thanks. See, the guys tell me the follically normative environment of this park is way too (Quotes) blonde hostile. Besides, the blondes are really cool.

Rigby: But, but Mordecai!

(Blonde group pull up next to Mordecai and Rigby)

Blonde: Hey, come on Mordecai.

Mordecai: (Runs towards the van) Hey guys.

Rigby: (Runs after Mordecai) Mordecai! You don't have to go.

Mordecai: Oh, yes I do! I'm Blondecai now, so I gotta hang out with these guys. See you later, dude!

(He closes the door, and the van pulls away)

Rigby: (Runs after van) Mordecai, wait! 

(Rigby runs up to Skips)

Rigby: Skips, Skips! I need your advice.

Skips: Let me guess: you cheated on a bet.

Rigby: How did you know?

Skips: I can tell by the shame in your eyes.

Rigby: It's true; I cheated on a bet and now Mordecai has a weird haircut and he's hanging out with all these creepy dudes an-

Skips: Rigby, you should have the courage to tell Mordecai you cheated. Even though he'll be upset at first, Mordecai will respect your honesty.

Rigby: Yeah. I was with you until the honesty and courage part. Is there any way I can get off scot-free?

Skips: Wait, you're not taking my advice?

Rigby: I got it! I'll just call the bet off.

Skips: (Laughs mockingly) Call the bet off. Okay. Don't say I didn't warn ya.

(Rigby enters their bedroom to see Mordecai packing clothing away)

Rigby: Mordecai, I wanna call off the bet.

Mordecai: What? No way. I never back out of a bet, remember?

Rigby: Forget about the bet. We can go back to you being Mordecai instead of Blondecai.

Mordecai: To be honest, I kind of like being Blondecai now. Without this bet, I never would've been able to make such cool friends. Well, thanks again, man.

(Walks out of room)

Rigby: Where are you going?

Mordecai: Oh, the blondes are going to let me move in until the bet is over.

Rigby: What!? (Walks out of room) No, that wasn't a part of the bet!

Mordecai: Dude, chill! It's only going to be until the end of the week. I don't know what your problem is.

(Mordecai drives away in a I-Haul truck, slamming the door behind him)

Rigby: (Runs after truck) Mordecai, wait! Mordecai, I have something to tell you!

(Montage of Mordecai and the blondes hanging out with Rigby following them. Cut to Mordecai and the blondes jogging home.)

Mordecai and the Blondes: Hut hut hut hut hut!

Blonde: Hoo! Alright, great fun run, gang. Let's go play some video games.

(Blondes jog away)

Mordecai: I'll catch up with you guys in a sec.

(Cracks knuckles)

Blonde: Okay.

(Mordecai cracks his back as the other blondes jog away)

Rigby: (Runs up to Mordecai) Mordecai!

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: I've been trying to talk to you all day, but those blonde creeps keep cutting me off!

Mordecai: Now I know you're trying to be nice and call off the bet, but the truth is, you've got skills, and you got me. You got me good.

Rigby: No, Mordecai, the truth is you don't have to do the bet 'cause I chea- chea- chee- chea- chea- chee- EEOH! Wow, bless me.

Mordecai: That was the weirdest sneeze I've ever heard. Well, it was good to catch up, but I better be going. I'm gonna be late for my secret club initiation.

Rigby: Initiation?

Mordecai: Yeah, apparently you get a really cool ring for joining. In fact, there's actually only one more thing I have to do before becoming a member.

(Starts walking forwards with arms out)

Rigby: Uhh, what's that?

(Walks backwards nervously and looks up to see two other blondes standing right behind him)

Rigby (continued): Mordecai, what's going on?

Mordecai: I need to blonde an outsider.

Rigby: Bl- bl- blo-

(Blonde bags Rigby. Cut to Rigby waking up hanging upside down. A large group of blondes is seen standing around him.)

Rigby: Huh? Mordecai, what's going on?

Mordecai: We're preparing for the blondening.

Rigby: The what?

Blonde: Brother Mordecai. You have made a pact with the order of the blondes. Here's a really cool ring to show that you're a member of our really cool club. (Puts ring on Mordecai's finger) Now you know what has to be done. Blonde the normal hair. To death.

(Floor opens to reveal bubbling peroxide)

Rigby: (Screams) Mordecai, don't do this!

Mordecai: I have to. I gotta take the good with the bad. A bet is a bet. Plus this ring is really cool, man.

(Rigby moans in response. Mordecai then pulls a lever, which slowly begins lowering Rigby towards the peroxide.)

Mordecai: Goodbye, Rigby. Thank you for helping me to realize my true self.

Rigby: (Pants) No! Mordecai! You don't have to do this! You don't have to be a blonde! The bet isn't even real! Because... I cheated! I cheated on the video game! I'm sorry!

(Mordecai stops lever so that Rigby is just above the peroxide)

Mordecai: That's all I needed to hear.

(Pulls off blonde wig)

Rigby: Huh?

Mordecai: I knew you cheated, dude. I was just waiting for you to come clean to teach you a lesson.

Rigby: Oh, so these blondes are all just wearing wigs to teach me a lesson, too?

Mordecai: Uh, no. They're actually an evil secret club. We should probably run for our lives now.

(Mordecai and Rigby run away as the blondes start chasing after them)

Blondes: Get them!

(Shoot laser beams from their rings)

Rigby: What the heck, dude? Those things shoot lasers?

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah.

Mordecai: Dude, peroxide?

Rigby: These guys aren't even real blondes!

(He suddenly notices something)

Rigby (continued): Look, an elevator!

(Mordecai and Rigby run towards the elevator)

Cyclops: Kill them. And take the sacred ring from the outsider.

(Shoots beams at Mordecai and Rigby)

Rigby: Cover me!

(Mordecai shoots at the blondes and knocks over some barrels)

Rigby: Dude, what are you doing? Don't shoot the barrels!

Mordecai: I'm not! They want their ring back-

(Switches the ring from laser mode to self destruct mode and puts it on the floor]

Mordecai (continued): -I'm gonna give it to them.

(Elevator dings)

Mordecai: (Pressing buttons frantically) C'mon, c'mon!

(Elevator dings and closes. Blondes pound on the elevator door. Mordecai's ring begins to increasingly beep faster.)

Cyclops: Oh man, that's not good.

(The ring explodes, causing the mansion caves. The elevator flies out and the doors open. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby being patched up and many police cars and ambulances parked outside the masion.)

Rigby: Well, Mordecai, I've learned my lesson.

Mordecai: Oh, yeah?

Rigby: Yeah, it's not cool to cheat on bets. And though my physical wounds are minor, this lesson will psychologically scar me for years to come.

Mordecai: So no cheating, huh? Would you care to wager on that? (Jokingly pulls out blonde hair dye)

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh. After a few seconds, however, Rigby turns to Mordecai, and with a serious expression on his face, says...)

Rigby: No.

[The episode starts with a montage of Muscle Man pranking Mordecai and Rigby as the Big Laugh by Jürgen Schlachter plays. He shakes a bottle of soda which Mordecai opens and it spills on him and Rigby.]

Muscle Man: [Laughs] Gotcha dudes! [Mordcai and Rigby head through a door and a bucket of water lands on them] Gotcha dudes! [Mordecai and Rigby are now playing a video game but their thumbs are stuck on a controller due to glue. Muscle Man is then seen again holding a tube of "Gloop D' Glue"] Gotcha dudes! [Scene then cuts to the hospital with Mordecai and Rigby's thumbs still stuck onto the controllers] Gotcha dudes! Gotcha dudes! Gotcha dudes! Gotcha dudes!

Everyone: Happy birthday Muscle Man!

Muscle Man: [tearing wrapping paper] Alright, gifts!

Mordecai: Dude, it's time to put Muscle Man in his place. You got the fake lottery ticket?

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm! [walks towards Muscle Man]

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man, happy birthday.

Rigby: Here's your birthday gift from us.

Muscle Man: What's this? Aw, a lottery ticket? Wow, you losers really bent over backwards to get me a great gift.

Mordecai: Come on, just scratch it.

Muscle Man: Yeah, right, I'm not scratching nothing. Nobody wins these things.

Mordecai: Come on, scratch it dude. You could win a million dollars.

Muscle Man: Fine, but I'm keeping this quarter. [grumbles and scratches a one million] One one million, big deal. [grumbles and scratches a second one million] (excitedly) Whoa, two in a row! Okay. [murmurs and scratches a third one million] (ecstatically) I matched all three! I won, I won! Kiss my rich butt, losers. Woo! [runs and spins around on grass]

Mordecai: Dude, he totally fell for it.

Rigby: I can't wait to see the look on his face when we tell him we pranked him! Come on.

Skips: Wait, guys. You gave Muscle Man a fake lottery ticket?

Mordecai: Yeah, why? What's the big deal?

Skips: The last guy who pranked him with money didn't end up so well.

[Scene cuts to a flashback where a raffle is taking place]

Skips: (voiceover) It all happened a couple of years ago during the park raffle.

Biggs: And the winner of the one hundred dollar gift prize is ticket number three four six.

Muscle Man: Woohoo! It's me! I won a hundred bucks, baby!

Biggs: Oops! That's not the right ticket number.

Muscle Man: Huh?

Biggs: The real winning number is three four five! [laughs] Gotcha, Muscle Man! [laughs] Look at your face!

Skips: (voiceover) Muscle Man didn't find the prank as funny as Biggs did.

Muscle Man: That was a pretty good prank you pulled back there, bro. I should return the favor. One good prank deserves another. [cracks knuckles]

Mordecai: What happened to the guy?

Skips: He never walked again. Or worked again, I can't remember, I don't know, I didn't really like the guy. But I like you guys, which is why you should be careful about telling Muscle Man you pranked him.

Mordecai: Dude, he almost killed a guy over a hundred bucks, imagine what he'll do to us over a million dollars!

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta go tell him before it's too late, come on.

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man, we need to tell you something.

Muscle Man: Hold up, bros, I'm busy. [elbows the table]

Mordecai: Whoa,whoa, Muscle Man, what are you doing?

Muscle Man: Now that I'm a millionaire, I'm gonna do some serious remodeling to this place. Now don't interrupt me again or I'll remodel your face. [smashes the table with his head]

Rigby: So maybe now's not a good time to tell him?

Mordecai: Yeah, probably not a good time.

Muscle Man: I'll put the Jacuzzi here. [smashes sofa] And the flat screen here. [smashes television] Now that I'm a millionaire, I can whip this place into shape. [walks out of living room whilst tearing a drape]

Benson: What the- (exasperated) Argh!

Benson: Alright, I've had it. Get out there right now and tell Muscle Man that lottery ticket's a fake.

Mordecai: We're working on it.

Benson: Well quit working on it, and just go tell him! He's trashing everything, because he thinks he can buy more stuff to replace it!

Muscle Man: (from the outside) Woo!

Muscle Man: [laughs] Oh, yeah! [steps on accelerator and breaks to let the trailer come loose]

Muscle Man: Out with the old, and in with the new. [throws flare onto trailer']

Rigby: Can't you just tell Muscle Man?

Benson: Yeah, right, I don't have enough time to be put in the hospital. (goes red) Now go tell him it's a fake or you're both fired!

Rigby: Dude, what are we gonna do?

Mordecai: Maybe if we break it to him gently?

Rigby: What, so only half of our bones are crushed?

Mordecai: No, I mean, if we get him in a good mood he won't be so mad when we tell him.

Rigby: Okay, but how do we do that?

Muscle Man: Aww, yeah, guys, thanks for taking me to the wings place to celebrate. It's gonna be my treat, because there's no way you can afford my appetite. [rapidly taps bell] Yo, service, service!

Muscle Man: You sure you guys don't want anything?

Mordecai: Uhh, no thanks, water's good.

Waiter: Okay sir, I've got the triple threat gourmet sauces right here. Platinum esquite barbecue, foie gras surpreme and chipolte hollandaise all in diamond encrusted containers.

Muscle Man: Aww, yeah, hook me up with that fancy sauce. I'm going all out now that I'm rich. All thanks to Moredcai and Rigby for giving me that lottery ticket. Now what was it you guys wanted to tell me?

Mordecai: Huh? What?

Muscle Man: Don't you remember? You said you wanted to break something to me. What was it?

Mordecai: Uh, I wanted to break these chicken bones with you, 'cause I know you love breaking things. [laughs nervously]

Muscle Man: You got that right, bro. I love breaking things. Especially things that disappoint me. Things like these meatless buffalo bones. [laughs and Mordecai and Rigby sweat at the same time] Oh, man, why is breaking bones so easy? (to the waiter) Yo, bro! Another round of wings up in here! In fact, now that I'm a millionaire, [stands up on chair] Hey, everyone! Wings on me!

Muscle Man: It's cool, I can buy another table now that I'm rich. All thanks to Mordecai and Rigby. Woo!

Moredcai: Dude, bathroom. Now.

Mordecai: This is getting worse. He's never gonna be able to pay for the stuff he's breaking.

Rigby: No thanks to you backing out of telling him the truth.

Mordecai: I don't see you telling him the truth.

Rigby: I'm not telling him!

Mordecai: Argh! Rock, Paper, Scissors for who has to tell him.

Rigby: Fine.

Mordecai: Argh.

Rigby: Hm hm hm!

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: Where'd he go? (to waiter) Hey, man, did you see where the fat guy with the lame t-shirt went?

Waiter: Oh, yeah, he said he was going to the lottery plaza to cash in his ticket.

Mordecai: Muscle Man, wait!

Muscle Man: What is it?

Mordecai: There's something we need to tell you. The lottery ticket. It's fake. We wanted to get you back for pranking us.

Rigby: It just got out of hand. We're sorry.

Muscle Man: It's okay, I'm not mad.

Rigby: Really?

Muscle Man: Nope. I'm furious!

Muscle Man: Well, what were you gonna tell me?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhh...

Rigby: Mordecai has something he wants to tell you.

Rigby: Oww!

Mordecai: I just wanted to tell you... that... I hope you don't forget us when you're rich. [laughs]

Muscle Man: Whatever losers. [Rigby makes arm language telling Mordecai what the heck!, Muscle Man puts the ticket into machine to be rejected. Pulls out ticket] Huh? [re-inserts ticket to be rejected repeatedly] Ticket not valid? Can you believe this? They're trying to cheat me out of my money!

Muscle Man: This machine's not valid! I have a winning ticket! Give me my money! [punches machine] I want my money! [kicks machine repeatedly]

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man calm down!

Muscle Man: [screeching] EEeeeeeeeEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeYAAAggghheeeeeEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!! MONNEEEEYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE...! [punches machine repeatedly]

Mordecai and Rigby: Unggh! Uggh!! UNNGHH!!! UGH!!!!

Muscle Man: EEeeeeeeeEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeYAAAggghheeeeeEEEEEEEEUUggghhh!!!!!!!!!!!

Man: Sir! Disrupting and tampering with lotto machines is a federal offence. If you do not stop we will use force!

Muscle Man: Force this! [picks up and throws man]

[Two other men charge at Muscle Man to be thrown back]

Man: Requesting backup for unit C, I repeat, we need backup!

Mordecai: Muscle Man, you gotta stop!

Modecai: Dude, this has gotten way out of control! We gotta tell him.

Mordecai: Muscle Man! We have something to tell you!

Muscle Man: Not now, bro, I'm trying to get my money that I rightfully won from the lottery ticket you guys gave me!

Mordecai: No, Muscle Man, you didn't win anything! The lottery ticket is a fake! We pranked you!

Muscle Man: [kicks a man over] Huh? What? You guys pranked me?

Mordecai: We're sorry! We didn't mean for it to go so far!

Rigby: Yeah, you were just pranking us so much we wanted to get you back!

Mordecai: Look at the ticket!

Muscle Man: You guys pranked me?

[Muscle Man is punched into unconsciousness by a man. The scene cuts to the lottery customer service building]

Man: Again I'm very sorry, we've been trying to recall those tickets for months now. We will of course take care of any damages to lottery property and personnel.

Mordecai: And the park too, right?

Man: Nope, sorry. Read the contract. You take care now. [closes door]

Mordecai: We're really sorry Muscle Man.

Rigby: Yeah, man.

Mordecai: We'll help pay for the wings.

Muscle Man: No that's cool, I can pay for those. I just can't believe you pranked me so hard.

Mordecai: You mean you're not mad?

Muscle Man: (smiling) Mad? Why would I be mad? A good prank is a good prank. (seriously) Hey, you bros have health insurance, right?

Mordecai: Yeah, why?

Muscle Man: 'cuz you're gonna need full coverage when I prank you back. [laughs]

(Mordecai and Rigby are playing video games. An explosion on the screen reads "PLAYER 1 WINS".)

Rigby: Ugh! I lost again.

Mordecai: Hmph. Hmph.

Rigby: This stupid thing was throwing me off. (Takes a magazine that reads "Mustaches Monthly - SPECIAL HANDLEBAR ISSUE!" out of the couch.)

Mordecai: Dude! Pops' Mustaches Monthly! Benson told us to deliver this weeks ago. You have to give this to Pops.

Rigby: What?! Why do I have to?

Mordecai: Because you're the tool who crammed it between the sofa cushions.

Rigby: I can't get up now. I'm going to lose this sweet butt cheek groove I've been working into this couch! It looks just like me!

(The butt cheek mark on the couch is visible.)

Mordecai: I'm not going up those stairs, dude.

Rigby: Fine, let's play rock-paper-scissors for it.

(Rigby plays paper and Mordecai plays rock.)

Rigby: Hmph hmph.

Mordecai: (groans) Whatever.

(Rigby plays the video game as Mordecai approaches Pops' room. We hear water running.)

Mordecai: Pops. Yo, Pops. I found your Mustache Monthly. (Puts Pops' Moustaches Monthly on a chair and turns his head around, before seeing Pops, just out of the shower and naked.) Aaaaagh!

Pops: Aaaaagh!

Mordecai: Aaaaagh!

Pops: Aaaaagh!

Mordecai: Aaaaagh! (In all the confusion, he now catches a glimpse of Pops' "junk mail").

Pops: Aaaaagh! (Pops covers his "junk mail" with his hat. Mordecai covers his eyes. They both try to leave but they're in each other's ways".)

Mordecai: (breathing) Uh... uh... uh... uh...

Pops: (breathing) Uh... uh... uh... uh...

(Mordecai finally escapes Pops' room as Pops goes into his bathroom. Mordecai goes downstairs and sits on the couch.)

Mordecai: Stop playing for a second. When I went upstairs, Pops was getting out of the shower.

Rigby: Yeah, so?

Mordecai: And he didn't have a towel.

Rigby: Ewww!

Mordecai: I tried not to look and just give him the magazine but I saw his...

Rigby: His junk mail? Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Mordecai: No, dude, I'm mentally scarred. It's like the image is glued in the inside of my eyelids. Every saggy, wrinkled, shriveled, pasty...

Rigby: Whoa, whoa! Don't put it in my head.

Mordecai: This is your fault. You have to help me.

Rigby: I'll help you to forget it if you promise to stop talking about it.

Mordecai: Deal. (They shake hands.)

(Cut to the arcade...)

Rigby: What you need is some Strong Johns.

Mordecai: Let's do it.

(They begin to play Strong Johns. Rigby starts losing and Mordecai starts winning, but then Mordecai sees both Johns turn into two versions of naked Pops.)

Mordecai: Ugh! (He runs away.)

Rigby: Mordecai, wait! (Sighs)

(Cut to the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: If this doesn't take your mind off of Pops, nothing will.

Mordecai: What, coffee? Thanks, dude, but I don't see how...

Rigby: (turns Mordecai's face to the other way) No, dude. Margaret.

Margaret: (While taking an order) So, that's two sandwiches and one soda.

(Mordecai does a love stare.)

Rigby: Hmmm? Hmmm?

Mordecai: All right.

Rigby: (while shaking Mordecai) Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm?

Mordecai: (pushes Rigby) All right. It worked.

Margaret: Hey, guys.

(Mordecai stares dreamily at her until seeing her face looks like Pops'.)

Margaret: Can I get you something to drink, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Aaaaargh! (runs away)

(Cut to the Movie Shack Hut...)

Rigby: Come on, let's get some movies. That'll get your mind off Pops.

(Mordecai looks at all the movies)

Mordecai: (Cut to a bunch of movie covers with naked Pops on them) Aah! (Cut to another row of naked Pops movie covers) Ohh...wha? (Covers his eyes) Ohh...

Rigby: See anything you like?

Mordecai: No...

Rigby: I'll go see if they have Good Cop, Sad Cop. (While Mordecai groans, Rigby goes to the checkout. We see a man watching Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent.) Hey, man, have any copies of Good Cop, Sad Cop? (The employee won't respond.) Hello?

VG: Sure, man. Let me check for you. (Types on his keyboard to check for Good Cop, Sad Cop.)

Rigby: So, no then?

VG: Oh, yeah. No.

Rigby: All right. Just these and whatever my friend's getting.

(Cut to Mordecai looking at a Cowboyz poster. He groans like he saw naked Pops instead of the cowboy.)

Rigby: I guess just these. (Pushes over the movies and notices the TV.) What are you watching?

VG:  Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent.

Rigby: Is it good?

VG: I watch Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent  all day everyday. All day, everyday...

(Anime characters fly around the screen as J-Pop plays. A character with black hair dressed in a blue suit runs away from an attacking UFO. The blue-suited character and another character with blonde hair and a tuxedo fight each other using superpowers. Stars pop out of the blue-suited character's eyes.)

Rigby: Aw, how do you watch that? It's like barfing rainbows in my eyes.

VG: I watch Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent all day, every day.

Rigby: You already said that.

VG: I watch it all day, every day.

Rigby: Dude, you already said that. Don't you remember?

VG: All day, every day.

Rigby: What?

VG: I watch it all day, every day.

(The two characters fight each other again.)

VG: Every day.

Rigby: Whoa...

(Rigby ejects the tape and grabs it.)

Rigby: I'm just gonna borrow this.

(Back at the house, Rigby puts the tape in the VCR)

Rigby: Trust me, man. This will make you forget.

Mordecai: (covering his eyes) No, no. I'm not looking at anything ever again. Every time I open my eyes, I see Pops naked.

Rigby: Just give it a chance.

Mordecai: No!

(Rigby grabs Mordecai's arms.)

Rigby: Look at it! Look at it! Look at it!

Mordecai: Get off! I'm not looking at a stupid--

(Mordecai opens his eyes wide and sees Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent on screen in all its glory. He is spellbound and his pupils expand to massive proportions.)

Rigby: Yes!

(Rolls of film fly out of Mordecai's eyes and into the bright TV screen.)

Rigby: Coooool...

(Each film cel shows a piece of Mordecai's memory. Rigby tries to grab one, but things spiral out of control and Mordecai floats in the air, with film still flying into the TV. The music from Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent grows faster and faster until finally everything stops and Mordecai drops onto the couch, the TV off.)

Rigby: Did it work?

(The TV shows 'THE END'. Mordecai groans and mumbles incoherently.)

Rigby: Mordecai! Do you remember seeing Pops naked? Pops naked? Nude? In the buff? Naked Pops, naked Pops, naked Pops. (Mordecai doesn't respond. His head is slumped onto his chest.) Awesome! Dude, it totally worked! Up high! (Mordecai doesn't take the hi-five.) Let's... get you some coffee.

(At the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: Margaret! The usual: two coffees, please. Better make that espresso.

Margaret: Hey Mordecai, you're back! Feeling better?

(Mordecai groans in response.)

Margaret: (nervously) Mordecai?

(Mordecai groans more and Margaret walks away to Eileen.)

Eileen: Oh my gosh, is Mordecai ignoring you?

Margaret: Is it just me, or does Mordecai look like he's been working out?

Rigby: Mordecai, snap out of it. We're finally gonna have some fun! Just two friends hangin' out, lettin' the good times roll. Like old times!

(A montage scene follows. Rigby puts on his 'TEAM RIGBONE AND MURDECAI' bowling gear and rolls a spare at the bowling alley. Mordecai stares straight ahead, slack-jawed and unresponsive. Next, Rigby tries to prank Muscle Man by throwing 'Balogna' all over his car, but Mordecai doesn't laugh or exchange a hi-five as Rigby yells in frustration.)

Rigby: Augh! Gimme back my friend!

(Outside Skips' house, Mordecai stands unconscious as Rigby talks to Skips.)

Rigby: He's been like this ever since he watched a video. And now he doesn't remember any of the stuff we used to do.

Skips: Video? It wasn't Planet Starlight: Chasers Excellent, was it?

Rigby: Uh... Yeah, why?

Skips: We have to watch the tape.

(In the house, Skips sits with Rigby and Mordecai on the couch as Rigby presses play on the remote. The music kicks in, and Rigby and Skips are pulled into the TV via the film reels in their eyes. They land in a dark environment like Regular Show's title screen.)

Rigby: We're in! Wait, where are we?

Mordecai: We're in the tape, dude.

Rigby: Mordecai! Dude! We're here to rescue you.

Mordecai: What's the point? Whether I'm in here or out there, I can't forget about seeing Pops naked.

Rigby: Augh! You're still thinking about that? Get over it already.

Mordecai: You don't get it, dude. It's not something you can just un-see.

Skips: We have to change your memory.

Mordecai: What do you mean?

Skips: If we find your memory of Pops and cover it, you won't remember seeing him naked.

Mordecai: Where do we start?

Skips: Your memories are over there.

(Skips points past a lot of doors to one glass door that looks like the entry to the house. "Mordecai's Memories" is on its front.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa.

Rigby: Weird.

(The trio enter the door, and the room inside flips vertically to become the Coffee Shop.)

Rigby: Why are we in the coffee shop?

(Several different Mordecais, Margarets and Rigbys are standing around talking, joking, arguing, etc.)

Skips: These are his memories.

Rigby: Whoa! (sees Mordecai whaling on him on a table) Oh, yeah, I remember that too.

Skips: This isn't the memory we need.

Mordecai: Yeah. We need to find Pops' room.

Rigby: Easy: let's go back to the house. There's the exit.

(Through the exit door is the video score, with VG watching Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent.)

VG: All day, every day. (quieter) All day, every day.

Skips: Memory isn't logical. We'll have to keep looking 'til we find the-

(Through the video store door, they enter the park.)

Mordecai: The house! We're getting closer.

(The three enter the house. The stairs up to Pops' room suddenly grow to several times their normal length and the trio ascend through an Escher-style drawing of the house, covered with framed pictures.)

Mordecai, Rigby and Skips: Pops' room!

(The door opens. Pops is standing naked, facing away from the door.)

Rigby: Oh, gross!

Skips: Quick, cover him with that blanket.

(Mordecai and Rigby grab the blanket and make to cover Pops, but the floor creaks under Mordecai's foot, causing Pops to turn toward the sound. Pops laughs, jumps out of the way, and so begins an epic chase through the house, with Pops escaping from the room by crawling on the ceiling.)

Mordecai: What... the...?

Skips: Get him!

(When the trio follow Pops through the door they fall from the sky onto the park grass. They chase Pops through a crowd of Bensons.)

Crowd of Bensons: You idiots... if you don't clean this place up... you're fired! You're fired! You're fired! (repeats) Hang on... you're fired! (keeps repeating)

(Pops escapes through a door to nowhere marked Exit. The trio follow him through and end up emerging from a couch, in a room with several couches, large and small. Through a trap door, they end up back inside the tape, chasing Pops.)

Rigby: (while sprinting) Pops isn't really like this. We're never gonna catch him! How come he's so fast?

Mordecai: I don't know! I just remember everything happening really fast. Like, I put down the magazine and all of a sudden Pops was there. It was just like he uh-- (Mustaches Monthly flies from the sky and hits Mordecai in the face.) Huh?

Rigby: (gasps) That's it! Just start remembering stuff, dude?

Mordecai: What?

Skips: You have to use your memories to catch Pops.

Rigby: Think of something!

(Mordecai struggles to remember, and the golf cart appears piece-by-piece.)

Rigby: Think harder.

Mordecai: I'm trying!

(The golf cart appears in full.)

Rigby: Yes!

(The trio jump in the cart and Mordecai drives it towards Pops)

Rigby: He's still too fast!

Skips: Remember something to block his path.

Mordecai: I can't!

Rigby: Remember that time we ate all that cereal?

Mordecai: Yeah, we must have eaten like a million boxes because you wanted that lame Strong Johns figurine.

(A cascade of cereal and milk forces Pops to change his path.)

Mordecai: Uh... I remember when Margaret had that gigantic boyfriend!

(A giant, bald, musclar man appears. Pops nearly gets ground-punched as the guys in the cart cheer, but this turns the giant's attention to them, and the cart only narrowly avoids being crushed.)

Rigby: Nice!

Mordecai: Margaret's boyfriends were always really lame.

Skips: We have to cut off his path.

Mordecai: Uhhh... I remember that crazy steep cliff at the end of the park! (A huge cliff ramps upwards.) Ha ha, now he's got nowhere to go.

Rigby: He's not slowing down!

(Pops runs to the top of the cliff and gracefully dives off as the trio pull the cart to a halt right at the edge, watching him fall.)

Rigby: Now what?

(Mordecai turns the cart around and drives full-speed back towards the cliff's edge.)

Rigby: Dude, what are you doing?

Mordecai: Getting rid of that memory.

(The cart falls through the air. Pops, laughing, is dancing as he falls down. Mordecai leaps after him with the blanket and manages to smother him, covering his body.)

Mordecai: I did it! I caught him!

(Mordecai finds the blanket is now empty and the ground is approaching fast. The three scream and get ready for impact.)

Mordecai: Uh... uh... I remember the time we ripped a hole in that kid's bouncy castle!

(A bouncy castle appears on the ground. The three land safely, but the castle deflates and screaming kids scatter in all directions.)

Rigby: Did it work?

Mordecai: Yeah, I think so. How do we get out of here, Skips?

(Skips shrugs.)

VG: I think I can help.

(VG is standing next to them, looking clean-cut and eager.)

Rigby: It's the guy from the video store!

VG: There's a tape sticking out of that wall over there. Grab onto it and you should be home free.

Rigby: Don't you wanna leave, too?

VG: Nah. I'm kinda into not having to work for the rest of my life.

(The trio walk towards a massive TV and video as VG waves them goodbye. They grab the video sticking out of the wall.)

Mordecai: Here goes...

(The Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent theme plays as the tape reels fly back out of the TV and into the bodies of Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips on the couch)

Mordecai: It's gone! Naked Pops is gone! I don't remember it anymore!

(Benson walks into the living room, wearing a towel, and sees all the film.)

Benson: What did you guys do? What is this mess? I can't even take a shower around here without you guys screwing things u--

(Benson's towel drops off. His gumball dispenser is open. The trio looks at him silently. The episode ends with the PC: SE theme playing before fading to black.)

(Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are building a tile sculpture of Mr. Maellard, everybody groans)

Muscle Man: You know, guys. I'm usually one to relish my work, but today's been brutal.

Mordecai: Yeah, I feel like we've been building this honorary landscape in Mr. Maellard's likeness for forever!

Rigby: Totally! I mean, how do we even know if it looks like him!

(The shot shows a birds eye view, where the sculpture looks a lot like him)

Hi Five Ghost: I can't feel my arms anymore.

Mordecai: It looks like there's only one thing to do. Ask Benson to give us a break! Hey Benson! Can we get a break?

(Benson turns around)

Benson: A what?

Mordecai: A break!

(Benson drops his notepad and walks up to the guys)

Benson: Oh, you want a break?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Rigby: Yeah?

Muscle Man: I guess.

Hi Five Ghost: I thought so.

Benson: I'll give you a break.

(Benson walks backwards, snaps his fingers and starts breakdancing. Everyone is amazed)

Benson: Break's over.

(he gets up and walks off)

Everyone: OOOHHH!!!

(Benson's eyes glow blue and the God of Breaking exits his body)

God of Breaking: You alright, man?

Benson: Yeah, I'm good. But seriously, thanks for your help, God of Breaking. I really appreciate it!

God of Breaking: Yeah, no problem. And remember, the only way to get your employees to respect you is to be really good at breaking! (he spins around and dissolves)

(Episode starts with the opening. Electronic music plays. Blueprints are shown of previous items in Regular Show, such as the Maximum Glove from "Video Game Wizards", the I'm Eggscellent hat from "Eggscellent", and the Basketball Shoes from "Slam Dunk". Hyperduck is then shown and he does a fist pump that gives out a blue aura. The title screen is then shown, saying "Regular Show: Brilliant Century Duck Crisis Special" with Japanese caricatures behind it. The anime opening then begins, with a person singing in the background. White flashes spark and a faded Mordecai is shown, as well as a small silhouette of him. The words "Created by J.G. Quintel" are shown. Then two faded Rigbys appear with "Written and Storyboarded by: Toby Jones, Owen Dennis" at the bottom right. Next, Benson, Muscle Man, and HFG are shown standing on a small cliff with wheat growing and with mountains in the back. They have their backs away from each other, looking down at the ground. "Supervising Art Director: Paula Spence" and "Supervising Producer: Sean Szeles" are shown at the top. Skips and Pops are then shown under a black background with small flashes. Skips poses while holding a red ribbon, and Pops also poses, holding a red rose. "Opening Music: Daybreak On A Rose~Petal" by Mutato Muzika and Owen Dennis" is shown at the bottom right. Rigby is then shown with a dark blue background preparing to fist pump. Mordecai joins him. They fist pump and suit up with the same outfits shown in "A Bunch Of Full Grown Geese". The Maximum Glove and Basketball Shoes are activated and Hyperduck is shown again. Mordecai and Rigby are running down a hill with Hyperduck's head behind them. The words "Baby Ducks" flash and Hyperduck's Maximum Glove rockets out of his arm, punching the four-headed geese monster. A series of small things flash past, including Andy's spacecraft, the evil Gooseowary X, a drawing of Mordecai with a red background, the word "Park", Pops in fetus form while naked, the word "Hamboning", an aerial view of the Park, the word "Tokyo", and Hyperduck firing music lasers. Then scenes from previous episodes are shown. The Duck Hunter getting chopped in half and Mordecai, Rigby, and the Baby Ducks "OOOOOHHHH!!"ing are shown from "A Bunch Of Baby Ducks" and Skips and Pops dancing with Party Pete's girls (who are seemingly twerk dancing) is shown from "Party Pete" for a split second. Then Mordecai and Rigby are shown riding in a car while Hyperduck flies from above. Another series of small things flash, including the Mother Duck, a duck with sunglasses that reflect the sky, an eye from a creature with a small red laser maze in its pupil, Mordecai and Rigby's fists fist bump while wearing the PlayCo Armboy from "Over the Top", Rigby setting the baby ducks free using one hand, Mordecai singing into a microphone with his outfit from "Return of Mordecai and the Rigby's", Hyperduck's face, the word "Fist Pump", Hyperduck punching his hands together, and Japanese caricatures. Mordecai and Rigby are shown with the outfits from "A Bunch Of Full Grown Geese" again and are playing video games inside Hyperduck. Hyperduck then runs forward. Mordecai and Rigby are then shown behind the blue background again and look up. Then Rigby is shown without the outfit behind the Regular Show purple back ground, crying sparkle tears and blushing. Next Mordecai, Rigby, and the Baby Ducks are shown laying on the grass and looking up at the sky, smiling. Finally, Hyperduck, and the Park Crew, including Mordecai and Rigby with their outfits from "A Bunch Of Full Grown Geese", are shown on a hill looking at the sky ahead of them. Behind them are mountains and a sun slowly setting, with a flock of geese flying towards it. The song ends and everything fades to black. After a couple of moments, the Earth is shown)

Narrator: (Park house is then shown) Everything seemed perfectly normal for our heroes. Just another ordinary day at the Park. Until... (Carter and Briggs are on T.V.)

Carter: (blazing a flamethrower at a person, turning them into a skeleton) YAAAAAHHH!!! (throws flamethrower)

Briggs: Now that's what I call, playing with fire!

Carter and Briggs: (while spinning donuts in their police car) AWWW YeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeYEAH!

Carter: (showing Carter and Briggs, Carter pulls down sunglasses) And now a word from our sponsors.

PlayCo Businessman #1: (cuts to his face) Carter and Brigs love to spin donuts in their car.

PlayCo Businessman #2: (pans out to show him behind the other businessman) And we like to spin circles around the competition with our toys!

PlayCo Businessman #1: (cuts to a different angle showing the side of his face, but he is turned towards the camera with a smirk) Hi, we're PlayCo Industries. (points to camera) If you know us, you know our name is synonymous with (cuts to a list with a blue toy next to it, they showing another weird toy) quality, innovation, and just the best darn toy products on the market. (Cuts back to both businessmen) Isn't that right (they look slyly to the left) (Carter and Briggs appear next to them and the businessmen pretend to act surprised) Carter and Briggs!?

Carter: (nervous look, fake smiling, monotone) Yep, we sure like your toys.

Briggs: (both Carter and Briggs look at the camera and fake smile, Briggs looks upset) Our contract says we have to.

Rigby: (cuts to Mordecai and Rigby right by the T.V.) Woah, Carter and Briggs are doing commercials now?

Mordecai: Maaaan, I can't believe they sold out like this!

PlayCo Businessman #1: (cuts back to T.V., is laughing way too hard and slamming hand on the table) HAHAHA! (calms down) Oh man, those guys! And now a special look at our new line of Carter and Briggs figures!

PlayCo Businessman #2: (whispering to Carter and Briggs) Say it!

Carter and Briggs: (unenthusiastically) Awwww, yeyeyeyeyeyeyeah... (Cuts to special look)

Commercial Voice: (Shows Briggs going into time portal and Carter watching him) Carter follows Briggs into a time portal to become (shows toys) Carter and Briggs 3099! (shows toys in action) Alien crime lord attacks! (Alien toy breaks down toy wall) 

Child Voice #1: (Playing with alien) Give me all your credits!

Commercial Voice: (shows toy Carter by the alien) Carter swopes in with his hover suit! (shows toy Briggs) Briggs hits the bad guy with non lethal fractal kick!

Child Voice #2: Hi-yah! (toy kicks alien)

Child Voice #1: Waugh! (toy alien falls in garbage can)

Child Voice #2: (Playing with Briggs toy) You have the right to remain dead!

Two Boys: (Shows two boys, one holding toy Carter and the other holding toy Briggs) Travel through time, tough on crime!

Commercial: (Shows toy Carter and Briggs, the alien toy, and a toy version of Carter and Briggs' police car) Carter and Briggs toys sold separately. From PlayCo. (Cuts to brand logo) PlayCo!

Mordecai: (holding up toy Carter in front of the T.V.) This piece of junk costs fourteen dollars? (Cuts to Mordecai and Rigby kneeling on the floor with the Carter and Briggs toys in the living room of the house) It looks horrible!

Rigby: No kidding. (cuts to him putting the toy near his face and mimicking the error with his eye) Mine's eyeball looks like it's leaking into his face!

Mordecai: (tries to make it stand up, but it falls) They can't even stand up on their own.

Rigby: I know! (Picks up Carter and has Carter and Brigg's backs to each other) You have to, like, lean them against each other!

Mordecai: (picks up Carter) And Carter's shirt! (points at the toy's torso) They painted it skin color so it looks like he's just shirtless. I hope somebody got fired for that one. (To Rigby) How about the fractal kick? Does that work?

Rigby: (Prepares to launch) Fractaaaaaaaaal! (it launches and lands in Benson's tomato bisque that he is eating on the couch)

Benson: (looks at Mordecai and Rigby) Grrrrrr! You ruined my tomato bisque with your ridiculous toys!

Mordecai: (In a know it all manner) They're not toys! They're collectibles? (normally) (looks at toy) At least, they're supposed to be.

Rigby: Yeah, these are pretty much garbage. PlayCo, more like PlayNo. (Chucks the Briggs toy towards the front door. It hits the door as Pops comes running in)

Pops: (crying manner) WAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! (runs to the couch, then uses an annoyed Benson's head as support when he runs towards the curtains. He uses them like a security blanket. Pops won't stop crying. The three others run over)

Mordecai: (concerned) Pops, what's wrong!?

Pops: (crying/yelling) I was ATTACKED by a prehistoric BEAST!

Rigby: (concerned) What, you mean like a dinosaur?

Pops: A DINOSAUR!!! WAAAAAHAHAAA!

Rigby: (To Mordecai) Have we- have we seen one of those before?

Mordecai: (shakes a "no" back to Rigby)

Rigby: Huh. Well, I guess today's the day.

Benson: (to Mordecai and Rigby) It's not a dinosaur! *sigh* Come on, let's scope it out.

Mordecai: (complaining) Aw maaan.

(Scene cuts to outside, where a cassowary is seen. It screeches at the workers hiding behind some bushes)

Rigby: What? That's not a dinosaur at all.

Skips: It's a double-waddled cassowary, an extremely aggressive gladiatorial bird. (Just his voice as the cassowary is shown) It's claws could tear through just about anything. (The cassowary then cuts a tree down using only one foot)

Benson: (Slyly looks at Mordecai and Rigby) Well, this looks like a perfect job for Mordecai and Rigby. (Annoyed) (walks away with Pops) Get that thing outta here or you're fired.

Skips: I strongly recommend wearing protection. (Mordecai and Rigby shake out of fear and look at each other) (Scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby suiting up. Music starts playing. Mordecai puts on a red football helmet and Rigby puts a trash can lid on his chest. Scene shows the cassowary standing on a dirt road in the Park, looking around, when Mordecai and Rigby run toward it, banging pots and pans. The cassowary stares at them for a second and headbutts Rigby's pot and pan. It then kicks them away)

Mordecai and Rigby: OW!! AH!! (Next, the two are seen behind a bush, still wearing the "protective" gear. Mordecai is shown with a remote control. A small red toy race car comes out of the bushes in front of the two. Mordecai moves it forward until it runs into the cassowary's leg. The cassowary, having not noticed it until then, turns its head around and looks at it. The car hits the leg again, and the cassowary steps on it, destroying it. It keeps stepping on it while looking at Mordecai and Rigby. A part of the car lands in front of the bush they are behind. The part sets on fire and Mordecai and Rigby look at each other. Then, Mordecai and Rigby are shown driving forward in the golf cart, still wearing the "protective" stuff) AaaaaaaaAAAAAHH!! (They advance towards the cassowary)

Mordecai: (Yelling) I'm scared dude! I'm scared!

Rigby: (Also yelling) If I don't survive this, don't touch any of my stuff! Turn it into a Rigby museum!

Mordecai and Rigby: (Still advancing) AAAAAAAHHHHH!!! (Just as they are about to hit the cassowary, they stop. The music stops. They stare at it in horror. Mordecai beeps the horn on the wheel. "BEEP BEEP". The cassowary steps back a few steps)

Rigby: (Happily) Dude, it's working! (The cassowary stops. Everything is silent, until the cassowary opens a hatch on its chest and reveals three missiles)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Nervous and shocked) *GASP* (The cassowary launches the missiles at them) AaaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHH!! (They jump out of the cart and the missiles hit the cart, causing it to disappear into nothing)

Mordecai: *Cough, Cough* (Groans)

Rigby: (Groans) (Both slowly look up at the cassowary)

Cassowary: RAAAAAAAAAAAR!

Mordecai and Rigby: AAAAAAAHHHH!!!! (They start running away while the cassowary chases them)

Mordecai: (While running) Dude call them, call them!

Rigby: (Pulls out phone while still running) (Panicking) (Scene shows Rigby's phone's screen and reveals he is going to call the Baby Ducks) 

(Scene then cuts to the Baby Ducks. Rock music starts playing. One is skydiving, another is skateboarding, another is riding a BMX bike, and another one is rollerblading down a rail pipe. All four are shown, they take off their stuff, and fly down to the ground. A blue aura is formed and the baby ducks land in between Mordecai and Rigby and the cassowary. Music stops)

Mordecai: (Smiles and is relieved) Baby ducks!

Baby Ducks: Hey dudes! (face the cassowary, one of them points at the cassowary and speaks) Time to send this cassowary bot to the cemetery lot! (Rock music starts again. They fist pump and are about to form Hyperduck, when a limo arrives. They stop the formation and the music stops) Huh? (One of them speaks) Did you guys order a limo? (A different one speaks) That's not a goose. (Another different one speaks, slowly) It's not our birthday yet.

PlayCo Businessman #1: (Opens limo door) (Slowly and menacingly, smirks) Baby ducks!

A Baby Duck: (angry) PlayCo!

PlayCo Businessman #1: (Comes out of limo with the other businessman, holding a briefcase. They stand next to the cassowary) You fell right into our trap.

PlayCo Businessman #2: (Shows contract to Baby Ducks) Now sign the toy contract, (clenches fist) or we'll be force to use more extreme measures.

Mordecai and Rigby: Toy contract?

A Baby Duck: They've been bugging us about this for months.

Another Baby Duck: We'll never sign!

PlayCo Businessman #1: (Only voice as scene shows Mordecai and Rigby) Mordecai and Rigby! (Shows the businessmen) We need you to sign too.

Mordecai: What?

PlayCo Businessman #1: That duck warrior you and the Baby Ducks turned into, (evily) it would make an amazing toy.

PlayCo Businessman #2: So whaddaya say? (Evil smirk) Sign over your likenesses?

Mordecai and Rigby: (Disgusted groan) UGH!

Mordecai: (Furiously points at them) No way! Your toys suck.

Rigby: (Also points) Yeah PlayCo! More like LameCo!

Mordecai: (To Rigby) (Gets idea. Rigby looks at him, confused) Wait wait, (Mordecai laughs lightly) more like (looks at businessmen) PlayBlowers! (Rigby sneers at them)

Mordecai, Rigby, and The Baby Ducks: OOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!

PlayCo Businessman #1: (Annoyed) Hmm... Well, (opens briefcase to show one one hundred dollar bill inside) does this Play-Blow?

(Opens briefcase and $100 is show)

Mordecai: (Annoyed) You think a month's pay is gonna change our minds?

PlayCo Businessman #1: Fair enough. (Throws briefcase aside and takes another briefcase from the other businessman. Opens it up to reveal prototypes of the toys) But maybe a look at our prototypes will.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Squint and walk over to the briefcase, curious) 

A Baby Duck: Careful dudes!

Mordecai and Rigby: (Look at prototypes) HEY!

Mordecai: (Scene shows toys in briefcase, Mordecai's voice only) These are horrible! (Both grab the toy versions of themselves)

Mordecai: (Looks at the toy, annoyed) They only have like, three points of articulation!

Rigby: (Also looking at toy, annoyed) Yeah, and they don't look anything like us! (Looks at businessmen) Maybe if you at least got the colors right.

PlayCo Businessman #2: (Yelling) Hey! Who here runs a billion dollar TOY company?!?

PlayCo Businessman #1: (holds him back) Cool it, Neil. (Neil glares at Mordecai and Rigby) Hehe, uh, look guys, it's too expensive to change the molds at this stage. (Keeps trying to convince them) Aw, come on! Kids won't notice anyways.

Mordecai: You screwed up the Carter and Briggs toys, and the us toys (both throw the toys away at the word us) are even worse. NO DEAL! (Both cross their arms)

PlayCo Businessman #1: Weeeee thought you might say that. (Both businessmen evily smirk) So we invited some friends to help convince you. *Snap* (Another limo then arrives and the Full Grown Geese open the door)

A Goose: RAAH!

A Baby Duck: Geese!

Neil: (Confident) Heh, they signed months ago.

A Goose: (Full Grown Geese walk towards Mordecai, Rigby, and the Baby Ducks) Join us. Become immortalized in plastic and cheap paint!

Rigby: Never!! (Benson and High Five Ghost come out of the house)

Benson: (Angry) I've heard enough!

Mordecai: How'd you hear?

Benson: (It is revealed that Skips, Muscle Man, and Pops followed Benson and HFG. Still angry) You've been yelling this whole time! Just sign the contract and get that cassowary thing outta here!

Rigby: (Squinting at Benson) You too, Benson?

Benson: (Calm) Listen, be sensible! Selling out can be very lucrative. Those toy royalties could really beef up your retirement fund!

Mordecai: No! (Mordecai and Rigby walk over to Benson) You can call us a lot of things. (Counts on fingers) Lazy, slacker, irresponsible. But there is one thing we're not, and that's sell outs. (Both turn toward the businessmen) We're DRAWING a line in the sand! (A baby duck draws a line in the sand. Skips, Pops, HFG, and Muscle Man nod in agreement. Benson is in shock)

Skips: (To the Park crew) I respect that.

Muscle Man: (To Mordecai and Rigby) Nice, bros.

Benson: (Mumbling to himself) They don't get it.

PlayCo Businessman #1: Hmm, looks like we're gonna have to force your hand... (opens briefcase) to SIGN! (Presses red button inside the briefcase. The cassowary launches into the air and turns into a robot. Everyone looks at it)

Skips: Never seen that before. (The Geese turn into a robot as well)

Mega-Goose and the Cassowary: RAAAAAAHHH!!

Mordecai, Rigby and the Baby Ducks: *GASP*

A Baby Duck: Mordecai and Rigby! Remember what to with these? (Raises a fist up) 

Mordecai: (Both raise up a fist) Yes we do.

Benson: No, no, wait a second! Everybody just-! (Gets cut off by Mordecai, Rigby and the Baby Ducks fist pumping. They transform into their outfits and Hyperduck is formed) 

Mordecai and Rigby: Hyperduck Extreme:...!

Hyperduck: ...Fusion Mode! Ready to fight! (Gets into fighting stance. Everything is silent) 

Mega-Goose and the Cassowary: HA HA HA HA HA! Hyperduck Extreme?!? Really?!? That's all you got?!? (The Mega-Goose and the cassowary form together) 

Gooseowary X:  Moto Gooseowary X!

Mordecai and Rigby: (amazed) Wooooooooaaaaaahhh....

Mordecai: (To Rigby) Looks like we're gonna need some help. (Hyperduck points at the Park crew) (Yells) You guys!

Rest of the Park Crew: Huh?

Mordecai: (just voice as Hyperduck makes fist pump motion and raises arms) Pump your fists and help us take a stand against poor aviary merchandise!

Rest of Park Crew: (Music starts playing) Right!

Muscle Man: (Muscle Man and HFG fist pump) HA! (Scene cuts to a waterfall in the middle of a jungle. The waterfall splits and a black tank charges out) 

Muscle Man and High Five Ghost: (Driving the tank) WOOOOOOO! WOO! WOOOOO! WOO! (The tank adds in between Hyperduck's torso)

Skips: (Fist pumps) (Grunts) (Scene cuts to a volcano. It erupts and lava shoots out, along with a jet with the jet rockets looking like the Fists of Justice. Skips is shown driving it) This is pretty wild! (The rocket gloves put themselves on Hyperduck's hands)

Pops: Hahahahaha! (Fist pumps) (Scene cuts to an ocean. A jet that looks like Pops' head emerges from the water. It starts to charge and it zooms forward. On its way, dolphins are riding the waves next to it. Then the Pops Head Jet sheds itself and only the mustache remains. It starts twirling around like a propeller. Pops is shown driving it) Wooooohahahahaha! (It attaches itself onto Hyperduck's bill. Hyperduck mechanically puts on shades and turns its hat around)

Benson: (Annoyed) *Sigh* If it'll get rid of the bird... (Fist pumps) (Scene cuts to a carving of Benson in a mountain. Its mouth opens and a giant clipboard flies out. Benson is shown driving it, screaming really loud) WaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! (It attaches like a shield onto one of Skips' glove rockets. Benson's chair then lowers) Huh? What the-(Him and his chair go through a long tunnel, Benson screaming the whole time) WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! (Then it shows Benson standing on a platform with a light shining above him) Wa? (Half of a sphere thing surrounds his body. Benson tries to get out. As he gets out of some black goo, he is suited up. It also tones his rear, and Benson notices) Oh. (Once he's out, he sees blue lightning around the platform. Then the two halves of the sphere spray him with a cloudy white gas) *Cough, cough, cough* (A chair lifts him into the main control station) Make it stop! *Cough* (It is shown that all of the Park Crew is in the main control room, wearing the same outfit as Benson)

Mordecai:   Alright!   (Scene shows newly upgraded Hyperduck) Hyperduck Extreme: Park Variant! Ready for battle! (Hyperduck Extreme gets into fighting stance)

(Scene cuts to the two machines just standing there, and blue lightning streaks the sky. Petals on plants then show. Rain drops start to land on the petals and stream off of them. It then starts downpouring. Everything is silent for a few moments. The Gooseowary X growls, then starts running towards Hyperduck. It does the same. They punch at the same time, canceling each other out. It stops raining for a bit, then starts downpouring again. Its silent for a few seconds, until Hyperduck advances, but the Gooseowary X knees it. Hyperducks almost falls, but regains composure)

Baby Ducks: La-la-la-... (fires off four Laserdiscs) LASERS! (They hit the Gooseowary X's four heads)

Rigby: In your face! 

Gooseowary X: RAAAAAH!! (Its starts charging at them again)

Park Crew: (Panicking) Aaaahh! (Hyperduck charges as well. They try kicking each other, but they cancel out. They keep doing this, at the same time going higher and higher into the air. They pass clouds and keep going up. The PlayCo businessmen see and decide to help)

PlayCo Businessman #1: (Looks at contract) Hmm... (looks at Neil) looks like we'll need some extra insurance. (They each run into the drivers seat in one of the limos. They turn them on and start flying up into the air. The two machines are still trying to kick each other. The two limos arrive, the machines stop kicking, and the limos attach their rocket jets onto the Gooseowary X's back. The front wheels of the limos stretch out and become steel wings. The cassowary robot head moves from the chest to the head. The four heads come close to each other and the cassowary head takes their place. The metal waddle breaks and a red ribbon streams out, waving like a flag. The Park Crew can't believe it)

Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips: *GASP*

Benson: AH! (The others are speechless. The newly improved Gooseowary X floats for a second, then punches Hyperduck. It takes the machine and flies higher. Scene cuts to Barry and Jones from "Grilled Cheese Deluxe" in a satellite)

Jones: (floats to him) Barry, did you eat all the astronaut ice cream? We only had five left! We're gonna starve! (They see the Gooseowary X fly past the small window) What the-?!?

(Scene cuts to the Gooseowary X flying to the moon. It shoves Hyperduck against the moon's surface, making a soft crashing noise. The Park Crew feels the impact. Hyperduck lays in a newly formed crater, and a crack begins to form, breaking the moon in half)

Skips: Never seen that before.

Muscle Man: Party Mode activate! (Takes out one of his shirts and starts swinging it around so it hits the red "Party Mode" button. Hyperduck gets up and takes off its propeller from its back and starts twirling it around. Using its new speed, it charges toward the Gooseowary X. It brings out a giant metal white rectangle that says "Contract" on it in red. The propeller hits the metal, stopping its spinning)

Neil: This contract is non-negotiable! (Opens a black briefcase and presses a red button saying "Litigation Launch". The "Contract" reveals rockets. The Gooseowary X lets go of the "Contract" and it charges into Hyperduck's stomach. As it moves back, small parts of the moon begin to hit the back of Hyperduck's head. The Park Crew doesn't know what to do. Hyperduck crashes into a half of the moon, the Gooseowary X retrieves the "Contract" using a mechanical grappling hook. With the other hand, the Gooseowary X generates an ink pen and clicks it)

PlayCo Businessmen: Time to close this deal! (The Gooseowary X flies towards the moon with a gun shotting at Hyperduck. Mordecai and Rigby panic.)

Mordecai: Benson, use the Medusa reflection technique!

Benson: The what?!? How?!?

Rigby: (frustrated) Just button mash! You only have one button!

Benson: (sees a red button and joystick and randomly uses them) Aaahh! (Hyperduck then uses the metal clipboard as a shield. Using it, he slowly gets up on his feet again. As the Gooseowary X approaches, it uses its metal wings as a shield and continues advancing. Hyperduck puts its propeller wings on and rockets off the moon. They run into each other)

Gooseowary X: (Pulls out the "contract") Sign the contract! (it punches Hyperduck in the hollow stomach (dumb maneuver), then Hyperduck grabs the Gooseowary X's arm, turns and knees it in the face. The force brings the Gooseowary X towards the moon)

Mordecai and Rigby: Never!

(Hyperduck raises its left arm, the scene cuts to the Great Spinx in Egypt, its head opens, then an electric guitar is flying to Hyperduck, then it uses the guitar to blast the Gooseowary X on the moon repeatedly until it can't move)

Park Crew: (cheering)

Gooseowary X: (laughs evilly as spikes in it starts attaching pieces of the moon on its body)

Park Crew: (gasps as quick closeups of the Gooseowary X with pieces of the moon go up and down repeatedly, then it slowly goes up one more time)

Gooseowary X: Lunar Gooseowary X: Omega Warrior!

Pops: The moon?!? Oh, we can't fight the moon! (The Gooseowary X throws a half piece of the moon to Hyperduck; Mordecai and Rigby are shocked) 

Muscle Man: (also shocked) It's been an honor kicking robot goose butt with you bros.

Hyperduck: Hold on, dudes! (the half piece of the moon hits it and it began to spin and so does the park crew) 

Park Crew: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(The rocket boosters tries to work, but couldn't)

Mordecai: The boosters aren't catching!

Briggs: (voice)  Looks like you need some extra horse power! (He and Briggs are in their flying police car to help Hyperduck) 

Mordecai and Rigby: (excited) Carter and Briggs!

Carter: There's no way we're letting anyone else get stuck with that awful contract!

(Hyperduck starts transforming with two police sirens appeared on his shoulders and the body transforms into a base with Carter and Briggs' car inside)

Carter and Briggs:  (wearing Cruiser Mod Maximum suits)  Hyperduck Extreme: Cruiser Mod Maximum!

Mordecai and Rigby: (wearing the same suits in the main control room with the Park Crew) Alright!

Andy: (voice) Hey, guys, don't go chicken on me now.

Rigby: Who's that? (He and Mordecai see a black square-like space craft on the screen)

Baby Ducks: (one appears on the screen) It's our long lost teenage brother! (others appear on the screen) Andy!

Andy: (while flying in his space craft) I've been studying abroad finding myself. (pulls down his glasses a little) Now I found myself ready to kick some butt!

(Hyperduck starts to transform again, and this time, its propeller transforms into real wings, and Andy in his Fury Gigawing suit) 

Andy: Hyperduck Ultimate Fury Gigawing!         (The word "wing" echos while the scene shows newly upgraded Hyperduck, then the scene zooms out to a PlayCo Focus Testing room)   

PlayCo Tester: So kids, like what you were seeing? Samantha, I noticed your fun-o-meter is stuck in the middle. Why is that?

Samantha: Well, the robots are cool, but weren't there any girls? Why couldn't their long lost brother have been their long lost sister, and how are all of their disparate technologies able to even connect to each other?

PlayCo Tester: (writing on a notepad) "Doesn't like boys, doesn't understand robots."

Samantha: That's... that's not what I said.

(The scene zooms back into space)

Gooseowary X: Sign the contract or be destroyed, Hyperduck!

Mordecai: Then it looks like you'll have to destroy us, 'cause we'd rather die than have our likenesses turn into poorly made toys.

Benson: What? No!

PlayCo Businessman: So be it! Scramble Missiles:...!

Gooseowary X: ...Crisis Spread!
(The scramble misiles appears from the lunar armor. They suddenly shoot out toward the Hyperduck.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Quad-Cannon: Melee Mode!

(They grab handles and push down to release Muscle Man in his Quad-Cannon)

Muscle Man: WHOOOO!!!! AW ha ha, yeah!

(Pops and Benson are also released in their Quad-Cannon positions)

Benson: No, no, no, no, no, no!

Mordecai: Max energy!

Briggs: On it!

(They start doing donuts on their machine)

Andy: Loud and clear! Cerebral screeeeeaaaaaam! AAAAAHHHH!!!

(He uses his cerebral scream power, then the Hyperduck surfs on the guitar and gets off and flies to avoid the missiles as the camera moves around the Hyperduck to Benson firing missiles of the Quad-Cannon at the scramble missiles)

Benson: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! Haha hahahahahahaha!!!

(The camera then moves to Muscle Man firing missiles of his Quad-Cannon position firing the scramble missiles)

Muscle Man: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHOOOOOOO!!!!! Ha ha! WHOOOOO!!!!

Neil: What are we waiting for? Launch the Nega Missile!

PlayCo Business Man:  GRRR!!

(The Nega missile appears on the lunar chest armor and they shoot towards the Hyperduck, which hits the shield, causing it to dissolve the Hyperduck's arm.)

Park Crew: AAAAAHHHH!!!!

Carter and Briggs: AAAAAAHHHHH!!!! (They lost their spin and their cruiser flips)

Andy: (lost his sense of his cerebral scream) AAAAHHH!!! I lost my link, dudes! What's going on?!?

(The Gooseowary X grabs the Hyperduck, then he grabs the other half of the moon and pulls it closer to the Hyperduck and pounds it, then the Gooseowary X gives the pen to the Hyperduck towards the contract and clicks it.)

Gooseowary X:  (chuckles evilly) Face it. You have no choice but to sign the contract.

Park Crew:  (grunting as the main control room start to malfunction)

Mordecai:  NO!

Rigby:  Those toys are so LAME!!!

Skips:  Oooh! Well, I guess immortality had to end sometime.

Neil:  Just accept it. We're a multi-national conglomerate. We can afford to keep hounding you forever! Can you afford new friends?

(The Hyperduck keeps being pounded by the Gooseowary X, and the main control room malfunctions even more)

Pops:  Oh! Too hot! Bad show!

Benson:  Uh... Uh...

Rigby:  I don't wanna almost die on the moon again!

Mordecai: I think... I think we just have to sign it, dude.

(The Hyperduck places the pen on the signature line to sign the contract)

Benson:  Uh... NO!

Mordecai and Rigby:  Huh?

Benson:  You guys taught me something today by putting behind those Quad-Cannons, and it's to always stick to your guns! Don't sign that contract!

Skips, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost:  Hmm!

(The Hyperduck places the pen away from the contract)

Mordecai:  You're right, Benson. At least, this way, we'll go out as the good guys.

A Goose:  Good guys?!? HA HA HA HA HA! HONK! You're the bad guys! The contract even says so! HA HA HA HA HA! HONK!

Rigby:  (reading the contract) Nope, it looks like the contract says you're the bad guys.

Andy:  Aw, dang! You gotta get your eyes checked, dog!

A Goose:  WHAAAAAT?!?

(The PlayCo Business Man and Neil look at each other)

Another Goose:  We never would've said "yes" if we knew we were gonna be the bad guys! YOU LIED TO US!

Neil:  Your robot's black and gray. Of course, you're the bad guys!

A Goose:  If we can't be the good guys, then NO DEAL!

Neil:  No! Wait!

(The Geese leave, then pieces of the moon and the arms detach the Gooseowary X)

PlayCo Business Man:  AAAH!!

(They see pieces of the Gooseowary X heading towards the Hyperduck)

Park Crew:  Uh... AAAH!!!

(Hyperduck starts to transform again, and this time, the pieces start to attach the Hyperduck into a body)

Park Crew:  (wearing white cloths with pink neck ruffs and fancy hats) Hyperduck...!

Baby Ducks and Geese:  ...Kingbreaker...!

Carter, Briggs and Andy:  ...White Lightning! (shows the newly upgraded Hyperduck)

PlayCo Business Man:  Now- Now, hold on! We can negotiate! Fast food deals, movies; apps where you can record your voice and it comes out high-pitched! It's funny! I-It's SYNERGY!

Mordecai:  Synergize this!

(They pull out their guitars and they play them as the old Hyperduck paddle and new Hyperduck starts to energize a ball)

Narrator:  Mordecai, Rigby and their friends summon the Galaxy Blade from a distant moon!

(From a distant moon, the Galaxy Blade flies out of a temple as it flies into space, flies through Mars, which gets destroyed by it, and lands in the Hyperduck's hands. The Hyperduck uses the Galaxy Blade to cut the contract and it uses its arm on the Gooseowary X as they fly down back to Earth)

Hyperduck:  STEP OFF!

PLayCo Business Man and Neil:  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

(The Hyperduck flies down towards the Park to crush the Gooseowary X as outside the city, a doe watches, and the Hyperduck slams down the Gooseowary X causing a massive explosion, destroying the house, Cheezers, the ocean current, the city and the entire Earth. We cut to the now-destroyed Park)

Narrator:  The Galaxy Blade can only be reeled to by those who can show true friendship and courage in the face of overwhelming odds. Is this the end for our intrepid heroes? (The camera pans to a crater) Wait, look! In that crater! Could it be? Could it be?

(Benson gets out of the crater)

Benson:  That... was... amazing! (Mordecai and Rigby get out of the crater) I've never felt alive! I don't even care if the Park was destroyed! You guys feel like this all the time?

Mordecai:  Yeah, pretty much.

(The Baby Ducks, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man, Fives, Carter and Briggs walk up to them)

Carter:  Hey, thanks for getting us out of that contract.

Briggs:  Yeah, now I can finally sleep soundly in my eight-million dollar mansion.

A Baby Duck:  I'm just glad we're all safe. Wait, where's Andy?

(They look up on Andy's space craft)

Andy:  Gotta jet, dudes! I've got a hot date on Europa! It's been real! (He flies to Europa)

Pops:  Oh, what a nice fellow.

(The Geese come up to the Baby Ducks)

A Goose:  Thanks for helping us, Ducks. We are mortal enemies, but just this once, we were comrades, and that was pretty cool. (Places his wing)

(A Baby Ducks places his wing closer and swipes it)

A Baby Duck:  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH!!!!! I really thank you.

(The Baby Ducks and the Geese shake wings)

Baby Ducks:  That was great. That was cool.

Geese:  Sure is. That was great. Yeah, that was great.

(The PlayCo Business Man and Neil climb out of the crater)

PlayCo Business Man:  Okay, fine. No toys. That's cool. But have you ever considered video games?

Mordecai: Sure, why not?

Rigby:  Oh, yeah, totally.

Baby Ducks:  Definitely. Uh-huh.

Mordecai:  There's no such thing as a bad video game.

(The guys jump in the air shouting "YEAH!!!" The words "Executive Producer: J.G. Quintel" is shown. We are then shown to several scenes such as: at the Baby Ducks' place where Mordecai, Rigby and the Baby Ducks are partying, Pops, Benson, two Baby Ducks and Skips waiting for Mordecai and Rigby to ride with them, the Baby Ducks eating dinner while the Mother Duck is cooking, the Baby Ducks on a stegosaurus battling a Tyrannosaurus Rex with machine guns in the prehistoric times while Mordecai and Rigby use a map, Mordecai, Rigby and the Baby Ducks look at the stars to see an image of Andy on it, and the size comparison chart of the Hyperducks, the Mega-Goose, the cassowary, the Gooseowary X's, and the characters' mechs. We fade out. Episode ends.)

(The episode begins at the park. Mordecai and Rigby are up to their old antics, as usual. This time, they're ready to do some stunts with the cart)

Mordecai: Alright, dude, are you ready?

Rigby: I finished digging the pit, and the cones are all set up!

Mordecai: Extreme cartin'?

Rigby: Extreme cartin'!

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAAA!

(M&R shuffle into the car, and they start it up. Mordecai steps on the gas, then, grabs the gear, and the car goes down the hill. They fly through the air in the car, and Mordecai turns the car in midair to land on a metal rail. They skid for a while, holding the poles of the car)

Mordecai: Hold it, hold it!

Rigby: I'm holding, I'm holding!

Mordecai: (steps on brake) Now!

(M&R let go of the poles. As the car jumps off the rail, Mordecai spins the wheel causing the car to do a three sixty. When the car lands, Mordecai skids through the scatter of cones, then switches gears, and the car flies into the air and lands in a big circular hole. Mordecai makes the car rotate along the outer rim of the hole for a couple rotations. The car then flies into the air, does another three sixty, and lands on the top of another hill. Mordecai hits the brake, then, M&R start panting, and, though still left breathless from all of what happened, they laugh)

Rigby: Hahaha, we did it, we did it!

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

(they high-five. Then, all of a sudden, the car starts rolling down the hill. At the bottom, Mr. Maellard is walking with Benson, examining the park)

Mr. Maellard: Hmm. Hmph! Yup, the ground keep on the grounds looks excellent. This park is really coming together. Well done, Benson.

(Benson and Mr. Maellard see the car, still rolling on its own. M&R run behind to try to stop the car, which crashes into the tree as Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Maellard look on)

Benson: (enraged) Mordecai, Rigby! What have I told you about messing with the cart? If you think-- (Mr. Maellard puts his hand on Benson's shoulder)

Mr. Maellard: My office. Now. (clock transition to Mr. Maellard's office. Maellard is chewing Benson out) Do you have any idea how much those carts COST?! (pounds on table) I'm not paying park money to fix your mistakes!

Benson: But, sir--

Mr. Maellard: But nothing! (M&R listen outside of the office) I could find a new park manager right now if I wanted to.

Benson: (pulls out receipt) Don't worry, sir. The warranty will take care of everything. (Maellard yanks the receipt and looks at it)

Mr. Maellard: This expires tomorrow afternoon!

Benson: But the dealership's too far away! I'll have to drive all day and night.

Mr. Maellard: Sounds like a personal problem. Get that cart fixed or you're FIRED!

(cut to a few seconds later. Maellard slams the door on Benson. Outside, Benson walks out, still steamed, as M&R follow)

Mordecai: Benson, we're sorry. We'll make it up to you.

Rigby: Yeah, we can help you get to the dealership!

Benson: (turns to M&R) No, you two only screw things up! I am getting that cart fixed by myself, so stay here.

Mordecai: But that drive is way too long for one person to handle!

Benson: I'll take my chances. (clock transition to a montage of Benson out on the road in . The crashed car lays in the bed of the truck once it clears up, his monitor flashes to turn right, and he goes in that direction. Benson drives through the canyon through sun, rain and fog before he stops at a gas station. Benson then drives the truck across the bridge as the montage ends. He passes by a sign reads, "Cart Dealership, 1000 miles") Alright, Benson. (checks watch) You're making great time. (focuses back on the road) As long as you don't stop, you can get to the dealership with time to spare. (looks in rear-view mirror) And then, as soon as you get back to the park, you can fire... (Benson sees Mordecai and Rigby as they peep their heads into view from the car)...(slowly) Mordecai and RIGBY?!?! ARGH! (hits the brake. Seconds later, Benson is yelling at M&R outside of the truck) I can't believe this! I thought I told you idiots not to come! Does the word "not" not process into your thick skulls?!

Rigby: Of course not! Wait, uh...

Mordecai: Look, Benson, we just wanted to help you make it across the country!

Benson: Shut up! Just shut up and let me think for a second. (sighs and pauses for a few moments) Okay. Ideally, you guys would be a million miles away from me now. But since I don't have time to turn around and take you back, you're gonna come with me... (zoom into face) and you're gonna do exactly what I say. (cut to some time later. Benson is giving one-word commands to M&R on what to do) Water. (M&R grabs the water from a shelf) Open. (M&R force the cap off) Mouth. (M&R try to pour it into Benson's mouth, but the truck runs over a rock, causing the water to spill on Benson) Argh! Napkins! (M&R get a pack of napkins from the shelf. Not seeing the twistie, Rigby tries to rip the bag open, but the bag rips open, blinding Benson) No napkins, no napkins!

(some time later, a police car has pulled Benson over. Benson walks slowly, seemingly drunk, to the police man. Clock transition to MR&B back in the truck)

Mordecai: Benson, we're sorry.

Rigby: Yeah, the bag wouldn't open and the napkins--

Benson: No, no more! Here's what you guys are gonna do for the rest of the trip--Nothing! Absolutely nothing! Don't say anything, don't do anything. Just stop messing things up!

(short pause)

Rigby: Benson, why do you hate us so much?

Benson: (sighs, in a calmer tone) I don't hate you guys, I just hate some of the things you do. (pause) Okay, I really hate some of the things you do. I know you don't mean them, but I'm your boss, and it's my job to push you to do better.

Mordecai: Is that why Maellard yells at you?

Benson: (laughs) You guys don't know how easy you have it. Let's just say his yelling is way worse than mine.

Rigby: But is it worse than his face?

(MR&B laugh)

Mordecai: His face.

Benson: (pulls out a tape) Hey, do you guys want to listen to some electropop music?

Mordecai: Whoa! you listen to that?

Benson: Just on long car trips. It helps keep me awake.

(Benson puts the tape into the radio and electronic pop music starts to play. They start to dance, causing them to swerve and then stop on the roadside with another police car, and the police man dances with them. We then cut to the night. The music ends as Benson is seen falling asleep)

Mordecai: Benson?

(Benson is still falling asleep)

Mordecai: Hey, Benson?

(Benson wakes up)

Benson: Huh? what?

Mordecai: Dude, you look pretty tired. How about I drive for a little while?

Benson: No, no. I'm perfectly fine.

Rigby: Come on, man. You've been driving all day! It's not safe.

Benson: (sighs) Alright. (Benson pulls on the side of the road. Then, he and Mordecai get out of the truck to switch their seats) I don't wanna sleep for too long, so wake me up in two hours. Only two hours. got it?

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. You can trust us.

(Cut to some time later. Benson is sleeping in what used to be Mordecai's seat as the latter drives) 

Mordecai: Check the map to see how much further it is.

Rigby: (pulls out map) Where are we now?

Mordecai: Uh... (laughs upon seeing a road sign that reads "Now Entering Buttzland") Buttzland.

Rigby: Buttzland? (laughs) Dude, we're really close to the dealership! (points to spot on the map) It's like only two inches away.

Mordecai: Dude. look, dude. (From Mordecai's point of view, we see another road sign that reads, "JoySpot Arcade, next exit") You thinking what I'm thinking?

Mordecai and Rigby: Video game pit stop! WOOOAAHHH-- (Benson is almost woken up) (Quietly) Woooaahhh...

(They leave the exit and go to Joyspot Arcade and run to the doors)

Mordecai: All right, let's do this, But only for thirty minutes. Benson's job is on the line.

Rigby: Right.

(They go into the arcade and it goes to...well, several hours later, and Benson wakes up)

Benson: (yawns and looks at his watch) Huh? What? (Benson runs into the arcade and finds Mordecai and Rigby playing a game and takes them outside)

Rigby: Turn it off!

Mordecai: How long were we in there?

Benson: (goes red) HOURS! You were in there for HOURS! Now we're never gonna make it to the DEALERSHIP in time! It closes in 30 MINUTES!

Mordecai: We're sorry. We didn't know it was daytime, there aren't any windows in the arcade.

Benson: Excuses, excuses! How am I supposed to trust you when all you give me are EXCUSES?! When are you two gonna learn that your actions have consequences?! Consequences that affect other people, (voice breaking) like me... Don't you two understand? I'm about to lose my job... You may not care about keeping your jobs, but I care about keeping mine, cause if I lose my job, I have nothing. Do you hear me? I have nothing! (He buries his face in his hands and sobs) Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take my last bathroom break as an employed man. (walks to a bathroom)

Mordecai: Dude, we really messed up.

(A few moments later)

Benson: (comes out of the bathroom) What? (sees that the truck is gone, screams with rage, pants, and turns red then sees a guy with a motorcycle) Hey, you! (runs to the guy) There were two guys with a truck that were just here. Do you know where they went?

Hillbilly: Oh yeah. They're taking a shortcut out to Highway 13 to the cart dealership.

Benson: What?!

Hillbilly: Most dangerous highway in the country.

Benson: How much do you want for that bike? (Cuts to some time later.  Benson is riding the motorcycle onto Highway 13, catches up to the truck, jumps off the motorcycle, crashing it, leaps onto the car in the truck and opens the window of the truck) You idiots! That is the most dangerous highway in the country!

Mordecai: But it's the only way to make it to the dealership in time.

Benson: Get out of that driver's seat! (Mordecai moves to the middle seat and Benson sits on the driver seat) I am turning this thing around.

(They drive over a bridge which breaks and the ground begins to crumble)

Rigby: Guys, I don't think we can turn around.

(Benson and Mordecai see this in the rear-view mirror and scream)

Mordecai: Step on it! Step on it! (Benson speeds up) Benson, watch out! (Points to the spikes on the road ahead and Benson tries to swerve away from them but two spikes pop up, slashing off the rear tires, and they drive towards a canyon and a boulder is seen coming down the side)

Rigby: Boulder!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson scream, swerve away from the boulder then the two front tires explode and they scream again)

Benson: (shaking, panicked) We're all gonna die!

Mordecai: No we're not. We can fix this Benson. Rigby, you ready for some extreme cartin'?

Rigby: Extreme cartin'!

(They unhook the straps that hold the back of the truck and holding the cart then Mordecai and Rigby get into the cart)

Mordecai: Hold on. (Mordecai steps on the brake until the cart falls off Benson's truck, then speeds back up to it and hooks the strap on the car) Take the wheel. (While Mordecai tries to hook the strap onto Benson's truck, Rigby screams to attract Mordecai's attention to the boulders hurling towards them and slides the cart to the side and successfully hooks the strap onto Benson's truck ) Hang on, Benson! (Mordecai speeds up the car until it is in front of the truck and jumps over a large gap and does the "extreme cartin'" trick like in the beginning of the episode) Hold it! Hold it!

Mordecai and Rigby: AHHHH!

(Mordecai makes a few turns with the crashed cart and jumps into a giant hole which he grinds the cart around it a few times until the cart flies into the air with built-up speed. Mordecai and Rigby scream throughout the process and finally make it back to land. They make it to a road closed sign. Although they were whimpering, the cart breaks through the sign and into the sky with lightning flashing)

Mordecai, Rigby and Benson: (in slow motion) WHOOOOOOA! (reverts back to normal speed when they are about to land) AHHHH!

(They finally make it through Highway 13 with clearing skies. They are about to get to the cart dealership)

Rigby: (weakly) Look. The dealership.

Mordecai: (weakly) We're almost there.

(At the cart dealership, there are two workers that are yearning for their job to be over)

Cart Dealership Employee # 1: Dude, its closing time, dude.

Cart Dealership Employee # 2: Yes! (The first employee tosses a key to the second employee) Dude, countdown! Countdown!

Both employees: 10,9,8,7--

(zooms back to Benson's truck)

Benson: We're gonna crash! Pull the parking brake!

Mordecai: (gasps) Parking brake!

(Mordecai pulls the e-brake)

Both: 3.....2.....1--

(The employees see the crashed car up ahead)

Cart Dealership Employee # 2: Huh?

(the cart slows down to a stop)

Mordecai and Rigby: (groaning in pain)

Mordecai:(weakly) Hey...are you guys still open?

Cart Dealership Employee # 2: Let me guess, last day on the warranty?

(The top of the cart falls in) 

(Clock transition to a ambulance. The paramedic closes the door, and the ambulance drives to the hospital. Inside, Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson are on stretchers and there are black belts around them so they won't fall off. The three of them have bandages on them, and Mordecai has a cast on his broken arm, and Benson has one on his broken wrist.)

Mordecai: Well Benson, at least we got the cart to the dealership.

Benson: Yeah, but the truck is totaled.

Rigby: When does the warranty on the truck expire?

Mordecai and Rigby: ROAD TRIIIIIP!

(End of "Busted Cart")

(Episode begins with Mordecai picking up garbage off the living room floor while Rigby is sitting on the couch, playing with Mordecai's cell phone.)

Mordecai: Man last night was the best. The best.

Rigby (while tapping on the keys of Mordecai's phone): Yeah, it was pretty fun.

Mordecai: I mean, Margaret and Eileen over for "Game Night", and nothing went wrong. No space portals, no video demons, nobody got hurt.

Rigby: Except for Eileen and I whipping your butts.

Mordecai: Whatever, I had fun. Dude, come on, help out. Benson's not going to let us have people over anymore if we leave this place a mess. And put down my new phone before you break it.

Rigby: Ok, just a sec. I'm making you a new custom wallpaper.

(The wallpaper shows Mordecai getting flushed down a toilet and says "Captain Toilet", "Loser", while Rigby laughs. Mordecai is displeased, and groans. The scene then transitions with Mordecai and Rigby outside the house, putting all the trash bags to the cart.)

Mordecai: All right, I'm going to take this stuff to dump.

Rigby: Heh. You mean you're going take that trash to your face.

(Mordecai gives a fake laugh)

Mordecai: ... and gimme my phone.

(Mordecai snatches the phone from Rigby's hands)

Mordecai: You're lucky I'm in a good mood from last night.

(Mordecai sets the phone next to him on the seat of the cart, and then drives off.)

Rigby: Hmm hmm. Hmm!

(The scene then transitions to Mordecai driving to the dump. All of the sudden, a song about Margaret pops into his brain)

Mordecai: Doo doo doo! A-hanging with Margaret just-a feels so good like I knew it would. Laughing together and-a having a blast. And I hope it lasts forever. I can't believe how hot she is. Makes my insides feel like knotted twists. Her pretty face and those long, long legs, and I hope someday we are more than just friends! (long pause). Oh, Margaret. Oh Margaret! I love it when you stand or sit right next to me. Can't you see? Your future with me is brighter than the ocean... What? "Brighter than the ocean?"

Operator: If you are satisfied with your message, press 1.

Mordecai: Huh?

Operator: To delete or re-record your message, press 2.

(Mordecai slams the breaks on the cart so hard, it causes the back end of the cart to go up in the air)

Mordecai: No! No! No! Delete! delete! Delete!

Operator: Message sent. Goodbye.

Mordecai: Oh, my...

(The scene cuts off to the next scene, Mordecai, who is driving at full speed back to the house)

Mordecai: Rigby! Dude, its over! She's never gonna talk to me again!

Rigby: Who?

Mordecai: Margaret! I was singing about her in the cart, and it recorded it to her voicemail!

Rigby: Why did you call her in the first place?

Mordecai: I sat on my phone. It was an accident!

Rigby: You butt dialed her?

(Rigby laughs hysterically at his horrible mistake. Mordecai then sits on the steps of the porch in dissapointment, with his eyes covered beneath his hands)

Mordecai: She must think I'm a total loser!

Rigby: Come on! It can't be THAT bad!

Mordecai (still with his eyes covered with his hands): I sang a song about how hot she was, and how I wanted us to be together forever.

Rigby: Okay, that's really bad. But we can fix it! (Rigby takes Mordecai's phone, and starts tapping on the keypad) I'll just call her, and say the message was for someone else!

(The phone starts calling up Margaret. Mordecai takes the phone from Rigby)

Mordecai: Dude, no! That'll make it even worse!

Margaret: Hi, this is Margaret...

Mordecai: Oh, hey Margaret.

Margaret: I'm at work right now, so leave a message after the beep.

(The phone beeps, and Mordecai hangs up)

Mordecai: She's still at work.

Rigby: Which means she hasn't checked her voicemail yet!

Mordecai: Dude... we have to get to her phone and erase that message.

(The scene transitions to Mordecai and Rigby slamming the breaks on the cart in front of The Coffee Shop, right in back of Margaret's car. They jump out and peer through the window. Meanwhile, rock music is playing in the background)

Mordecai: Okay, there she is.

Mordecai and Rigby: *gasp* Oh no!

(Margaret picks up a cell phone, looks at it, and then puts it down on a table)

Rigby: Oooooh! Burned! She saw that you left a message, and didn't even CHECK it! That's cold, man.

Mordecai: Shut up. (Mordecai and Rigby turn away from the window, and discuss the plan) Okay, I'll go in and start talking to her. You go in through the side, go underneath the table behind her, and swipe her phone.

Rigby: Love it! (Rigby looks at his hands) These hands were MADE for swiping!

(Mordecai goes inside, and runs down the staircase)

Mordecai: Margaret!

Margaret: Oh, hey Mordecai! How's it going?

Mordecai: Oh, you know. Good.

(Mordecai overlooks Margaret to see Rigby entering through the side)

Mordecai: Goooooood...

Margaret: Hey, I had a really fun time last night.

Mordecai: Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah yeah! Me too!

Margaret: Yeah, I thought we made a good team, you and me.

(The camera then focuses on Rigby, unsucessfully trying to swipe the phone from underneath the table)

Mordecai: Uh huh?

Margaret: We should do it again soon! Or, you know, it doesn't have to be a game night necessarily, with other people, or anything. It could be... whatever. (By the sound of it, Margaret wants to spend time with Mordecai alone, possibly increasing the relationship between the two)

Mordecai: Yeah, right. RIGHT! (Mordecai puts an emphasis on the second "right" to direct Rigby where the phone is, since Rigby is underneath the table and can't see)

Margaret: Righhhhht... Well, just let me know. I'm pretty much up for anything. (The phone starts ringing. Mordecai now has a nervous expression on his face) Sorry! (Mordecai is so scared that he slaps Margaret's hand, causing the phone to fly through the air) HEY! (The phone lands in a coffee mug full of coffee, causing sparks to come out of the phone. The phone then smokes, and then sinks further into the coffee) Dude! What are you doing?!

Mordecai: There was a bug!

Margaret: What?!

(Rigby comes out from under the table)

Rigby: I got it!

(Rigby takes the coffee-soaked phone out of the coffee mug)

Margaret: Rigby! Where did you-

Eileen: Oh no! My phone!

Mordecai: Wait, YOUR phone?!

Margaret: Yeah, Eileen told me to watch for calls while she was in the bathroom.

Rigby (to Eileen): Oh, here.

(Rigby gives Eileen the coffee-soaked phone)

Eileen: Gee, thanks...

Mordecai: Wait, so, can I borrow YOUR phone then?

Margaret: Oh, I don't know where I left it. Maybe in my car, or something? I can go check if you want.

Mordecai: Oh, no no! We can get it. You're still working and all, so...

Rigby: Yeah, give us the keys!

(Margaret gives Mordecai the keys to her car)

Margaret: Okay, that's cool. I'm almost done with my shift, so I'll just meet you out there.

Mordecai: Cool! (The scene then transitions to a musical montage of Mordecai and Rigby searching frantically for Margaret's phone in her car. At one point, Rigby finds a "Fist Pump" CD, referencing "Caffinated Concert Tickets", where Margaret made her debut. Without any luck, they cannot find the phone) Aw! It's gotta be in here somewhere!

Rigby: Dude, just butt dial her phone again, and then we can hear where it's ringing from!

Mordecai: Dude, shut... Actually, that's a good idea! (Mordecai dials Margaret's cell phone number on his phone)It's ringing. Do you hear it?

(Mordecai and Rigby look around, but can't find it. The phone picks up)

Pops: Helloooooo?

Mordecai: POPS?!

(The scene transitions to Pops, who is sitting on the couch at the house eating a creamsicle)

Pops: Mordecai, hello! I was just eating this frozen ice lolly, when all of the sudden, this magical telephone thing started ringing!

Mordecai (still in Margaret's car): Margaret must have left her phone at the house last night!

Rigby: Ask him what flavor he is eating!

Mordecai: Pops, stay where you are, don't move, got it?

Pops: Oooh, I love this game!

(Pops stays completely still while his creamsicle is melting. Meanwhile, the scene transitions to Mordecai and Rigby outside Margaret's car)

Mordecai: Okay, we need to get back to the house before-

(Margaret interrupts the two)

Margaret: Hey guys! Did you find my phone?

Mordecai: Uhhh...

Rigby: Yeah, back at the house!

(Mordecai punches Rigby in the back)

Rigby: OW!

Margaret: Great! I'll go pick it up!

Mordecai: No! We can get it for you! I mean, the park is so far out of your way!

Margaret: No, I don't mind. Besides, I'm the one that left it there!

Mordecai: Fine. Heh heh. We'll see you there!

(Mordecai drags Rigby with him, and dashes to the cart)

Margaret: Okay, I'll see you... (Mordecai does a donut with the cart, and peels out of the street, and around the corner, leaving Margaret) ... there?

(Margaret is now suspicious. Meanwhile, Mordecai and Rigby are driving the cart at full speed trying to get to the house as fast as possible before Margaret arrives.)

Rigby (while holding on to the hood of the cart): Dude! Slow down!

Mordecai (while driving): No, she can't hear that message!

Rigby: Then take the shortcut! (Rigby points to his left)

(Mordecai drives the cart off an embankment, and drops down to the dirt road below. He then drives full speed over the bridge over the river, flying through the air, and then uses the restroom roof as a ramp to get back on the ground, tearing the shackles off the roof in the process. Mordecai then jumps a hill, flying through the air again, and then lands in the driveway of the house. They then charge into the house, and swipe the phone from Pops, still sitting on the couch with his creamsicle completely melted.)

Mordecai: Thanks Pops!

Telephone Operator: One new voice message. Please input password.

Mordecai and Rigby: PASSWORD?!

Mordecai: Uhhhh, Coffee!

(Mordecai enters "COFFEE" into the phone. It is incorrect.)

Telephone Operator: Incorrect. You have one more attempt.

(Mordecai and Rigby gasp, as they look out the window to see Margaret pulling into the driveway in her car)

Rigby: Dude, hurry!

Mordecai: Uhhhhh... what could it be?!

Rigby: Music! She likes Fist Pump!

(Mordecai enters "FISTPUMP" into the phone. Once again, it is incorrect.)

Telephone Operator: Incorrect. You have no more attempts. Any further attempts will be penalized.

(Mordecai and Rigby grunt. Meanwhile, Margaret is coming out of her car)

Rigby: Dude! She's almost here! Try something!

Mordecai: Uhhhhhh...

(Mordecai types in "MORDECAI". Unfortunately, it is incorrect once again)

Telephone Operator: Too many attempts. You will now be penalized.

Rigby: Wait, what?

(Mordecai and Rigby, then get sucked into the phone)

Pops: Did I win?

(Mordecai and Rigby get pixelated, and are being transported to somewhere, screaming of course. Then they landedin the Virtual Messaging Control Center)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ughhhh...

Answering Machine: Get up.

Mordecai: What the? Where are we?

Answering Machine: You have landed in the Virtual Messaging Control Center. We are the keepers of the voice mail. Guardians of all messages throughout history.

(Spotlights shine on five objects, who are apparently characters. These characters include Smoke Signal (who is a blanket over fire), a message in a bottle, an answering machine, a spool of thread, and a chalkboard)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoaaaaaa...

Answering Machine: Because of your excessive attempts, you have violated password law, and you are charged for trying to hack into someone's account.

Mordecai: What?! I didn't think that warning was real!

Answering Machine: Oh, it's very real!

Smoke Signal: Burn them! Burn them!

Answering Machine: Settle down, we're not going to burn them. Since when have we burned anybody? (Smoke Signal lets out a puff of smoke in dissapointment) We will erase them... from existence.

(Answering Machine takes out film from a tape in his mouth, and is ready to hit the "Erase" button on his body)

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

(Meanwhile, Margaret is knocking at the door. Pops then answers)

Pops: Oh, Margaret, hello!

Margaret: Hey Pops! I came to pick up my phone.

Pops: Oh, so it was YOUR phone that Mordecai and Rigby got sucked into?

Margaret: Surrrrrrrre.... so, have you seen my phone?

Pops: Yes, come in, come in!

(The camera then focuses on Mordecai and Rigby, still trapped in the Virtual Messaging Control Center)

Mordecai and Rigby: Wait, wait, wait, wait!

Mordecai: We can explain!

Answering Machine: Proceed with your message.

Mordecai: Okay, so I accidentally recorded this message on a girl, Margaret's phone.

Rigby: Yeah, and we were just trying to delete it before she heard it!

Spool of Thread: But why not let this person hear the message?

Rigby: Because HE'LL die of embarrassment!

Spool of Thread: Embarrassment?

Mordecai: Yeah, look. Margaret and I have a really complicated relationship.

Spool of Thread: Relationship?

Mordecai: Aw! We don't have time for this! Can you please delete the message?

(The scene goes back to Margaret and Pops)

Pops: It's over there!

Margaret: Thanks, Pops! (Margaret picks up the phone off the ground. Phone makes beep noise) Oh, hey. I have a message!

(Margaret goes for the "Open" command. Meanwhile back at the VMCC, Mordecai and Rigby hear a beeping noise)

Spool of Thread: Someone is accessing the voice mail system.

Mordecai: Oh no. Please, I'm begging you, please delete that message!

Telephone Operator: Input Password.

(Margaret punches in the password, showing that "DADDYS GIRL" was the correct password)

Rigby: Hm hm. Saw that one coming.

Answering Machine: Phone user!

Margaret: Uh, yes? Who is this?<

Answering Machine: We intercepted two frauds trying to access your voicemail without your permission.

Spool of Thread: The one who claims to have a complicated relationship with you.

Mordecai: Don't listen to them, Margaret!

Rigby: Yeah, these guys are crazy!

Margaret: Mordecai? Rigby? Wait, you tried to hack into my phone?!

Mordecai: It was an accident! We didn't know it was YOUR phone!

Margaret: Yeah, right!

Mordecai: Well, we did know, but...

Margaret: But what? I can't believe you would do something like that! I TOTALLY misjudged you!

Rigby: Dude, just come clean already.

(Mordecai grunts)

Mordecai: Okay, look. So I sat on my phone, and accidentally-

Rigby: He called you with his butt! (Rigby grins)

Mordecai: Yeah. So I accidentally left you a voicemail with me singing this dumb song. (Mordecai is scratching his neck) It is really embarrassing. So we tried to erase it before you heard it.

Margaret: You what? I want to hear the message!

Mordecai: Wait, Margaret! Please!

Margaret: No, I want to hear it.

Answering Machine: Play the message!

Telephone Operator: New message.

Mordecai (in the message): A-hanging with Margaret just-a feels so good like I knew it would. Laughing together and-a having a blast. And I hope it lasts forever!

(Mordecai facepalms)

Mordecai: Oh, please!

(The camera now goes back to Margaret and Pops. Pops has a shocked expression on his face since he is hearing this)

Mordecai (in the message): I can't believe how hot she is! Makes my insides feel like knotted twists! (Pops drops down to the ground, disgusted about what he heard. Going back to Mordecai and Rigby, Mordecai has his hands over his face. Rigby has a disgusted face) Her pretty face and those long, long legs. And I hope someday, we are more than just friends!

Rigby: Eugh! It's worse than I thought!

Mordecai: Shut up!

(Everybody of the VMCC is grooving to the message)

Mordecai (in the message): Oh, Margaret. Oh, Margaret. Do you remember last night when our hands touched? We were grabbing for the dice and you were laughing and such...

Spool of Thread: Not bad!

(Chalkboard writes "CATCHY")

Mordecai (in the message): Take one role, then take a chance on me. And maybe then you'll see how perfect we can be. Together you and me for all eternity!

(Mordecai is covering his ears)

Mordecai: Euugh! Could you please just erase me?


Mordecai (in the message): Okay. Maybe that's a long, long time. But a guy can dream, can't I?

(Margaret pauses the message, and laughs hysterically)

Margaret: Okay, stop! I heard enough! (Margaret laughs again) Like knotted twists?! (Margaret laughs) That's TOO good! (Margaret laughs)

Rigby: At least she doesn't hate you!

Answering Machine: Would you like us to erase these hackers now?

Margaret: Hmmm... nah. I think they learned their lesson!

Answering Machine: Very well. You're free to go. (a door with an "EXIT" sign comes out of the ground. Mordecai and Rigby smile looking at their way out, but then, the Answering Machine talks to them again. They then turn around at him) But you could stay if you'd like. We're thinking of forming a band!

Mordecai: Oh, yeah, we'll give you a call.

Answering Machine: Cool, just leave a message, and we'll get it. (Mordecai and Rigby leave) Oh wait. I didn't give them my number...

(Mordecai and Rigby drop on the ground out of the phone. They are grunting in pain.)

Pops: Hooray! Good show!

Rigby: Hey. HEY! We made it! Thanks, Margaret!

Margaret: No problem!

Mordecai: Yeah, thanks Margaret!

Margaret: Sure thing!

(There is a moment of silence. Rigby looks around with his eyes half closed.)

Rigby: Hey, Pops. I need to show you something in the other room. (He could possibly be making up an excuse so Mordecai and Margaret can talk in private)

Pops: Oooh! I love being shown things!

(The two leave the room)

Mordecai: So, heh.

Margaret: So.

Mordecai: So, you could go ahead and delete the message now.

Margaret: Oh, no! That song is WAY to good to lose!

Mordecai: What? Come on!

Margaret: No actually, I'm going to set it to be your personal ringtone.

Mordecai: You're kidding, right?

Margaret: Nope. That way I can hear you singing every time you call me. So you better call me.

(Margaret walks away)

Mordecai: Oh. Uh, okay! I'll try to use my fingers next time, and not my butt! (Margaret slams the door) Rad.

(episode ends)

(The episode begins with the park workers are all in the living room.) 

Benson: (Runs through with choices for game night.) Ahem. Alright. The options for this month's game night are: (reads list) checkers, cards, Double Dutch, Tiddly Winks and-- (pauses) "My Mom" isn't a game, Muscle Man. That doesn't even make sense.

Muscle Man: Looks like I win! (high fives Hi Five Ghost)

Pops: Let's play Ball-bo Catcher! (plays with the Ball-Bo Catcher and laughs)

Skips: A crossword puzzle?

Benson: Okay, let's vote. (Mordecai yawns) Yes, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Oh, nothing.

Benson: Do you have a better idea?

Mordecai: We could play one of those stale old games we usually play.

Rigby: Or we could play the sci-fi fantasy epic of the century! (holds up game box) Behold, The Realm of Darthon!

(Mordecai waves his arms while vocalizing)

Benson: So, what is it?

Mordecai: It's a role-playing game. We make up an adventure and you guys try to beat it.

Rigby: You can use magic and stuff.

Pops: A game of imagination? What fun!

Muscle Man: Sounds lame.

Rigby: No way,

Mordecai: The guy at the store told us it's the hottest RPG of the year.

Benson: (sighs) All in favor?

(everyone else but Skips agrees)

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOOOOO! Darthon! Darthon! (high-five) WHOOOOO!

Rigby: Get ready for the best game night of your life.

(The scene then cuts to the kitchen. The park workers are all playing Realm of Darthon.)

Mordecai: Your party walks down a long hallway and reaches a locked door. What do you do?

Muscle Man: I smash it open with my war claw! Then, a bunch of ladies come out, and they're all, "Ooh Muscle Man, quit pinching my butt with your war claw!"

Rigby: Roll the 50-sided die to see if you unlock the door.

Skips: (looks at the die and marbles) All we have is a 48-sided die and two marbles.

Rigby: Close enough.

(Muscle Man rolls the die and marbles... only for all of them to roll off the table.)

Muscle Man: Did it work?'

Rigby: (looks at chart) Uhhh... I don't think so.

Muscle Man: This blows.

Pops: (waving hand) Mordecai! Mordecai! (in western accent) But I'll reckon I'd like a turn now!

Mordecai: (looking at book) Cyborg cowboys take three days to awaken from hypersleep. Sorry, Pops.

(Pops moans)

Skips: Can't he cast a saving throw?

Mordecai: Uhhh...

Benson: What does all this stuff mean? Are we even in Darthon yet? (Mordecai flips through the book, moaning) Or is that just an artifact for something?

Mordecai: (flips through book, then quickly closes it) Uhhh... your party is suddenly ambushed by a flock of manbats! Skips the Mighty gets first strike! (Skips rolls the dice and marbles)

Rigby: Let's see... (calculates) Pirate samurai have plus two times two shen... minus three charisma... divide by number of geese... Do we have a protractor?

Benson: I'm outta here.

(All of the park workers, except for M&R, get up and walk away)

Muscle Man: Worst game night ever!

Rigby: (moans) Dude, they're right! (knocks away stand) This game sucks!

Mordecai: Let's get our money back.

The scene then cuts to to Comics Plus and More, etc. There's a long line of people standing in front of the store. Mordecai and Rigby (the duo) walk past the crowd to get to the front)

Rigby: Out of the way! Out of the way, everybody!

Mordecai: Coming through, coming through!

Rigby: Out of the way! Out of the way people!

(they've reached the front of the line)

Mordecai: We're here for a refund.

Clerk: I'd love to give you a refund, but you need a receipt for that.

Rigby: I got a receipt right here. (slaps receipt onto the table)

Clerk: Excellent. And now the unopened product?

Mordecai: What?! You can't return it if it's opened?!

Clerk: Well, yes! It's clearly stated on the back of your receipt.

Rigby: What?! That's lame! You can barely even see the writing!

Clerk: Yes, well, perhaps if you learned to read, it would be easy for you to see. Good day, gentlemen!

Rigby: Dude, just give us our money back. This game blows! (pounds on table)

Clerk: Uh, The Realm of Darthon does not blow! You're probably doing it wrong. It's a role-playing game. You have to use your imagination.

Rigby: No way, dude! The game is the problem, not us!

Person in Line 1: Uh, hey, are you guys gonna be wrapping this up soon?

Clerk: Oh yeah. We're done here.

(The person goes up to the table to get TRoD checked out)

Mordecai: Hmph. Hmph. Okay, I guess you won't mind if we tell people how "cool" your game is! (to the people) Hey, everybody! Don't waste your time waiting in line for this huge piece. It's probably the worst game we've ever played.

Rigby: Yeah, and he won't even give us a refund. This guy doesn't give refunds, people! (everyone puts their copies back on the shelf)

Clerk: Let's go! (pushes M&R out the door) I want you two out of my store, now! (slams door)

Mordecai: Ugh! We can't let that guy get away with this. Dude, we spent the last of our cash on it! We have to get our money back.

Rigby: Yeah! (pause) So, how do we do that?

Mordecai: (zoom into his face) We'll just sabotage his business until he gives us our refund.

(The scene then cuts to sometime later at the store. M&R drive up in the golf cart, wearing cheaply-made costumes)

Person in Line 2: Heh, nice outfits! (chuckles) Losers. (everyone else in line laughs)

Rigby: You don't like these costumes? But they're from the "Make Your Own" section of the Darthon gamebook. (everyone in line gasps)

Mordecai: That's right. (the clerk looks on, and walks out) We followed the instructions perfectly.

Clerk: But you used toilet paper rolls, instead of paper towel rolls. The costumes look awesome when you do it right.

Rigby: Yeah? Do they look as awesome as the game pieces? (holds up an ugly-looking wizard character piece)

Person in Line 3: Ugh! (walks away)

Clerk: W-w-w-wait! There's lots of other characters if you don't like the pixie sorcerer.

Mordecai: (holds up book of characters) No there aren't. They're all just the same with different costumes. (flips pages of book to show that every character has the same ugly face and pose)

Person in Line 4: I didn't realize it was that kind of game.

Rigby: Nobody knows what kind of game it is.

Mordecai: Is it medieval? Sci-fi? Western?

Clerk: It's a role-playing game! (everyone walks away) You have to use your imagination! Ugh! (walks away)

Rigby: That's right! Go get us our refund! 

(The clerk nails a sign to the wall. It reads: "25% off The Realm of Darthon")

Passerby: No way! (everyone comes to the store because of the sign) 

Mordecai: Dude. This campaign is just getting started.

(We begin a montage of M&R discouraging the other people from buying TRoD. M&R first show two people that the stand must be set up, and that setting it up can be dangerous, making them shake their heads and walk away. The clerk gets angry and makes the game 50% off. Then, Rigby shows the people in line that the 50-sided die is only 48-sided. The people in line walk away again as the clerk watches and makes the game 75% off. Mordecai then shows the people in line how excessively long the gameboard is. The people walk away yet again, making the clerk having to sell the game for 100% off with purchase of gum. One person purchases gum and gets the game, but M&R stop the guy to show that the card deck has a joker playing card and a dry cleaning coupon. The person then throws the game against the wall and kicks it a few times before walking off. M&R high-five as the montage concludes.)

Clerk: That's it! (Comes out wearing a cape and a gold helmet, and holding a book) The Realm of Darthon does not suck!

Mordecai: Yeah, but your costume does. (M&R laugh)

(The clerk pants heavily before an aura surrounds him while he holds the book to his face, exposing his skull)

Clerk: (demonically)  No refunds! (The Clerk's face reverts back to normal, but with dilated pupils, as he laughs insanely. M&R scream before we cut to black. Torches light the scene, showing that we are now in a temple. The duo are now in authentic fantasy-like outfits)

Rigby: Dude, check out our costumes.

Mordecai: Yeah! Where are we?

(zoom out. A booming voice echoes through the temple)

Voice: Welcome, to the Realm of Darthon. (pan to the park house) Leave while you still can.

Mordecai: We're not leaving without a refund.

(The scenery around the house goes black as the doors to the way out close.)

Voice: Then come and get it!

(A gate door opens. M&R run into the temple. A noise makes sound somewhere)

Rigby: Did you hear that?

Mordecai: I think it's coming from a-- (manbats come towards M&R) ...head! (they start to swarm around them)

Rigby: Aaagh! What are these things?

Mordecai: Ignore it, dude. They're just lame enemies from the game.

Voice: Lame? What do you think of man bats' teamwork? (a big manbat sucks up some manbats in front of him and spits them at M&R, but they slice them all in half with swords)

Rigby: Next time, send enemies that don't blow. (M&R run into a foyer)

Voice: Well, if you didn't like those enemies, then how about some... (appear as said) Mutant jellyfish! Robo-bears! Angry tree people with pixie sorcerers?

(M&R start slicing the enemies, and as they die, they disappear into smoke)

Mordecai: Watch out! (throws a knife that lands into a pixie sorcerer's stomach. Although it dies, M&R are still surrounded) Dude, there are too many of them! (M&R look at each other)

Voice: Come on! Everyone knows technomancers can summon allies.

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: (pushes buttons on keyboard) Summon allies! (three orbs are unleashed into the air. The orbs summon Skips, a warrior, Pops, a cyborg cowboy, and Benson, an elf) 

Benson: What the-- (in the BG, M&R are fighting the bad guys) I told you guys I didn't want to play this game.

Mordecai: We need your help!

Rigby: We need the refund from the game master!

Benson: What? (a robo-bear roars, and starts charging towards them. Skips goes over and kills the robo-bear with one swipe of the blade. A bird flies onto his shoulder) When this is over, you two are dead!

(Benson fires an arrow. M&R fend off some formally-dressed jack o'lanterns. Pops pushes buttons on a keyboard, firing a laser at an angry tree person, killing it)

Pops: Oooh! (Laughs while firing lasers at mutant jellyfish. There's still a lot of enemies around them all. Skips kills a jack o'lantern, and Benson fires an arrow at a mutant jellyfish. Pops is still trigger crazy.)

Mordecai: Haha, yeah!

Voice: I changed my mind. Necromancers can't summon allies. (Benson, Pops and Skips disappear)

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: He's just cheating so he can win!

Rigby: Quit chea-- (a pixie sorcerer shoves him in the stomach, pinning him to the ground, and punches Rigby. A mutant jellyfish is stuck to Mordecai)

Voice: I'm not cheating. I'm using my imagination! (Mordecai slices the jellyfish, splitting it into two) That's what makes this game fun!

Mordecai: That's what makes this game blow!

Voice: Enough! (enemies disappear. A light shines) I won't allow you to insult my realm any longer.

(the silhouette of a knight appears into the light, and reveals itself on top of the steps)

Darthon: I am Darthon! (the mace levitates into the air, and its spikes morph into screaming faces that turn into a ghost skeleton) Still think this game blows?

(The ghost flies towards M&R as they scream. Rigby unleashes a lightning bolt from his finger)

Darthon: Lightning bolts have no effect on giant monsters. (the lightning bolt bounces off the ghost. Mordecai throws a bomb) Projectile weapons deal damage to the user! (the bomb morphs into a boomerang and explodes over M&R's heads) Oh no, You stepped in a permafrost puddle! (the ground freezes under M&R's feet, causing them to slip) Players are frozen in place! (ice freezes up to M&R's necks. The ghost is coming towards them)

Rigby: Stay back! (the ghost stops) Self-destruct? (the ghost explodes. M&R look at each other, now realizing the only way to defeat Darthon is to beat him at his own role-playing game - fight magical fire with magical fire, in other words.)

Mordecai: We are not frozen. (the ice around them breaks) Looks like it's our turn.

(The duo start running)

Darthon: Your party is washed away by a flood! (summons a tidal wave)

Mordecai: Our +3 awesomeness repels water. (the wave fails to attack M&R. Darthon screams in anger and summons a fireball)

Rigby: Fireballs are made of kittens! (fireball becomes kittens)

Darthon: Kittens are man-eating tigers! (kittens become tigers)

Mordecai: Man-eating tigers turn into stuffed animals! (tigers become stuffed animals. The stuffed animals run into the duo as they run up the steps)

Darthon: Players lose their weapons when running! (Mordecai's sword and Rigby's staff fly off)

Mordecai: Warriors carry the Immunity Sword, which is immune to all rule changes! (pulls out sword)

Darthon: W-what?! No! That's not--

(Mordecai stabs Darthon with the Immunity Sword in the chest, beating the Dungeon Master in his own game. Darthon screams in agonized pain)

Mordecai: Now give us our refund.

(Darthon kneels to the ground as we fade to the real world. It turns out Darthon was the clerk)

Mordecai and Rigby: Haha! Yeah, we did it! (the clerk groans. It turns out the immunity sword was a ruler)

Mordecai: Dude, are you okay?

Clerk: Yeah. I'm fine. Here's your refund. (pulls out the money)

Mordecai: No, it's cool. You should keep it.

Clerk: No, no. You beat me fair and square. (hands Rigby the money)

Rigby: Are you sure you're alright?

Mordecai: Yeah. We can take you to the hospital.

Clerk: No. No. I'm fine. (gets in car) I just need an icepack. (struggles to get seatbelt in) I... just... gotta... I gotta go up and lay down for a bit. (drives off. Benson, Pops and Skips walk up)

Pops: Mordecai! Rigby!

Mordecai: Pops! Where have you guys been?

Benson: We were hiding in the armor closet, then suddenly, we were in the stock room at Shoe Farm.

Rigby: (pulls out money) Good thing it was worth it! (shakes money) Seven bones, baby!

Benson: Seven dollars?! We almost died for seven dollars?!

Rigby: The numbers aren't important.

Mordecai: It was the principle.

Rigby: Yeah. If we're gonna spend that kind of money, it's gotta be on a cool game.

Mordecai: Yeah. Something like Trail of Elderich or The Lair of Anthalon.

Rigby: Dude, Is that out?

Mordecai: Yeah. It came out last week.

(M&R run into the store)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeayuh!

(End of But I Have a Receipt)

(Epiaode begins at Pops' house. Mordecai, Eileen, Benson, Pops, Muscle Man and Skips are throwing a party in honor of Rigby.)

All except Rigby: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!

(Episode begins at The Coffee Shop with the T.V. set to the weather channel.)

Mordecai: Big trouble in the Western Hemisphere. These teeth are gonna bite down on this snowstorm.

Rigby: Then this cloud is gonna punch some dude in the face.

Mordecai: More at eleven.

(They both laugh)

Margaret: Hey guys, do you need anymore-

Rigby: SSHHHHHHHH!!! This is it! (increases the TV volume)

Weather Girl: Your Weekend Weather Forecast. Hope you have your sunglasses ready. Because it'll be two days of clear skies and sunshine.

Mordecai: Sunshine!

Rigby: Sunshine!

Eileen: Oh, you guys talking about the weather? I love the weather.

Margaret: Why are you guys so interested in the weather?

Mordecai: We're going on a camping trip.

Eileen: Wow, really? I love camping. Camping is so cool. (to Margaret) Right, Margaret?

Margaret: (unsure) Oh, uh...sure. I've never been camping before.

Mordecai: You never been camping?

Rigby: What's wrong with you?

(Mordecai punches Rigby)

Margaret: No, it's alright. It's just never been appealed to me, I guess.

Rigby: Yeah, you probably would like it.

Margaret: Well...

Mordecai: Don't listen to him, Margaret. Camping can be really cool. There's hiking in the mountain, and looking at the stars at night, we even got a secret camping spot.

Eileen: That's so awesome. I wish we could go with you guys.

Mordecai: Why don't you?

Rigby: What?

Margaret: What?

Eileen: Really?

Mordecai: Why not? The more, the merrier, right?

Margaret: I don't know...

Eileen: C'mon, Margaret. It'll be fun.

Margaret: Okay, I guess it could be cool.

Eileen: (hugs Margaret) Yay!

Rigby: You probably shouldn't go, Margaret. I bet your boyfriend won't like you going out on a camping trip with two dudes.

Margaret: Ugh, what boyfriend? Not seeing anyone right now. Guys are jerks.

Mordecai: Gah, I know, right? Guys are the worst! (pulls a face expression at Rigby) So it's settled we're all going camping.

Margaret: (laughs) How can I argue with enthusiasm like that?

(The scenes shows Margaret's car going out from The Park. Everyone seems to enjoy the trip, except for Rigby. The scenes shows the car going to the National Forest) 

Park Ranger: Morning.

Margaret: Hi! (the park ranger is pointing to the radio) Oh, uh... sorry. (turns off the radio)

Park Ranger: Where y'all heading today?

Margaret: Oh, um... (to Mordecai) Hey, where's this secret-

Mordecai: We're just heading up to the camp grounds.

Park Ranger: Oh, Vine Rich or Valley Fields?

Mordecai: Yeah, mm-hmm. (shakes his head)

Park Ranger: (confused) Alright. Well, here's the map. (gives a map) Stick to the road and trails.

Margaret: Great.

Margaret and Eileen: Thank you.

Eileen: Alright. So, which way are we heading?

Mordecai: No, we don't need that. (takes the map from Eileen) Just stop up right here.

Margaret: What? Right here?

(The car stops and the sign says 'Restricted No Public Access')

Mordecai: (to Rigby) Ok, go, dude.

Rigby: Excuse me, gettin' out. (opens the gate)

Eileen: Wait. What are you guys doing?

Mordecai: We told you. Secret Spot!

Margaret: But it says "Restricted". I don't think we're supposed to be-

Mordecai: No, it's fine. We always do this. Just trust me.

(Margaret drives inside. Inside, they get out of the car and see a camping spot.)

Margaret: So, this is your secret camping spot?

Mordecai: Yeah, we always come here. It's really far from the other campsites, so no one bothers us.

Eileen: Are you sure we won't get in trouble?

Mordecai: It's fine, it's fine. You guys ready for the best part? (walks off) Check this out.

(Margaret and Eileen opens up two trees to show two waterfalls and a river, both wows at the beautiful view)

Mordecai: (stares at Margaret) Not bad, right? 

Margaret: (stares at Mordecai) Mordecai, it's beautiful. 

Rigby: (offscreen) Hey, Mordecai, where are the matches?

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: (offscreen) The matches! I wanna cook some hot dogs.

Mordecai: Uhhhh, they should be in that pack, dude.

Rigby: (offscreen) I can't find 'em.

Mordecai: Awwwwwwwwwwwww! Give me that. (takes the pack and looks in it) They're not in here.

Rigby: You forgot them?

Mordecai: What do you mean I forgot them?

Margaret: (runs up to Mordecai and Rigby) Don't fight! They probably just fell out of the bag or something.

Eileen: It's cool, guys. I got it. (by rubbing two sticks together she made a fire and blew it to make it bigger)

Mordecai: Did you find the matches?

Eileen: No, I just did it the old-fashioned way.

Margaret: Wow, Eileen. I didn't know you were so handy.

Eileen: Yeah, I used to get lost in the woods a lot.

Margaret: When you were a kid?

Eileen: Last year. It was kind of a phase I was going through.

Margaret: Oh, well. Good job, Eileen.

Rigby: Yeah, that was kinda cool.

Eileen: (blushes from what Rigby said)

Rigby: Uh... (picked up hot dogs) Catch! (threw hot dogs to eileen right in her face. The hot dogs fell in her hands and her face was red)

Eileen: (looks down at the hot dogs) Oh, nice! These are really good hot dogs. (which the hot dogs said were "super extra premium hot dogs real ingredients")

(Then we go to a montage when first they eat some hot dogs from the fire, then go hiking to a water fall, then go swimming, then when walking they see a deer that Margaret tries to take a picture of, and when she was about to pick up a frog. She saw Eileen with four snakes and Rigby showed a bite which grossed Margaret and Eileen out and saw the deer again for a second when Mordecai walked up)

(It was night and Rigby and Eileen were playing video games and Mordecai was with Margret laying on her car)

Margaret: Ahh. This is beautiful. The sky is so clear out here. (looking at a constellation) Do you know any of the, um... The, uh... (puts her hand on her head) The thingies?

Mordecai: Thingies?

Margaret: Yeah, the, uh...

Mordecai: Constellations?

Margaret: Yeah, yeah, constellations.

Mordecai: Oh, those thingies.

Margaret: (elbows Mordecai) Be quiet.

Mordecai: Yeah, I think that's a "Ursala Merger" right there. (pointing at a constellation) See like the handle and the ladle?

Eileen: It's called Ursa Major, not "Ursala Merger", and that's not even it, that's Orion. (not looking up from her video game)

Rigby: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! And she didn't even have to look up!

Rigby, Margaret and Eileen: (laughs)

Mordecai: Okay, okay, so I don't know those thingies. Okay, wait. I can show you something cool. Give me your keys. (gives keys to Mordecai. He opens a car door and sticks the key onto the switch that turned the ignition, turns on the audio system to some romantic music, closes the door and gets back on the car)

Margaret: Ah, nice save. (Margaret lays down and there hand go close to each other)

Mordecai: So...you, uh... you still taking those classes?

Margaret: Yeah, yeah. This semester's been crazy, just been working all, and these extra projects... Well, you know.

Mordecai: Yeah, but that was art school. It's different.

Margaret: Ah, I just can't wait until I can finally quit my dumb job.

Mordecai: Ah, what? Then where will I get my coffee from?

Margaret: The coffee will still be there

Mordecai: Yeah, it...just...wouldn't be the same. So, you don't think all guys are jerks, right?

Margaret: Wait. Did you hear that?

Mordecai: What?

Margaret: (listens and hears nothing) I dunno.

Mordecai: It's just the sound of the wilderness. Probably just that deer we saw earlier.

Margaret: Hmm... (rolls back over to Mordecai) So what were you saying? (hear thunder and it starts raining)

Mordecai: I guess we should set up the tent. (looks in the pack for the tents) Rigby, where'd you put the tent?

Rigby: Uh...

Mordecai: Is it in the other bag?

Rigby: I didn't bring it.

Mordecai: Dude! I told you to pack it!

Rigby: Yeah, but I wanted to use the tarps like we always do.

Mordecai: Then where are the tarps?

Rigby: I forgot them.

Mordecai: What?! (the fire burned out) 

Margaret: (running over) What's going on?

Mordecai: We don't have a tent.

Eileen: It's okay, I brought mine. It's in the car.

Margaret: I'll get it. (attempting to open a door and seeing the keys are on the switch to the ignition) Dude! You locked the keys in the car!

Rigby: Smooth move. (Mordecai put his hand on his forehead.) you had to turn on the radio.

Mordecai: (a car shows up and beeps) Oh, great. Now the ranger's here.

Park Ranger: What are you folks doing out here? This area's restricted.

Eileen: I know, we're sorry.

Margaret: We locked our keys in the car.

Park Ranger: All right, I got some tools back at the station. But as soon as I get that door open, I want you outta here.

Margaret and Eileen: Okay, thank you. (he leaves)

Rigby: Oh, great! Now we gotta wait in the rain for that guy to come back. 

Eileen: Hey! (with a stick tent that got started) Let's build a shelter! (they help Eileen put it together) Go grab some more dead branches. (Margaret does and picks one pulls it off a tree and goes by some bushes when the deer pops out. She screams, then chuckles nervously.)

Deer: Take filthy hands off branches!

Margaret: What?!                                      

(The deer comes out of bushes, revealing he is half human)

Margaret: Mordecai!!!!! (drops sticks and runs to Mordecai)

Mordecai: What? What is it? (the deer comes walking toward them) Ahh! Whoa, hey. What's up, man?

Stag-Man: I have been watching for years now. Bringing your filthy machines into my forest, setting her a blaze, drowning out her natural voice with your terrible music. And I've had enough!

Mordecai: Look, we're sorry, dude. We're not trying to ruin your home. We love the forest. Right, guys? (everyone says an answer)

Stag-Man: Just like mother said she loved me and not to follow her back to the city?

Mordecai: Wait, what? 

Stag-Man: You disgust me. My forest is ruined! And now I will count to ten and hunt you for food.

Everyone: What?!

Stag-Man: Do not fear. I will use all your parts. Nothing wasted. One...

Mordecai: Oh, dude!

Stag-Man: Two... (they all ran and Eileen picks up a rock) Three... (Eileen busts a window on the car and goes in to hit the horn.)

Eileen: Come on, come on!

Stag-Man: Four... (tries to take out bow and arrow from the top but his antlers are too long and they all get in the car except the Stag-Man. Margaret flips the key on the switch but the engine fails to start.)

Margaret: The radio drained the battery! (Rigby frowns at Mordecai)

Stag-Man: Five, six...(takes the bow and arrow out from under his feet)

Everyone: Come on, come on, come on, come on! (the engine fires and starts.)

Stag-Man: Seven, eight, nine, ten! (started chasing after them)

Margaret: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

Mordecai: We're gonna need to go faster! (the Stag-man was catching up to the car then Mordecai and Rigby opened the trunk and threw sodas at him which made him more mad)

Mordecai: Ahhhh!! Dude, get me something else to thow at him! (Mordecai slamed a lantern in his face which held him back)

Rigby: In your face!

Mordecai: I think we lost him. (just then he jumped on the top of the car)

(Everyone screams. He cut a knife throw the top, which made Margaret's swerve out of control down a hill and the deer fell off he shot a bow and arrow at the tire and they stopped by hitting a tree they got out of the car and ran the deer jumped on the front of the car and jumed off mordecai saw another road)

Mordecai: There's the highway! Come on! 

(The Stag-Man shot three arrows beside them and one under them. They got to the high way where the park ranger was coming)

Rigby: Over there! Look! Someone's coming!

(all called for help when the Stag-Man was about to shoot them with arrows the park ranger swerved around them)

Park Ranger: Ahhhh! (he went around them and hit the Stag-Man)

(the next morning)

Park Ranger: All right, you folks better move it along. now Nothing more to see here.

Margaret: What's gonna happen to him? (seeing a gut throw the deer in park ranger's truck)

Park Ranger: We've got special proto call for situation's like that. You all drive safe, now you hear? (they drive away and park ranger goes to the back of his truck where the National Forest Employee is) Did you get the boys to call up the taxidurbist?

National Forest Employee: Isn't this kinda strange? (looking down at the deer)

Park Ranger: No, we'll just...tsk, tsk...put some clothes on the human-y parts 

(back in the car)

Mordecai: Sorry about this, Margaret.

Margaret: I don't know; it wasn't all bad. I liked your secret camping spot.

Eileen: I ate seven hot dogs.

Rigby: And you totally busted Margaret's window open with a rock!

Eileen: Oh, yeah. Sorry about that, Margaret.

Margaret: It's okay. I'm just stoked I survived my first camping trip. (looks to Mordecai on the rear mirror) Thanks, Mordecai.

Mordecai: (chuckles) No problem. See, I told you camping was cool.

Everyone: (laughs and episode ends)


(Episode begins with the dome-sealed Park going through space.)

Mordecai: What an awesome trip to the Summertime Planet.

Rigby: Yeah, I've been dying to get one of these Uber soakers. (The duo squirt each other with the Uber Soakers) What's next?

Recap Robot: We're going to run some errands.

M and R: Errands!

(The spaceship lands on a dome platform. The scene cuts to Mordecai, Rigby, Chance Shureshot, Toothpick Sally and Recap Robot walking in the dome on a path)

Recap Robot: Welcome to Planet Lobius everyone.

Toothpick Sally: What are we here for exactly?

Recap Robot: I need to pick up a roll on film that I had developed.

Chance Sureshot: Why did you come here to get it developed?

Recap Robot: There the only planet that still does it.

(Sally, Sureshot and Recap turn their heads around to see Mordecai and Rigby playing with their Uber Soakers next to a tree. Rigby squirts first with Mordecai dodging the water. Rigby hides behind a tree and when he turns around he is squirted by Mordecai and says OOOOOHHH!!! in celebration)

Recap Robot: Hey, you know how you just said OOOOOHHH!!! really loud.

Rigby: Yeah?

Recap Robot: Well, never say that on this Planet. These people are very sensitive to sound. So be respectful and please keep it down.

Mordecai: No problem.

Rigby: Easy enough.

(The five walk out of the dome. During that time M and R look up by saying Woah. They see a group of ears (a couple holding hands and walking, another wearing a hat and reading the newspaper along with another person standing next to a building wearing a dress) much to the duo's astonishment. The gang keep walking and see a man at his house looking at his chimes.)

Ear 1: I can't stand these chimes. (removes the chimes off the top of his house and walks away)

(The duo notice an ear opening a bag of chips sitting on a bench next to another person on his phone. The ear opens the bag of chips and before he eats him, the lady interrupts him)

Ear 2: Do you mind?

Ear 3: Oh, sorry mam.

(An ear is walking a dog shaped like an ear. When a bird chirps and flies by, the ear dog reacts by barking.)

Ear 4: No, Rufus, that is too much!

(The ear places a chew toy in Rufus's mouth before he whimpers. The scene cuts to a mall called RX. We transition to Shuteshot, M and R and Recap Robot entering the mall via an automatic screen door)

Recap Robot: I'll be done in a jiffy. (moves away)

Chance Sureshot: I'm gonna see what they've got for hair gel.

Toothpick Sally: I wonder if they've got cinnamon toothpicks.

(Both Sureshot and Sally walk away together to find what they need. Meanwhile, Mordecai and Rigby look at each other and continue squirting their Uber Soakers. After Mordecai squirts his in Rigby's face, Rigby gets aggressive and fires back at him but unintentionally squirts a large cotton bud next to a sign saying Sale 50% off. The cotton on the bud absorbs the water, knocks down a large light, much to the horror of the Ears at the mall. The light knocks down a shelf of cell phones, causing them to vibrate and get electrocuted by the fallen and wet cotton bud in the process. Smoke is later absorbed into the fire alarm and starts blaring. Whilst the ears react in agony, the glass protecting the inside of the mall cracks and shatters. Recap Robot returns with Sally and Sureshot.)

Recap Robot: What's going on?

Mordecai: Uh... we should probably leave.

(Before M and R leave the premises, two ear guards arrest the duo.)

Ear Cop 1: You're under arrest.

Rigby: On what charge?

Ear Cop 2: For making a ruckus.

(The scene cuts to Lobius Courthouse)

Benson: Typical. They would do something like this.

Skips: Hey, innocent until proven guilty?

Benson: No they didn't.

Skips: Oh yeah.

Muscle Man: (Looks at an image of an ear with the words The Auricle engraved on the frame of the picture.) Who's the old lobe?

Recap Robot: That's The Auricle. The oldest most respected ear on Lobius.

Eileen: Shouldn't they call him the Earicle? It really seems like a missed opportunity.

Judge: Order, order in the court. Prosecution will now give its opening remarks.

Prosecute Ear: Thank you, your honor. Ladies and Gentle ears of the jury. We are here to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mordecai and Rigby intentionally caused a ruckus and should be punished seve-ear-ly. Ears chucke in the distance.

Judge: Public defendear, how do you plead?

Defendant Ear: Uh... Not guilty.

Judge: Alright. Prosecute ear, call your first witness.

Prosecute Ear: Gladly, your honor. I call Mordecai to the stand.

Police Ear: Place your hand on the Auricle if you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Mordecai: (places hand on the Auricle Stand) I swear.

Prosecute Ear: (walks to the stand) Mordecai, would you be so kind as to tell these folks what transpired earlier today? You know, when you and your friend made that horrible noise downtown?

Mordecai: We can explain.

Prosecute Ear: I'm 100% ready to listen.

Eileen: He really should have said "I'm all ears!" It's right there!

Mordecai: So, Rigby and I just got these cool new Uber Soakers. Rigby tried to squirt me but he missed and it was all just a big accident! Okay?!

Prosecute Ear: Oh! An "accident?" Why don't you tell that to poor little Jesse down in the ICU! (pulls picture of Jessie wrapped in bandages on a bed. All the ears gasp in shock after seeing the image.) Jesse has already been hit by a car but that loud noise interrupted his favorite show. Very tragic. No more questions.

Rigby:  (looking at the Defendant Ear) You gotta help us man! We're dying out there!

Defendant Ear: Don't worry. All I gotta do is present these records that prove that you were nowhere near that phonebook.

Rigby: Our case doesn't have anything to do with a phone booth!

Defendant Ear: Wait, is this Room 17?

Rigby: NO, IT'S NOT!

Prosecute Ear: I now call Rigby to the stand. (scene cuts to Rigby at the stand) So, what would you say happened, Mr. Rigby?

Rigby: Like Mordecai said: Uber Soaker, accident, loud noise, boom!

(Ears gasp)

Judge: Watch your point, or I'll hold you in contempt.

Mordecai: Oh, geez. Come on, can't you do something.

Defendant Ear: Uh, uh, I'd like to call for a recess, your Honor!

Judge: Make it quick.

(The scene cuts to a room with a bookshelf and ear paintings. The Defendant is in the room alongside Mordecai and Rigby, walking around and feeling nervous.)

Defendant Ear: What we need is uh... OH! Character witnesses! You know, people who would testify that you would never make a loud noise on purpose. Say that you would not troublemakers or something.

Mordecai: I think our friends can do that.

Rigby: Yeah. If there's anyone we can count on, it's their friends.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Cheering to the T.V.) Car-ter! Bri-iggs! Car-ter! Bri-iggs! Car-ter! Bri-iggs!

(Goes to "Carter and Briggs". Briggs throws the suspect (Named Sammy Krendelman) over the hood of the car.)

Sammy: Hey!

(Briggs takes his wallet)

Briggs: Looky what we got here, Carter.

(Briggs tosses the wallet to Carter.)

Sammy: (Angered) Why am I being arrested?!

Briggs: Attempted hit and run.

Carter: (Sly) Ah, Slammy Fenderbend.

Sammy: (Defensive) That's not my name!

(Carter and Briggs get in the vehicle with Sammy in the back.)

Carter: We know you work for Escobito, Sammy.

(Static is heard and Commissioner Davis comes through the intercom.)

Davis: Carter and Briggs! This is Commissioner Davis. You two are loose canons!

Briggs: (Sarcastic) Whatever, Commissioner La-mis.

(Carter and Briggs's theme music plays)

Davis: (Angered) Carter! Briggs!!

Carter and Briggs: Awww, ye-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ah!!

(Briggs hits the gas and does a donut. The screen freeze-frames as credits appear for the executive producer (T. M. Blunderbuss))

Narrator: Next week on "Carter and Briggs".

(Carter and Briggs are doing donuts while shooting guns in a warehouse with four masked men, one of which falls from an upper-level.)

Carter and Briggs: Ye-e-e-e-e-e-AH!!

Carter: Escobitoooooooo!

(Briggs shoots a missile)

(The scene turns back to the living room)

Rigby: (To Mordecai) You know what I like about this show? (Crosses arms) The realism.

Mordecai: And their custom 1985 police cruiser, engineered for doing donuts. 

(Mordecai imitates a car screeching while pretending to turn a driving wheel.)

Rigby: (High-pitched) Donuts for Show-Nuts!

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh)

Rigby: (With his fist in the air) Best cop show ever!

Announcer on the TV: Would you like to meet Carter and Briggs?

Rigby: (To the T.V.) Yes!

Announcer: They'll be at Horton Motor Arena this weekend, judging the 8th Annual Donut Spin-a-thon! (Deeper voice) Spin-a-thon!

Rigby: Donuts!

Mordecai: We do donuts all the time.

Rigby: (High-pitched) For Show-nuts!

Announcer: Whoever holds the longest spin will win! (Deeper voice) WIN! 

Rigby: (Anxious) Win what? Win whaaat?

Announcer: You and a friend could win... a guest starring role on "Carter and Briggs"!

(Mordecai and Rigby anxiously gasp.)

Rigby: Ah! Awesome!

Mordecai and Rigby: (At the same time respectively) We should-! We really should-!

Rigby: (Pointing at Mordecai) You go first.

Mordecai: Dude... Dude... Duuude. We gotta enter that contest.

Rigby: That's exactly what I was gonna say! Are we on the same level or what?

Mordecai and Rigby: (They raise their arms) Who-OOOOOOOOAH!!

(Mordecai and Rigby run out of the house.)

(Pops enters the living room and looks at the television.)

Narrator: And now it's time for "Crime She Typed".

Pops: (Excited) Oooh! What's she going to type this time?

(Transitions clockwise into next scene. Mordecai and Rigby are in the cart, in front of the house, doing donuts.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ooooooooooh! (They slide off to the side) Awwww...

(They reattempt the donut)

Mordecai and Rigby: Oooooooh! (They slide off again)

Rigby: Aww...

Mordecai: Aw, man...

Rigby: Dude...Maybe we're not as good at this as we thought...

Mordecai: Yeah...Who do we know that's really good at spinning donuts?

(Scene goes to outside Muscle Man and HFG's trailer. Muscle Man is working with some tools.)

Mordecai: Muscle Man. We need your help.

Muscle Man: Can't you toolboxes say that I'm busy organizing my toolboxes?

Rigby: There's a donut-spinning contest, and we need to win!

Muscle Man: (Confused) But donut sports are off-season.

Mordecai: But Carter and Briggs are holding it!

Muscle Man: What? That show's for babies, bro.

Mordecai and Rigby: Come on! Without your help we ca--

Muscle Man: (Interrupting) But.....I do love spinning donuts. (Crosses arms) Your first lesson is tomorrow at dawn.

(Transitions clockwise to Mordecai and Rigby in front of the house meeting with Muscle Man.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Gives an aggravated sigh)

Rigby: (Whining) Why do we have to get up so early...?

Mordecai: (Exhausted) I'm gonna need more coffee...

(Muscle Man knocks Mordecai's cup of coffee out of his hand.)

Muscle Man: Coffee is for people who don't have adrenaline!

Rigby: (Teasing Mordecai) Yeah! Get some adrena-

(Muscle Man knocks the cup out of Rigby's hand.)

Rigby: (Whining) My coffee...

Muscle Man: (Taking charge) Now listen up! (Climbs on top of the cart, making souns of struggling) Donuts are an ancient practice that probably started in some foreign country, by old wizards, or something. The number one rule is to keep your turn radius small. 

Rigby: Turn radius?

Muscle Man: (Jumps off the cart, pulls out a rod, and draws a 10' diameter circle in the dirt.) Keep your front wheel in this circle. (Points at the circle with finger.) The smaller the radius, the longer you can hold the spin. So let's get to work on your radius.

(Scene goes to Mordecai and Rigby practicing their donuts' radius, but they fall out of line with the circle)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aww...

Muscle Man: Augh! I told you! Hold the turn radius! Now do it again! (Blows his whistle)

(Mordecai and Rigby attempt the donut again.)

Muscle Man: Hold it! Hold it!

(Mordecai and Rigby continue the donut)

(The scene goes to Muscle Man drawing an 8' diameter circle within the previous circle. Mordecai and Rigby are displeased but carry on their training)

(The shot is focused on their donuts while Muscle Man's head pans through the shot)

Muscle Man: Master the radius.

(The circle turns into the sun and then the moon as Mordecai and Rigby continue their donuts around it)

Muscle Man: The smaller the radius, the longer you hold.

(Mordecai and Rigby keep doing smaller and smaller radiuses)

Muscle Man: Woooooooo! (Dusts flies towards him, making him cough. He then walks to Mordecai and Rigby.) Good form, nice circle work, and you cut your turn radius in half.

Rigby: Alright, let's get it down to zero!

Muscle Man: Whoa. You wanna drive in a vortex, bro?

Rigby: Huh?

Muscle Man: Zero turning radius is only theoretical. When you find that sweet spot, Infinite donuts.

(Mordecai and Rigby gawk at Muscle Man.)

Muscle Man: But you've gotta spin in a vortex. (Twirls finger around.) It's too dangerous to attempt. (Becomes reassuring) I think you guys are ready now. Congratulations, losers.

(Muscle Man walks away as Mordecai and Rigby shake hands and walk away just to turn back and give each other a high five. (Freeze frame on the high five))

(Transitions to Skip's garage.)

Skips: Alright, fellas. The cart is ready to go. Got it all tuned up. Refreshed the fluids, filled her with special high octane fuel, and installed extra bald, no friction tires. With these babies, you'll be spinning donuts for days. (Nods)

Mordecai and Rigby: Thanks, Skips.

Skips: Don't mention it. Good luck out there.

(Skips tosses them the cart keys, but is intercepted by Benson.)

Benson: Not so fast. I heard all about your little contest. There's no way I'll let you guys do it. (Points at Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Rigby: Why not?

Benson: Unless you wear these on T.V. if you win. (Holds up a shirt)

Mordecai: Oh. Let me see. (Mordecai is handed the shirt and holds it up)

(The shirt has red seams on the sleeves and neck, and plain text that says "The Park")

Mordecai: (Trying to sound sort of convincing) Wow...Great design...(Nervously laughs)

(The scene goes to the 8th Annual Donut Spin-a-thon where some of the competition are getting ready.)

Mordecai: Oh, man...These guys are pretty serious.

(The shot overlooks the competitions' vehicles.)

Muscle Man: Don't get psyched out, bros. It's not about the equipment. It's about heart...Wait...That doesn't sound right...It's about turn radius. And you two got that down.

Mordecai: Thanks, Muscle Man.

Rigby: Dude, look! (Points upward) It's Carter and Briggs!  

(Carter and Briggs are waving to the audience)

Briggs: (Into a microphone) Alright. You guys ready for some donuts?

(The crowd cheers)

Briggs: I can't hear you! I said, "Are you ready?!"

(Crowd cheers louder)

Briggs: Thank you! My hearing's not so good! (Raises arm) And now, whoever holds the longest spin, will win!

(The Spin-a-thon starts as a montage begins. Mordecai and Rigby face their first opponents, who quickly lost their spin, making Mordecai and Rigby continue on. Mordecai and Rigby face their second opponents, whose bus tire breaks and their bus flips to an edge of the stadium, killing them, making Mordecai and Rigby continue on. Benson, Hi Five Ghost and Pops hold up three signs that says "Mordo & Rigs" which they flip over and says "Kick Their Butts". Mordecai and Rigby face their third opponents, who felt sick and had to stop to vomit. Mordecai and Rigby continue on as the crowd cheer on them. Mordecai drinks a bottle of water, then passes it to Rigby who squirts the bottle on his head. Skips repairs the wheel while Muscle Man give Mordecai and Rigby some more advice to about keeping their turn radius small. Mordecai and Rigby face their next opponents, whose engine burst into flames and the opponents caught on fire, making Mordecai and Rigby won as the crowd cheers and the montage ends.)

Briggs: Welcome to the final round!

Rigby: It's really you guys!

Briggs: What are your names, contestants?

Mordecai: Mordecai and Rigby, sir.

Briggs: Yeah, yeah, that's great. Anyway...

Carter: Let's see who you'll be up against.

(Mordecai and Rigby gasp)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro!

(A police cruiser is revealed with two posers dressed as Carter and Briggs in it)

Muscle Man: (continued) A mint-condition 1985 police cruiser? 300 horsepower V8, extra bald tire streaks, aerodynamic chassis?

(The Briggs poser drives as Mordecai and Rigby scream, then they do donuts until they stop. They come out as the crowd cheers)

Carter: Hey, Briggs! Those guys look like us!

Briggs Poser: (as he and the Carter poser bow to the real Carter and Briggs) It is an honor, Carter and Briggs. And as for you two posers, you are going down.

Mordecai: Posers? We don't need Halloween costumes to be fans.

Briggs Poser: As Escobito said in the TV movie "Carter and Briggs Bust Russia": We will destroy them your holiness.

Mordecai: Well, as Briggs said in episode 238: Shut your crime hole.

Carter Poser: Episode 129: Eat Taser! (takes out a Taser)

(Carter and Briggs laugh nervously)

Briggs: Alright.

Carter: Which team will win the chance to be on Carter and Briggs?

Briggs: Probably the one that's exact replica of police cruiser, am I right?

Carter and Briggs: Awww, ye-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ah!!

Carter: Teams, to your vehicles!

(The two teams go to their vehicles. Muscle Man goes to Mordecai and Rigby)

Muscle Man: Bros! Bros! Don't listen to them. Focus. They have a 1985 police cruiser replica, which is pretty much the perfect donut spinning winning machine. But I don't train losers to lose, I train winners to win. Now go win this Donut Spin-a-thon, losers! (He walks away)

Mordecai: Thanks, I guess.

(The final round of the Spin-a-thon starts as the two teams do donuts)

Muscle Man: Up the ante, bros!

(Mordecai shifts the stick gear, which makes their cart spin faster, then the Briggs poser shifts the stick gear, which makes their police cruiser spin faster)

Briggs Poser: Hit the grease!

(He pushes a button, which releases grease on the ground and they spin on it)

Benson: Come on!

Carter: Whoa! That street-legal, Brad?

Briggs: Does it matter?

(They kept spinning on the grease until they get closer to the cart as Mordecai and Rigby scream, then they bump the cart, making both of the teams' vehicles bump into the walls of the stadium until they continue to spin)

Mordecai: You'll never break our spin!

Rigby: We got mad skills!

Briggs Poser: Who need skills?

(He pulls a lever, which lets out an engine and a speed booster as Mordecai and Rigby scream, then the cruiser spins and hit Mordecai and Rigby's cart, making the vehicles spin at zero turning radius and create a vortex, which the crowd, except Muscle Man and Skips, who are holding an edge of the stadium, run away. They spin in the vortex as Mordecai and Rigby scream and the the Crater and Briggs poser laugh maniacally)

Carter Poser: Resisting defeat, we have ways of dealing with you!

(He grabs a baton and hits Mordecai and Rigby, but Rigby grabs the Carter poser's arm.)

Carter Poser: The sooner you die, the sooner we'll be on "Carter and Briggs."

Mordecai: You guys are psycho!

(They see a piece of the ground above the vortex, then Rigby bites the Carter poser's arm, making him drop the baton and land in Rigby's hands. Rigby throws the baton at the piece of the ground, making it fall, then Mordecai spins the cart away from the police cruiser)

Carter Poser: That hurt!

(The piece of the ground crashes on the police cruiser, causing it to drive at the bottom of the vortex and it explodes, killing the two posers)

Rigby: We're gonna win!

(A skull monster with tentacles rises up)

Rigby: We're gonna die!

Mordecai: What do we do?!

(Rigby gasps)

Muscle Man: (voice-over) You gonna drive in a vortex, bro?

Rigby: Dude! We gonna do zero turning radius! Spin in a vortex!

Mordecai: But that's crazy!

Rigby: Have any better ideas?

(Mordecai pumps the gas pump and turns the wheel to spin with the vortex)

Mordecai: Hold it!

(The cart starts spinning with the vortex as the two are vibrating)

Mordecai: It's workinnnnnnng!

Rigby: Zeeeero turrrrning radiuuuus!

(The cart continues to spin with the vortex until it rises out of the vortex as the crowd watches. Muscle Man smiles. Carter and Briggs get up)

Briggs: We have a winner!

(The cart comes down and stops spinning as Mordecai, Rigby and the cart are vibrating. Carter and Briggs give Mordecai and Rigby medals, which they magnetically land on their chests.)

Carter: Congrats, Motor-cai and Spins-by.

Briggs: See you two on set.

(Mordecai and Rigby gasp excitedly. Scene circle-wipes to the house where the guys, including Margaret, Eileen and Thomas, are in the living room watching Mordecai and Rigby's guest starring roles on Carter and Briggs.)

Benson: This free publicity will be so good for the park.

Mordecai: Shh! Be quiet. Our scene is next.

(They watch the scene where Mordecai and Rigby, who are wearing the shirts Benson gave them, are in an area in town with Carter and Briggs where the scene is made)

Rigby: Pu-pulling us of the street won't do-do a thing, Carter and Briggs.

(Carter and Briggs look disappointed)

Mordecai: Yeah. Crime is like a lizard's tail It always... (cough) It always grows back?

Briggs: Take your last breath of fresh air, punks. 'Cause you won't be breathing them for a long time.

(Carter is proceeding to arrest Rigby)

Rigby: Hey! That actually hurt!

(The screen freeze-frames as credits appear for the executive producer (T. M. Blunderbuss))

Mordecai: So, what do everybody think?

(Everyone, disappointed at the scene, mumble and walk away, leaving Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai: Dude, this is the best day in my life.

Rigby: That's exactly what I was gonna say.

(Episode ends)


(Episode opens with Pops sitting down by the creek. He takes a deep breath.)

Pops: Oh, look. A squirrel.

(He sees a brown squirrel up on a branch. A butterfly flies over to give it an acorn, and the squirrel gnaws on it. It then bends over to the ground to drink some water provided by a fish in the creek. The squirrel then stretches out and starts taking a nap. Birds fly over it with a leaf in their beaks and they place it on the squirrel.)

Pops: I admire you, Mr. Squirrel. You're in perfect harmony with nature. I am also one with nature. In fact, I wrote a poem about being one with nature. Ahem. (Places a blade of grass over his eyes) A brow of grass, (Places moss on head) and hair of moss. Puddles are my dipping sauce. (Runs across the creek) A petal, a wing, an arm or two, presenting a hug from me to you! (Prepares to hug the bush, but gets prickled by a thorn) Oh! (Bees stings him) Oooh! (Wind picks up and a branch hits him. He runs away from the bush while holding his head. He falls into the creek, where snapping turtles start biting him.) Oh why, nature? WHYYYYYYYYY?!!

(Cut to the park house TV. A dude is shown surfing at the beach.)

Announcer: Surfers love riding the waves, but they also love having fun.

(Cut to a surfer on the shore at night)

Surfer #1: Ahahaha, brah. You see Duke in that last wave, brah?

Duke: Brah, I tried to pull out, brah.

Surfer #3: Dude, brah. You were just so deep in that barrel, I was like, "Brah!"

(The three surfers laugh. Mordecai and Rigby are watching this. Mordecai laughs while Rigby is eating chips.)

Mordecai: Is that really how they talk?

Rigby: Haha, yeah. "Brah. Hey, brah. Sup, brah. Brah-brah-brah-brah-brah."

Mordecai: Haha, yeah. What a bunch of losers. (Rigby gobbles up the chip crumbs) Dude, did you just eat the last of the chips, dude?

Rigby: Relax, dude. It was just crumbs.

Mordecai: Yeah, dude, but you ate the last of the chips before you ate the last of the crumbs, dude. When am I supposed to get my chip on? (Pops walks in, crying from earlier) Woah, Pops, what's wrong?

Pops: Oh, I'm just having a bad day with nature, I suppose. You mind if I sit here with you guys for a while?

Mordecai: Of course not.

Rigby: Yeah, take a loadoff.

(Pops sits down. Cut back to the surfing show.)

Surfer #4: Catching your first wave, it's just like, "Ahh"! I mean, I don't wanna sound like I'm bragging or whatever, but I really just feel sorry for dudes who can't ride waves. Cause you just pop up on that board, and you're just in it. (Starts riding a surfboard with seagulls around him) Just totally one with nature.

Pops: Oh, boy! (Starts clapping) That's what I have to do to be one with nature: surfing! (Cut to the City Beach. Pops holds up a book.) "Peachy Perry's 3 P's to Surfing Perfect". (Opens book) The 3 P's are: (Watches a surfer) paddling, pivoting, popping up! Seems easy enough. (Starts paddling on his board) Paddling. (Sand goes on dudes and dudettes) Pivoting! Popping..(Tries to gets up but fails. Three surfers come over to him.)

Hurl: Haha. Gramps can't even get up on his board.

Pops: Salutations, fellows. (finally gets back up) My name is Pops.

(The surfers laugh)

Hurl: What kind of stupid name is that?

Pops: What's your name?

Hurl: Hurl Hurlbutt. And these are my associates, Murl and Burl.

Murl: Hey, we should call this guy Mondo Cabezo.

Burl: Hey, Mondo Cabezo, can I rub your head for good luck?

(He and Pops laugh)

Hurl: Hey, Mondo! I think I can see your family on the water!

(Points to the round buoys. He and his friends laugh.)

Pops: I am as mother nature made me, sir.

Hurl: Mother nature gave you the worst body for surfing ever, brah!

Pops: (Holds up book) Peachy says anybody can catch a wave with enough practice.

Hurl: Uh, yeah. Peachy's dead. (Snickers)

(The three surfers laugh at Pops when they notice the other surfers going to catch a big wave)

Hurl: Primo surf. (The four grab their boards) Whoo! Yeah! (Noticing Pops) Ugh, get outta here, Mondo! You're gonna harsh our ride!

Pops: No! (Groans as the waves splash him) Paddle! Pivot! (Turns away from the wave) Pop up!

(Pops is dragged deeper into the wave and ends up knocking the three surfers off of their boards. Pops is washed ashore, and Hurl and his friends are standing over him, glaring. Pops nervously smiles and waves before screaming and running to Carmenita, flying off as all the surfers drive him away from the beach. Cut back to Pops's house, where Mordecai is with Rigby holding a tennis ball. Rigby chuckles.)

Mordecai: (Moving the ball) Dude, quiet. I'm trying to focus.

(Throws the ball onto the garage switch, causing the door to go down onto a perfectlly placed pencil) 

Mordecai (continued): Hahaha. Garage beats pencil.

(They high five just as Pops arrives)

Rigby: Uh, how'd surfing work out for you, Pops?

Pops: Hideous! Not only did I not become one with nature, but I made surfer enemies.

Mordecai: Maybe it's better if you just forgot the whole surfing thing.

Rigby: Yeah. Try sticking to lollipops and fanciness. Your comfort zone. I mean, look at me! I've never left my comfort zone, and I'm doing great!

Mordecai: Plus, those jerk surfers basically proved they're not one with nature if they ran you off the beach.

Pops: (Shakes his head and puts on his hat) Oh, Mordecai. I don't mean to offend your reasoning, but surfers are most certainly one with nature. The fine people who live inside the television do not lie.

Mordecai: Uhh, no offense taken, but maybe you can at least take a break from the other surfers for a while, until you get the hang of it.

Rigby: Yeah, you're rich. Why don't you just build a beach here at the park?

Pops: Oooh, Rigby, that's brilliant! (Claps hands) And you and Mordecai can import dolphins for atmosphere!

Mordecai: Ok... (Scratches his chin)... or maybe just a wave machine for the lake?

(Cut to the Park lakefront, where the Wavy Train has been called.)

Wavy Train Guy: Wave on!

(He cranks the newly added wave machine up, causing the waves to build. Pops begins paddling.)

Pops: (laughing) Watch, this everyone!

(He turns the board around as he draws into the wave.)

Mordecai: You think this is gonna work?

(Pops starts to pop up, but is too late as he is tumbling over the wave. He splashes in. He swims back over to his board and waves to the guys. When he tries to hop back on, he struggles around.)

Rigby: Lookin' good, Pops! (to Mordecai) Yeah, this is never gonna work.

(Pops has faced away from the wave again. He goes over the wave and drowns underneath, where he get sucked into a pipe. This blocks the water from the machine.)

Mordecai: Uh-oh.

(We cut to Pops in his room with Dr. Henry and Benson with the guys.)

Dr. Henry: So you were saying Pops was surfing out on the park lake.?

Benson: Yes. He, uh, wanted to be one with nature or something, I don't know.

Dr. Henry: Well, we can't have that.

(He walks over to Pops' x-ray.)

Dr. Henry (continued): Just look at tis x-ray. Jumping to a standing position, with a head of this size, put too much strain on the feeble spine. Like trying to hold a bowling ball on a stick of angel hair pasta. Pops, I have to recommend that you stay on land.

Pops: But...but I'll never become one with nature on land!

Dr. Henry: Let me put this in terms you'll understand.

(He pulls out a lollipop from his pocket.)

Dr. Henry (continued): This is your body. And this is your body on surfing.

(He cracks the lollipop.)

Dr. Henry (continued): Any questions?

Pops: Well, I thank you for your medical opinion, Dr. Henry, but I intend to keep chasing said waves until I chase one down and then ride it!

(Clock trainsition)

Dr. Henry: But I'm trusting you boys to keep him off that board come morning.

Mordecai: Don't worry, we'll stay up all night and guard the door.

Rigby: Yeah, he'll never make it past our security team.

(Mordecai and Rigby place chairs on either side of the door and sit on them with their arms folded.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!

(A split second later, they fall asleep. We cut back to the park lake, where Pops has somehow escaped outside to try surfing again. When he pivots from the wave, he sees Hurl Hurlbutt coming through.)

Hurl: Alright! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Ahahaha! 

(The other two surfer friends are there with him.)

Hurl (continued): You were right about the sweet break at this place, brah.

(Pops stumbles over the wave like before. He rides back around the wave and the surfers.)

Hurl (continued): No chop no sharks...(spots Pops) Ahh! How'd Mondo Cabezo find out about our wave, brah?

(Pops gets back on his board.)

Pops: This is my wave.

(Cut back to the house. Mordecai wakes up from sleeping. He notices Rigby drooling and screams. Rigby wakes up.)

Rigby: What?

(They get up.)

Mordecai: We fell asleep?!

(Mordecai opens the door to Pops' room.)

Rigby: Dude, there's no way he got past us. Plus his head is too big to fit through the win-

(It's revealed that Pops sawed a big hole in the wall big the windows to escape. Mordecai and Rigby scream at this, scream at each other, and run out. Back on the lake, Hurl and the surfers are harassing Pops, surfing around him.)

Hurl: Get off our wave, Mondo!

(Pops falls off his board, his head in the bottom.) The other groundskeepers are at the scene with Mordecai and Rigby.)

Benson: What's going on?

Mordecai: Pops is in trouble!

Benson: To the lake boats!

(They run to get them while the surfers keep surfing at Pops.)

Benson (continued): Hey! Get away from him! 

(The groundskeepers are rowing the boats towards the surfers.)

Hurl: Brace, brahs!

(The surfers get knocked off their boards and bashed on their heads with oars. The groundskeepers cheer as they swim off to land.)

Murl: Hurl! We gotta call for reinforcements!

Hurl: Let us perform the ancient call of the surfers.

(The three surfers grab bongos from their van.)

Hurl (continued): (laughs gleefully) Wipeout.

(They play the call on their bongos, and Murl then points a signal in the sky. Random vehicles with dudes and dudettes in them, along with a band arrive at the park lake. They get out of their vehicles, hop on their boards and get in. Two surfers get into the lae windsurfing. Skips begins fighting them.)

Skips: There's too  many of 'em!

(The park workers start getting trampled by the surfers, and knocked into the water. Pops follows the surfers as they approach the wave.)

Groundskeepers: Pops, no!

Hurl: Time to crank this baby up to 11.

(Hurls cranks the wave machine up, causing the wave to rise up and push all the surfers, except Pops, offboard.)

Pops: Pivot, pop- ooh!

Benson: We gotta help Pops!

(The park workers swim off to stop the 3 surfers, while Pops is hanging onto his board for dear life, whimpering.)

Hurl: Mondo?! Get him off there.

(Murl and Burl surf off to Pops.)

Pops: Pop... up....

(The two surfers begin to try and knock Pops off his board, while Hurl is laughing.)

Mordecai: Hey!

Benson: Hand it over!

(Hurl immediately cranks the machine "Gnarly to the MAX" when Mordecai punches him in the face, causing him to drop the control and fall off, crushing it in the process. This in turn causes the wave machine to explode, knocking the park workers away. The wave gathers up all the water and rises up, and Murl and Burl fall off. The water shoots up into the sky, and comes back down, emerging as an ultimate wave, Pops being the only surfer on it. The wave rushes towards the park workers and the surfers. The dudes and dudettes run for their lives.)

Murl: The ultimate wave!

(He and Burl proceed to ride it, but Hurl stops them.)

Hurl: No brahs, it's suicide to ride that wave. Let Mondo have this one.

(Pops screams and desperately holds on.)

Mordecai: Pops! If you wipe out, you'll die!

(The park workers and the 3 surfers run off screaming as the wave draws in even closer.)

Pops: Pop up, Pops! Ride the wave, Pops! But, but I'm so afraid! Afraid of those rufians, afraid of my body failing, but mostly I'm...I'm afraid of you, nature! Why have you been so mean to me? Well, whether you like it or not, I'm gonna ride this wave!

(Pops finally pops up on his surfboard and laughs joyfully. The park workers cheer him on. He continues to dance and laugh.)

Pops: Finally! I'm one with nature!

(He begins to glow.)

Hurl: No way!

(As Pops continues to surf on the ultimate wave, he is joined by a flock of seagulls. A sun shines over the wave, a rainbow appearing. A shadowy figure is seen in the wave, revealing itself under Pops to be a humpback whale.)

Humpback Whale: (speaking through subtitles) Pops...You have passed the test. You are one with nature once more.

Pops: Let's never fight again! Ooh!

(The whale shoots water out of its spout, sending Pops really high, spinning while surfing. Four dolphins rise out of the wave. Hurl and his friends are standing on the van watching the nature scene.)

Hurl: Man, this was a bust. Let's go get some fish tacos.

(Before they can leave, however, the four dolphins crush them. The park workers are stunned at what they are seeing.)

Mordecai: Do you think he'll ever be back?

Benson: He's with nature now, Mordecai. He's with nature.

(He wipes tears from his eyes. Pops continues to laugh as he surfs off through the city with the seagulls, while unknowingly leaving it wrecked.)

(End of Catching the Wave)

(The episode starts with Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost watching internet videos)

Rigby: You guys haven't seen "blargh.avi" yet? We're watching it!

(the screen shows a video)

Girl: (she has a dog on a lead) Go! (The dog jumps and makes her fall) Blargh!

(everybody laughs, but Benson quickly slams the door open)

Benson: Nailed ya!

(everybody screams)

Rigby: We were using the computer for business purposes!

Benson: You don't think I know about Funny Video Fridays, but I know! (he laughs) You're gonna get such a write-up!

Mordecai: Quick! Put something on Benson'll like!

(Rigby quickly types and a cat video comes on)

Benson: (his pupils grow) Wha-?

Mordecai: Heh-heh. It's a cat video, Benson.

Benson: Cat Video?

Rigby: Here's another one!

(he clicks on a video of a cat playing)

Benson: Whoa! When did they start making these?

Rigby: A long time ago, Benson.

Mordecai: There's millions of them.

Benson: People just put up videos of their cats? On the internet?

Rigby: That's right, man. So just sit down for an hour or two and catch up.

Benson: I love cats. (he sits down)

(everybody leaves the room, except Mordecai)

Benson: So all I have to do is click on these cats?

Mordecai: Yep. Just focus on the cats and not on the write-ups.

Benson: Write, what?

Mordecai: Exactly. (he quickly leaves the room)

Benson: (watching a cat video) Whoa-huh-huh-huh! (he laughs)

(The Next Day)

Rigby: Sorry, sorry. I know I'm late to the morning meeting.

Skips: Don't sweat it. Benson isn't even here yet.

Rigby: That's weird.

Mordecai: Yeah. He's never late.

(Benson shows up sleep deprived)

Mordecai: Did you stay up all night watching cat videos?

Benson: Sure did. (chuckles) Did you know, there are internet cat celebrities? There's Fat Cat, Rat-a-tat Cat, and Mari, the Japanese cat that likes boxes. But my personal fav, is Curmudgeon Cat. (Bensons shows a video of Curmudgeon Cat's owner waving its paw and the video freezes.)

Benson: Ugh, piece of junk! (snaps his fingers and gasps) I've got to get a new phone! (He starts to leave)

Mordecai: Uhh.

Muscle Man: Uhh, Benson? We need our assignments.

Benson: Oh, right! Pops, you're in charge for the day. (He gets in his car and drives away)

Pops: I'm assigning you all old timey dances! (starts dancing)

Skips: This is bad. And Mordecai and Rigby are responsible!

Rigby: What are you talking about?

Muscle Man: You got Benson into cat videos you get him out. Those are the rules.

Rigby: Hey, I got an idea. Lets just wait until Benson snaps out of it.

Pops: My legs feel like wet noodles! (continues dancing)

Mordecai: We better go check up on him.

(cuts to Bensons apartment where he is laying on a couch watching cat videos and pouring a bowl of cereal and McFluffin interrupts)


Benson: McFluffin... I'm trying to watch a video about cats.

(McFluffin leaps off Benson spilling the cereal)

Benson: Hey... I wasn't done with that. (he tries to reach for it then pours milk and cereal into his mouth) Now, where were we? (Benson watches more cat videos) Aww, he thinks he's people. (advertisement pops up)

(Needs completion)

(The episode starts off at the Park as the camera pans overview to Mordecai and Rigby walking to the park's cave, chanting excitedly.)

Mordecai: It's time for cave-party times, baby!

Rigby: Aw yea-yuh! Let's get this camp fire going!

(The scene transitions to Mordecai and Rigby roasting marshmallows on the fire)

Mordecai: Dude, it's gonna burn. Dude seriously, it's gonna burn. You're gonna burn it.

Rigby: STOP IT!!!

Mordecai: You're burning it right now.

(The marshmallow catches on fire.)

Rigby: Aw, man!

Mordecai: Dude, I told you.

(Due to the fire, a block of ice nearby starts to melt. In the next scene, it shows Mordecai and Rigby partying, playing music, and drinking soda, while the block of ice continues to melt.)

Mordecai (continued): Dude, where do you see yourself in 10 years?

Rigby: Easy, I'm gonna be a stuntman.

Mordecai: (laughs) Dude, that's so lame. You'll probably still be working at the park.

Rigby: STOP TALKING!!!!!!

(In the next scene, the block of ice starts to melt and we can see a man's head on top of the block of ice while Mordecai and Rigby are playing video games.)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai, ever think we should bring in another friend?

Mordecai: You mean, like a third person? I guess we keep our inner circle pretty small. But it's not like we're ever gonna find anybody cool enough for the park, so...

Rigby: Yeah.

(Mordecai and Rigby are in there sleeping bags.)

Mordecai: (Yawns) Good cave party dude.

(They both fall asleep the camera moves to the block of ice, which finally melts completely. A man opens his eyes walks towards Mordecai and drip of waters fell on Mordecai's face that wakes him up and look up.)

Mordecai: (screams) Rigby...wake up. Rigby! Rigby! Rigby, wake up!

(Rigby wakes up and sees the man and screams)

Mordecai: (whispers) Dude, just keep quiet!

(The man then comes out of the dark and grunts. Mordecai and Rigby scream and come out of their sleeping bags.)

Mordecai: STAY BACK!

(The man hits the radio and it turns on. He begins to dance.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa! Dancing caveman!

Mordecai: This guy is awesome!

(The caveman looks at Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: Dude, you're awesome!

(The caveman gives a thumbs up to Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: Looks it time to go from "Mordecai and Rigby" to "Mordecai, Rigby and Dancing Caveman".

Mordecai and Rigby: Third friend!

(Scene trasitions to the Snack Bar, where the caveman is chugging cheese.)

Mordecai and Rigby (continued): Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Whooooo!

(The caveman yells in the same accurate manner. He tries to activate the machine but nothing happens.)

Mordecai: Anyone who can chug that much cheese is cool in my book.

(The caveman grabs the machine and throws it out of the bar near two kids. They run off screaming. Benson arrives witnessing the scene.and grunts.)

Benson: Who is that?

Mordecai: He's our new friend. Dancing Caveman.

Benson: "Caveman"? No. No. No way. I'm not having a caveman at the park. We aren't insured for it.

Mordecai: What? That's not fair!

Rigby: Yeah, we can't just get rid of him!

Benson: A caveman cannot fit into this modern world.

(The caveman squeezes a ketchup bottle and a mustard bottle into his mouth. He throws the bottles at Benson, who blocks them with the clipboard.)

Benson (continued): See?

Mordecai: But he's one of us now.

Benson: Really? What's his name?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhhh....

Benson: Get rid of him!

Rigby: But he'll die out there all alone. Come on, Benson!

Mordecai and Rigby: Pleeeeease?

Caveman: Ben...sooon?

Benson: Fine. You have a week to get him civilized.

Mordecai and Rigby: Nice!

Mordecai: Thanks, Benson.

Benson: But if he isn't up to park standards in a week, I'm calling the pound!

(He walks offf.)

Mordecai: We're gonna need some help.

(Scene cuts to Pops' house, where Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, Fives, Skips and Pops get the caveman to be civilized. They bring a chalkboard to the kitchen. He is taught Lauguage, Technology, Health & Hygiene, Laws, Music, and a bunch of other aspects of lifestyle. Later, while  everyone is talking, the caveman comes down the stairs, revealed to be in clothing.)

Skips: That is the most civilized caveman I have ever seen.

(The caveman laughs.)

Caveman: Please, call me Gregg.

(The guys are impressed as they walk to him.)

Pops: Good luck with the Benson test, my good man.

(Everyone but Mordecai and Rigby leave.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is perfect! Benson will totally let you stay.

Rigby: Pfft, yeah! He'll probably offer you a job.

Mordecai: Alright, let's go.

(They start to walk off.)

Gregg: Wait. Me know you work hard to help, but me not civilized.

Rigby: Huh?

Gregg: You forgot something.

(He goes to the chalkboard  and writes "love".)

Rigby: Love?

(Gregg nods.)

Gregg: Me submit that I can't be truly civilized until me find other half.

Mordecai: I don't know. Is there enough time to find it before our meeting with Benson?

Gregg: Certainly.

(Scene cuts to the park cave. Gregg leads Mordecai and Rigby through it, holding a flaming torch.)

Gregg (continued): Her name Diane.

(He bangs on the side.)

Gregg (continued): She frozen with my people.

(The three stop.)

Mordecai: How many of you were there?

(Gregg smashes a breakable wall, and they continue.)

Gregg: We were many.

(Gregg is standing before many blocks of ice with people concealed in them.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoaaaa.

(The three walk across them.)

Mordecai: How do we find her?

Gregg: It will be easy. She only cavewoman here. Her beauty sine like star.

(He stops at the sight of the mentioned cavewoman.)

Gregg (continued): There she is. My Diane.

Rigby: Are you sure you wanna do this? Her forehead looks pretty big.

(Mordecai punches him.)

Rigby (continued): Ow!

(Gregg holds the torch up, causing Diane's block of ice to start melting. Cut back to Pops' house.)

Gregg: Diane. How I have missed you.

(Scene cuts to a room in the house where Diane is sitting on a chair with a towel wrapped around her as she and Gregg are having a conversation.)

Diane: Eh?

Gregg: My love thousands of years, and today begins anew. Mordecai and Rigby give us an hour to catch up. What do you want to do?

Diane:  (makes grunting noises)

Gregg: Oh! We can't do that. It's more civilized time, now.

Diane:  (makes grunting noises as she is to say "You look strange!") 

Gregg: Well me may look strange, but it's a way of time. Me have to change. You will have to change, too.

Diane:  (makes grunting noises angrily)

Gregg: It not so bad look at these, pants. (Shows his pants to her) Pretty wild, huh? And that's television.

(A TV shows a car and a police car crashing into each other. Diane sees this and destroys the TV with a chair)

Gregg: Oh, my! (He goes to her with a tray with two cups of tea) Here, have some tea, calm you down.

Diane:  (makes grunting noises as she is to say "I don't know you anymore!")

Gregg: What you mean you don't know me anymore?

(Diane slams the tray with the cups of tea into Gregg's face and she goes bursting trough the walls)

Gregg: DIANE!

(We see Diane running as she is running through a road where a car is stopping and she punches the car, then another car stops as she continues to run to the park cave, holding a flaming torch, and she holds the torch up, causing the other cavemen's block of ice to start melting. Cut back to the room where Gregg is looking at his reflection in the mirror. Gregg touches his forehead, making realize who and what he is. He slams the objects into the floor until he calms down and breathes)

Gregg: What am I?

(Mordecai and Rigby enter the room)

Mordecai: Gregg? Where's Diane?

Gregg: We... we going through some stuff right now.

Mordecai: Benson's waiting.

Gregg: Me not ready.

Mordecai: But you'll go to the pound if you don't.

Rigby: There only two things that happen there, and you don't want them.

Mordecai: You'll do fine.

Gregg:  (inhales and exhales) Okay.

(A crashing noise and Pops screaming are heard outside. They go down to see what's going on, and the other cavemen Diane defrosted start attacking the park. Three cavemen attacked Skips' car while Skips retreats, then the other cavemen chase the people away. One caveman punches a fish in the fountain and grabs it, and two cavemen destroyed the fountain with a bench. Diane is riding on a white horse as the horse neighs and snorts. Diane snorts and looks up.)

Diane:  (makes grunting noises, giving the other cavemen the signal to attack)

Gregg: Diane, call them off!

Diane:  (grunts as she is to say "No!")

Gregg: What do you mean "no"? Tell me why you do this.

Diane:  (makes grunting noises as she is to say "Because of the pants you're wearing right now!") (The horse neighs as she leaves with it)

Gregg: Uh... We going through some stuff right now.

(Two cavemen destroy a wire post, then three cavemen attack the snack bar. Muscle Man closes the snack bar window as he and Fives are inside. A caveman snorts and struggles to open the door.)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro!

(He goes into a cabinet to hide, then Hi Five Ghost phases through the cabinet to hide. The three cavemen go inside the snack bar and start to trash it. Skips punches the cavemen, then he dodges the caveman's hit with his club, then another caveman tackles Skips. An animal control truck came with two dog catchers coming out of the truck and sees the chaos the cavemen are doing. One caveman appeared at the dog catcher's face and he grabs the dog catcher's arms and rips them.)

Dog Catcher: I need a new job.

(One cavemen is chasing the two kids as Mordecai, Rigby and Gregg run through the ruined fountain)

Gregg: Caveman too strong and too many. You lose your jobs. Park destroyed. All my fault.

Mordecai: Come on, Gregg! We can do this. We just need use out brains to think up something.

Gregg: Wait! In my time, my people value meat above all. Do you have meat?

(Cut to the three guys in the cart with a big chunk of meat tied on the top of the cart as the cavemen start to chase after it.)

Rigby: It's working!

(As they stop near the basement, Gregg grabs the big chunk of meat and the three lead the cavemen into the meat locker where Gregg drops the big chunk of meat and the cavemen enter the meat locker to eat their meal. Gregg looks at Diane who is eating the meat.)

Gregg: Diane.

Mordecai: Greg! Come on! let's go!

Rigby:  Come on! Get out of there!

(Gregg thinks for a second)

Rigby: Come on, Greg! What are you doing? You're running out of time!

Mordecai: Get out of there! Come on! Get out of there!

Gregg: Me sorry. (closes the meat locker door) Diane.

Diane:  (makes grunting noises. "What are you doing?")

(Gregg removes his clothes)

Gregg: What must be done. I'm sorry, Diane.

Diane:  (makes grunting noises. "Gregg... I thought I lost you.")

Gregg: You almost did. But you were right. It wrong to give up self.

Mordecai and Rigby:  (as they are pounding the meat locker door) GREGG!

Mordecai: Dude, unlock the door! Get out of there!

Gregg: Thanks for helping me. But me not belong in modern world.

Rigby: You could've been happy here!

Gregg: No. No need TV, no need pants. (Diane comes up to him) Need Diane.

(As the other cavemen begin to freeze, Gregg and Diane begin to freeze, and Gregg sets the temperature to a higher level)

Mordecai and Rigby: NO!!!

(As Gregg and Diane are about to kiss, he looks at Mordecai and Rigby and gives them a thumbs up until they are completely frozen. Mordecai and Rigby begin to sniffle, tears in their eyes.)

Mordecai: Gregg. Thanks for being our friend.

(As Mordecai and Rigby leave the basement, Benson approaches them.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Benson!

Benson: I saw everything. I had Greg all wrong. He gave up all for true love. In a way, he was more civilized than all of us. Mordecai, Rigby, clean up this mess. Do it... do it or you're fired. (Leaves the scene, about to cry.)

Rigby: Greg was pretty cool. Do you think we should find another new friend?

Mordecai: Hmm. Nah. Two's good enough.

(Episode ends)

(The Park is seen being piloted towards Lolliland. Mordecai and Rigby enter the house, and Rigby starts beatboxing. They walk up to Pops)

Mordecai: 'Sup, Pops!

Rigby: What's good?

(Pops bursts into tears)

Mordecai: Um, you okay, Pops?

(Pops teleports outside of the House and continues crying)

Mordecai & Rigby: Whoa!  

(Pops walks off crying)

Mordecai: Uhh...

Rigby: What the?

(Cut to Skips, who is on the roof of the House, catching a parasite, Pops walks near on the ground)

Skips: Agh! Gotcha, you stupid parasite!

(Skips throws the parasite away and notices Pops. He waves to him)

Skips: Hey Pops! Gotta catch those things before they destroy the ship and kill us all.

(Pops starts crying again, turns invisible and runs off)

Skips: Uh, okay...

(Pops is seen getting himself together, walking through the Park, When Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost suddenly show up in a space cart) 

Hi Five Ghost: Hey Pops! Wanna go on a supply run with us?

Muscle Man: On the way, we're gonna see how close we can fly to a Sun!

(Pops starts crying again, and levitates away)

Muscle Man: Uh, okay! Your loss, bro!

(Transition to inside the house. Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Skips and Eileen are all trying to figure out why Pops is sad. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost both enter the room, with a very obvious sunburn)

Mordecai: Guys, we gotta figure out what's got Pops so bummed out.

Rigby: Maybe he just misses Earth stuff, like wrestling and 2 ply toilet paper?

Skips: Maybe it's because we have to drink recycled garbage water all the time?

(Muscle Man, who is drinking water at the time, spits it out)

Muscle Man: Wait! We drink what?

(Everybody, aside from Eileen, argues about why Pops is so upset)

Eileen: Um, guys? (clears throat) You think maybe Pops is sad because in less than 24 hours, we'll reach lolliland, where he'll have to face Anti-Pops, his super evil twin brother, and figure out how to save us and the entire universe from being erased from existence?

Mordecai: Yeah, it's probably that one. We need to get his mind off all that. Before the battle tomorrow, let's make it our mission to show Pops a good time.

(Everybody positively responds to Mordecai's proposal. Transition to outside, Mordecai and Rigby are with Pops. They have a song for him)

Pops: A song? For me?

Mordecai: Yeah!

(Rigby starts beatboxing)

Mordecai: Looking good Pops, cool new magical abilities!

(Mordecai starts beatboxing)

Rigby: And I've always been impressed by your fashion sensibilities! 

(Pops laughs and claps)

Mordecai: So cheer up, Pops! There's no need to cry!

Rigby: You'll fight Anti-Pops tomorrow and you probably won't die!

Mordecai: You're gonna win the fight, so 'til then let's have some fun!

Rigby: And if you don't, well that's alright! We'll all be erased from existence anyway.

Mordecai: Dude!

(Mordecai punches Rigby, as Pops starts crying) 

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: Sorry, I couldn't think of a rhyme.

(Cut to Benson, Eileen and Hi Five Ghost walking up to Pops in the kitchen. They have a cake shaped like Pops' head)

Benson: Hey Pops...!

Eileen: Surprise!

Hi Five Ghost: We made you a cake!

Pops: A cake? For me?

Benson: It's your favorite! Red velvet with raspberry filling! Let's cut you a big old piece!

(Benson cuts the cake with a knife, but it leaks out with red filling, looking like blood)

Eileen: This'll make you feel better!

Pops: Uhh...

(Pops looks at the cake, as it starts talking)

Cake: Help me...

(Pops bursts into tears. Cut to outside with Muscle Man and Skips, they have some fireworks)

Skips: Hey Pops! Check it out!

Muscle Man: Here comes the big show!

(Muscle Man lights the fireworks)

Skips: Run!

(Skips and Muscle Man run behind Pops)

Pops: Ooh, I love firing works!

(The fireworks get set off, as Pops admires them)

Pops: It's beautiful.

(An Earth firework appears in the sky, which is then destroyed by another firework, causing Pops to break down into tears again. Cut to everyone, minus Pops, back in the house again)

Muscle Man: Well that was a total bust!

Rigby: We were doing fine until your stupid fireworks!

Muscle Man: What are you talking about? Those fireworks were very festive!

(Muscle Man shoves Rigby)

Rigby: No, they weren't!

(Muscle Man and Rigby fight each other)

Muscle Man: Yes, they were! They were totally freaking festive!

Mordecai: That's it! Guys, I know what we've gotta do! What's the one thing guaranteed to cheer anybody up?

Muscle Man: The wet burrito combo platter at Chimichanga Ones?

Mordecai: What? No.

Skips: I don't know, it's pretty good.

Hi Five Ghost: I really like how wet they make it!

Mordecai: No, guys! I'm talking about a surprise party!

(A montage begins. Mordecai and Rigby invite people on Spacebook to their party, meanwhile the cake trio from earlier are preparing in the kitchen. Hi Five Ghost and Eileen are making a new Pops cake while Benson is making his infamous microwave wings)

Benson: Microwave wings! Microwave wings!

(Gary and the Guardians of Eternal Youth are seen arriving at the Park Dome. Skips answers the door)

Skips: Hey, you made it!

Gary: Bummer about the whole end of the universe deal. Oh, we brought chips!

Reginald: Honey barbecue and zesty lime!

(Death rings the doorbell, which Rigby answers to)

Rigby: Hey Death! Thanks for coming out.

Death: Oh, it's no problem. I was in and out here anyway!

(HD DVD and Blu-ray ring the doorbell, which Skips answers to)

HD DVD: He-hey!

Skips: Glad you could make it!

HD DVD: Of course! And we brought some HD DVDs we thought Pops might enjoy.

Blu-ray: To use as coasters, then we can watch some of my movies, as they're meant to be seen, on Blu-ray!

HD DVD: Come on! I thought you said you'd give me that one!

Blu-ray: Yeah, but those discs aren't gonna cheer anyone up, they're literally trash.

Skips: Heheh, okay...come on in!

(Transition to Muscle Man watching Pops walk towards the house, Muscle Man pulls out a walkie talkie to communicate with Benson)

Muscle Man: The eagle's approaching the nest.

Benson: Got it. Everyone, get in position!

(The lights are off and everybody hides, Pops walks in and the lights turn on)

Everyone: Surprise!!

Pops: Oh my! A party? For me?

Rigby: Yeah, Pops! For you!

Pops: How lovely! And all of my friends are here. Oh, but what's the occasion? It's not my birthday.

Mordecai: Hey, you don't need to have a reason to have a party!

Pops: Well, then let's get this shindig started! (laughs)

(Montage of the party. Everybody is dancing, Pops walks over to drink from his plastic cup and smiles as he looks at all of his friends enjoying themselves. He starts getting emotional, and runs outside)

Mordecai: (singing) Oh yeah! 

(Everybody cheers)

Mordecai: Alright! Let's get Pops up here. Come on up, Pops! Pops?

(Mordecai notices Pops crying outside through the window. Everybody exits to see him crying on the steps)

Mordecai: Hey Pops, you okay?

(Pops looks up at Mordecai with tears streaming down his face)

Pops: Oh, yes! Jolly good party! Just getting some fresh air!

Rigby: Oh, well that's cool then! We thought you were having some sort of emotional breakdown.

Mordecai: Rigby!

(Mordecai punches Rigby)

Eileen: Pops, you know we're here for you.

Pops: I know. I'm sorry, it's just seeing you all together. All my good friends. If Anti-Pops wins tomorrow, everything will be erased, and I don't care what happens to me, but I don't want any of you to get hurt. You're my best friends.

Death: (sniff) I don't normally mix myself up in the affairs of the living. But in the battle tomorrow, you can count on my help.

Pops: Oh, I can't ask you to do that.

Oswald: Ridiculous! You're our friend, Pops.

Gary: Yes, and leaving you to face Anti-Pops by yourself would be totally uncool.

(Everyone supports Pops)

Pops: Good show!

Mordecai: Wait, I have an idea. When I finished high school, our class buried a time capsule full of moments for us to dig up at our ten year reunion, to see what we each put in it! What if we all put something personal in a time capsule, and shot it in space! That way, no matter what happens, there'll always be a part of us floating out there, forever.

Pops: Mordecai, that's a splendid idea! Good show!

Rigby: Yes! I can totally relate to wanting to do that now that I'm a high school graduate! But what would we even put in it? Like, our favorite chips or something?

Blu-ray: I can help with that! I can copy everyone's memories of their entire lives and put them in a Blu-ray boxset!

HD DVD: Uh, I can do that too if you guys want.

Blu-ray: Uh yeah, but your lives will look way better on Blu-ray.

Mordecai: Yeah, we should just go with Blu-ray.

(Everybody excitedly speaks amongst themselves as they get ready)

HD DVD: Show-off...

(Blu-ray transforms into her sentient form)

Blu-ray: Hey Benson, mind helping me get this thing started?

Benson: Uh, sure.

Blu-ray: Come on around back here, and pop open that little panel on my back.

Skips: Ooh, ever since we got to space, Benson's been killing it with the ladies!

(Mordecai laughs, while Benson tries to figure out which button to press, he starts sweating)

Benson: Uhm...

Blu-ray: Yep, there you go. Almost got it...

Benson: (breathing heavily) Huh, there's so many buttons back here.

HD DVD: Hey! I only have one button over here! You can't miss it!

Blu-ray: You guys will need to stay still once the process starts, it can be dangerous and disorienting. There's lasers involved. Don't touch the lasers!

(The panel at the back of Blu-ray beeps)

Benson: Found it!

Blu-ray: Good job, Benson. I knew you'd find the button eventually.

(Benson blushes and walks off)

Blu-ray: Memory scan commencing. 

(A laser beams from her belt and begins to scan the lives of Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Eileen)

Blu-ray: Now hold on, guys. This might hurt a little bit!

Mordecai: Wait? What -

(Everybody's memories start getting sucked in the air to create the Blu-ray disc. Multiple shots from past episodes can be seen)

Rigby: Whoa!

Pops: We can see everything!

(Everybody admires what they're seeing. A compilation of Benson's freak-outs start showing up around them)

Mordecai: Dude, I think most of these are of Benson yelling.

Benson: No, they're not! 

(he realizes that it's true, and starts to growl. A shot from "The Christmas Special" of Pops wrestling a polar bear shows up)

Hi Five Ghost: Whoa! Remember when Pops wrestled a bear? That was awesome.

(Multiple memories from Skips' past show up)

Skips: Good times...

(A compilation of Muscle Man's "My Mom" jokes begins)

Muscle Man: (laughs) Bros, are you not hearing this? I'm killing it! (laughs)

Mordecai: (laughs) Hey Rigby, check it out...

Rigby: What?

(Mordecai points to a shot of Rigby's "one cheek wonder" buttcheeks from "Death Punchies". Everybody laughs)

Rigby: Stop laughing! (screams) Don't look at that!

(Rigby runs towards the shot of his butt to hide it, everyone warns him to stop. Rigby ends up hitting one the laser shot of his butt, and causes the whole process to go wrong, with Rigby starting to float into the sky)

Rigby: What's happening? I can't stop!

Mordecai: Rigby! Blu-ray, turn off the laser!

Blu-ray: I can't! The process won't stop until it's done recording. You know, I was very clear about not touching anything!

Mordecai: Hold on, Rigby!

(Mordecai runs over to Rigby to save him)

Benson: Mordecai! What are you doing?

(Mordecai grabs Rigby's leg)

Mordecai: I got you, dude!

Rigby: Dude, I'm slipping!

(Mordecai begins to float along with Rigby)

Eileen: Guys!

(Eileen runs over to them and grabs Mordecai's ankle)

Rigby: Aw yeah, Eileen!

(Eileen starts floating too)

Skips: Come on!

(Everyone aside from Pops runs towards the trio, Pops whimpers. Everybody ends up floating and are no longer connected)

Everyone: (screams)

Pops: Oh no!

(Pops, still grounded, uses his telekinesis powers to keep everybody from floating any higher. It works)

Rigby: Aw yeah, Pops!

Pops: I don't know how long I can hold on!

Mordecai: The memories are catching up! We're almost done, Pops!

(A shot of the plant creature from Space Creds appears)

Rigby: Dude, that killer plant was cool!

(Shots of the current episode start showing up, meaning that the boxset is almost at completion)

Mordecai: Look! It's us right now.

(The final still frame gets recorded. The Blu-ray lasers disappear and everybody falls down to the Park ground)

Rigby: Whoa, that was awesome, Pops!

(Everyone complements Pops, who blushes)

Pops: Oh, it's nothing! Blu-ray, did it work?

Blu-ray: Recording...complete!

(A Blu-ray boxset featuring all of the characters exits Blu-ray)

Blu-ray: Everyone's memories saved onto their own commemorative Blu-ray!

Mordecai & Rigby: Cool...!

Skips: They've even got our faces on them! Pretty neat.

Blu-ray: Your entire lives are contained on these discs. I even took the liberty of compiling a few bonus discs. This disc is two hours of bloopers, and this one I call "Mordecai Pulls a Mordecai". It's a two-disc set!

Mordecai: What do you think, Pops?

(Pops cries, and everyone looks in fear towards him)

Pops: Don't worry! These are tears of joy! Now, no matter what happens, our friendship and all of our jolly good times will never be forgotten!

Rigby: That's great, Pops. Now, let's blast those discs into outer space!

(Cut to the statue of Curtis Montgomery, which has been taped up to some fireworks and the boxset. Muscle Man is getting ready to detonate them)

Muscle Man: In five, four -

Hi Five Ghost: Wait! What if the person who finds the discs doesn't have a Blu-ray player?

(Everyone worryingly talks amongst each other)

Blu-ray: Don't worry, I've got it.

(Blu-ray makes straining noises while producing a Blu-ray player. Everybody looks disturbed as a Blu-ray player hits the ground)

Hi Five Ghost: Wait! But what if the person who finds the time capsule doesn't have a big-screen TV?

Blu-ray: I can push one of those out!

(She starts pushing out a TV as everybody freaks out. Cut to the statue again, which now has the Blu-ray player attached too)

Muscle Man: Fire in the hall!

(Muscle Man detonates the fireworks, but it goes wrong and the statue crashes into the House)

Mordecai: Or...we could just bury it in the Park.

(Episode begins at the Park Managers' Lodge. Gene is starting a meeting.)

Gene: Alright, alright. Everybody settle down. The annuat Park Managers' Lodge $50 Chili Cook-Off will be this weekend, and as always, the cost of your ingredients cannot be more than $50.

(Benson is sitting at the apprentice table with two other lodge members, drinking from an orange juice box.)

Gene (continued): Day 1 will be an elimination round, and Day 2, finalists will complete in a no-holds barred arena match. Celebrity chef Sean Ben Pimento will judge.

(The lodge members talk amongst themselves.)

Gene (continued): The winner will get the undivided respect of the entire lodge!

(The lodge members cheer.)

Benson: (gasps) Respect...(stands up) I want to enter!

(The lodge members gasp.)

Park Manager #1: Benson, no!

Park Manager #2: Gene wins every year.

Gene: Ah, let the apprentice enter. Not like he's gonna beat me.

(The lodge members laugh.)

Park Manager #2: Let's have a preemptive celebration in Gene's honor!

(The lodge members rush off to celebrate, leaving Benson alone.)

Benson: (quietly) I gotta win this chili cook-off!

(Cut to Mordecai, Rigby and Skips at the Snack Bar.)

Mordecai: So I saw my 5th grade teacher at the grocery store yesterday.

Rigby: What?

(The episode starts with Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Eileen in the living room, dressed in Christmas sweaters)

Hi Five Ghost: First ever Christmas in space, guys!

(Hi Five Ghost drinks a cup of hot chocolate)

Hi Five Ghost: First Christmas hot chocolate in space!

(Muscle Man eats some peppermint bark)

Muscle Man: First time eating Benson's peppermint bark in space!

Benson: My first time making peppermint bark in space! To be honest, the process is pretty similar to the Earth version, but somehow it just tastes better up here!

(Benson eats some peppermint bark)

Benson: Yep, there's only one way this Christmas could be any more special.

Eileen: If we finally receive a message from our loved ones telling us they're alright, and we'll see them again before we die?

Rigby: Eileen! He's talking about telling cool Christmas stories!

Mordecai & Rigby: Ho-ho-ho-ohhhhhhhhhhhh!

Benson: Well, that's really more of a Halloween thing. What I'm talking about are cool Christmas stories in the form of a song - carols!

(Benson reveals a handbell)

Benson: And handbells, huh? I'll sing the chorus then you guys pick it up! Ding-dong, ding-dong -

(Skips stops Benson's handbell)

Skips: Let's save the bell-jingling for when you're by yourself. Until then, I've got a story about an icy snow planet called Celsius. 

(The story starts with the Park crew in a space cart, ready to visit the planet Celsius)

Skips: Now remember, we can only stay while there's sunlight, and Celsius only has sunlight for five minutes! Because if you're here after it gets dark...

Muscle Man: Yeah yeah, the Celsian Snow Monsters will get us. You told us that like ten times already!

Skips: I'm just making sure you understand the premise of this place!

Rigby: But we haven't seen snow in forever!

Mordecai: Yeah, snow's what makes Christmas "Christmas".

Rigby: That and presents!

Everyone: White Christmas! White Christmas! White Christmas!

Skips: Alright, alright!

(Skips flies the cart onto Celsius, which is dark and windy)

Benson: Five minutes, everyone! Starting...now!

(Benson presses on his stopwatch, as the wind goes away and sunlight appears over Celsius, making it a winter wonderland. Everybody murmurs excitedly)

Rigby: Five minute snow day!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are seen having a snowball fight. HFG laughs as he throws a snowball into Muscle Man's face. Rigby and Eileen laugh as they make snow angels. Pops laughs as he is seen in a snow fort)

Pops: Hahaha! Look!

(Pops points to some Celsian Snow Monsters, who appear very cute and happy)

Celsian Snow Monsters: Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

(Everyone mutters excitedly over the snow monsters)

Benson: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Alright, cute don't stop the Sun from setting! Come on. Let's get a white Christmas move-on!

(Montage of everyone having fun on Celsius. Pops kisses a Celsian Snow Monster under some mistletoe, then claps. excitedly. Muscle Man eats some of a snow monster's Christmas cookies. Mordecai, Rigby and Eileen go snow tubing down a hill. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost drink hot chocolate with a snow monster. Everybody opens gifts. Mordecai gets a Sno-Cone Maker, Rigby gets a two-wheel scooter, Eileen gets a customized Rubix Cube with pictures of Rigby on it, which she finishes within seconds. Skips is seen pretending to be a snowman which the snow monsters cuddle onto. When they have a minute and a half left, Benson accepts a Christmassy necklace off a snow monster)

Benson: Okay, that was fun. To the dome, everybody!

(Muscle Man is seen at the top of a hill in his underwear)

Muscle Man: But wait! I haven't done the Sorrenstein Hanukkah tradition of skiing down a big slope in my underwear!

Benson: Well make it quick! We only have like ten seconds left before the Sun sets!

Muscle Man: Relax, bro! Here I go!

(Muscle Man goes down the slope, but he loses his grip and starts screaming as he falls to the ground, his leg is twisted.

Benson: Oh, come on! You're fine, get up! We don't have time for this!

(Muscle Man cries on the ground)

Rigby: I don't know - it looks a little twisted?

Benson: You can walk.

(Benson's stopwatch beeps, and Benson gasps)

Benson: Oh no.

(The Sun sets and Celsius becomes dark again. The cute snow monsters turn into giant Celsian Ice Monsters)

Snow Monster: Merry Chri-STMAS! RAWGH!

(Everyone screams)

Benson: Back to the ship, back to the ship!

(Skips carries Muscle Man, and everybody runs back to the Cart)

Snow Monster: MERRY CHRISTMAS! 

Hi Five Ghost: Almost there! Just keep running!

(HFG and Pops scream as two Snow Monsters block their path)

Snow Monsters: MERRY CHRISTMAS!

(The guys quickly notice that they're surrounded by snow monsters, all yelling "MERRY CHRISTMAS")

Hi Five Ghost: Okay, I'm not really sure what to do now!

Benson: There's only one thing we can do! Use your presents as weapons!

(Everybody throws their presents at the Celsian Snow Monsters)

Benson: It's holding them off! Keep throwing stuff!

(Eileen throws her Rubix cube at some snow monsters)

Rigby: Eileen! I spent a long time customizing that for you!

(Mordecai throws his Sno-Cone Maker)

Rigby: Mordecai! I had to special order that from the Sno-Cone Machine Planet!

Mordecai: I know! And I really appreciate it, but - Christmas isn't about gifts!

Rigby: What?! Yes it is!

Mordecai: Dude, what are you gonna take with you when this is all over?

Rigby: The stuff?

Mordecai: No! The memories!

(Everybody continues throwing presents at the Snow Monsters, who dodge them all)

Snow Monster: MERRY CHRISTMAS! MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Mordecai: What Christmas is really about it spending -

Rigby: Spending money?

Mordecai: No!

(Mordecai gets knocked to the ground, and Eileen screams)

Rigby: Mordecai! What's it about?

Mordecai: It's about spending time with friends!

(A light is suddenly projected next to the gang, as a stiff reindeer named Ludlow emerges towards the planet)

Pops: Ludlow the Laser-Nosed Reindeer?

Ludlow: That's right, Santa sent me! He said he's sorry he couldn't be here, but he's super proud of you guys for realizing the true spirit of Christmas!

Benson: Whoa, it's really him!

Rigby: He looks just like himself!

Ludlow: Merry Christmas, guys! I'll take it from here.

(Ludlow fires lasers from his nose at the Snow Monsters, melting them all, while the Park gang talk amongst each other excitedly)

Everyone: Thanks Ludlow!

Ludlow: No problem, see you guys on the next Christmas special!

(Ludlow flies away)

Everyone: Whoa!

Mordecai: So realistic!

Rigby: He barely has to move!

Eileen: Stiff as a board!

(Cut to everybody in the cart, flying away from Celsius)

Skips: Well, what did you guys think?

Rigby: Considering we got our white Christmas, made it out alive, and I didn't have to sacrifice my awesome new two-wheel scooter, I'd say -

Everyone: Best Christmas ever!

(Rigby's scooter explodes, ending the story)

Benson: Was that supposed to be heartwarming? Because it was really more scary than anything.

Skips: I thought it was good.

Benson: Oh, come on! Snow Monsters, laser-nosed Rudolph rip-off! If we're gonna tell Christmas stories, which I maintain is an inappropriate means of celebration, they should at least be wintery stories like this one!

(Story begins in a galaxy of Christmas asteroids, the Park Dome flies passed)

Benson (narrator): We were flying through a Christmas-themed asteroid field.

Benson (story): Open your next gift, Skips!

Mordecai: This one's from me and Rigby. We pulled all our gifts this year.

Rigby: That way, if one of us forgets, you can just write your name on the card, and nobody knows! I learned it from my dad.

(They pass the present to Skips)

Skips: Uh, thanks.

(He opens it, and...)

Skips: It's a bazooka.

Mordecai & Rigby: Merry Christmas!

Skips: What am I supposed to do with it?

Mordecai: It's a T-Shirt cannon!

Rigby: Yeah! They use them at Monster Truck Rallies to keep unruly fans at bay! 

(Rigby grabs the T Shirt Cannon)

Rigby: From now on, whenever some jerk gets out of control, you can be all "Hey punk, safety not guaranteed! 

(Rigby fires the cannon and it hits Pops in the face)

Pops: Oh.

(Pops reads the T Shirt, which says "Flap your wings, change the world". He sheds a tear)

Pops: What a wonderful message.

Skips: Agh, that's all the gifts. Merry Christmas, everyone.

Mordecai: It's cool we found this asteroid field where they celebrate Christmas all the time. I wish we could have got some snow, though.

Benson: Forget snow! I wish we could get some carolers!

(Everybody effortlessly agrees. Cut to outside where a Space Caroler is seen floating, trying to find somewhere to sing carols to, but there are signs at all the steroid homes saying "No Carolers!" and "Seriously No Carolers! No!", but he then sees the Park Dome, where no signs are present, he smiles and floats towards it. Cut to back inside the House)

Hi Five Ghost: Look, all I'm saying is the odds of a caroler knocking on the door right now are slim to none!

(A knock is heard at the door)

Benson: Uh, was anyone expecting company?

(Mordecai walks to the door and opens it, to see the Space Caroler)

Mordecai: Uh, hey dude. Nice jacket.

(The caroler strums his electric guitar and floats into the living room)

Caroler: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWH!

Mordecai: Uh, I think it's a caroler.

Caroler: On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: a partridge in a pear tree!

(A partridge in a pear tree appears)

Rigby: Are those pears? I haven't had fruit that wasn't freeze dried since we left Earth!

(Rigby walks towards the pear tree)

Eileen: Hmm...

Rigby: You're cool with me, mysterious space dirt bag!

(Rigby goes to take a pear, but gets attacked by the partridge)

Rigby: Agh! Get it off! Get it off!

Eileen: Rigby!

Benson: Hahaha! I like this guy.

(Rigby opens the window and throws the partridge out of it)

Rigby: Dude, what -

Caroler: WAAAAAWH! On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree!

(Two doves appear on the caroler's shoulder, and the partridge reappears on the pear tree, attacking Rigby again. Benson laughs, but he's then attacked by the two turtle doves)

Benson: Agh! Get 'em off! Get 'em off!

Mordecai: Okay, dude. Thanks for the show but you gotta -

(Mordecai goes to grab the caroler, but then gets kicked away)

Caroler: WAAAAAAAAWH! On the third day of Christmas -

Everyone: No!!!

Caroler: - my true love gave to me: three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree!

(Three French Hens appear, as well as an additional two turtle doves and another partridge, who once again attacks Rigby. The hens start attacking Pops, who cries and falls over. The turtle doves attack Skips and Benson, the latter is trying to shoo them away with a broom)

Benson: What do we do, what do we do!?

Skips: I -

(Benson accidentally hits Skips in the head with his broom)

Skips: - don't know!

Pops: Excuse me!

(All of the birds start attacking Pops, as he screams. Benson jumps towards the caroler, who dodges, causing Benson to slam against the floor)

Caroler: On the fourth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: Four calling birds, three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree!

(As the caroler keeps mentioning the birds, even more of them start appearing around the living room, attacking everybody)

Rigby: Why does this song have so many birds!?

Mordecai: Agh!

(Mordecai looks towards the caroler and runs towards him)

Caroler: OOHHHHHH!!! On the fifth day of Christmas - 

(Mordecai grabs the caroler)

Mordecai: Shut up!

Caroler: - my true love gave to me: Five golden rings!

(The Caroler punches Mordecai in the face, with five gold rings)

Caroler: WAAAAAAAAA -

(Time card - 7 verses later. We see Pops running from six geese throwing eggs, Mordecai and Rigby are hiding from pipers)

Mordecai: Look out!

(Benson is seen drumming on a drum kit, against twelve drummers, whose drumming throws Benson against a wall. Eileen enters the bathroom with a toilet plunger, where she finds some swans behind the shower curtain, and screams. Muscle Man is seen running through the corridor, dodging all of the different characters, but is then kicked by a cow being milked by a maid)

Mordecai: This is crazy! How do we get rid of this guy?

Rigby: I don't know! What makes a caroler leave you alone?

Mordecai: Uhhh - oh, dude! Cookies! My mom always gave them cookies and they'd go away! Everyone! We. Need. Cookies!

(Pops gets a bag of cookies out of his drawer, Eileen empties her stocking which is full of cookies, Skips gets his secret cookie stash from out of the toilet, and goes to where everybody is seen putting their cookies in a sack)

Mordecai: It's for the greater good.

Skips: The greater good.

(Skips puts his cookies in the sack, and Mordecai puts it on his back)

Mordecai: Santa's not the only one eating cookies tonight. But we're all out of milk, so these babies are going down dry.

(The caroler is dancing on the floor)

Caroler: Partridges! Partridges! Par-

(He notices Mordecai running towards him, so he quickly gets up and grows while laughing. He suddenly grows four more pairs of arms, all of which are holding hand bells)

Caroler: Hand bell breakdown!

(The caroler plays the hand bells, then attacks everyone with them. Everyone is blasted towards the wall, when Skips suddenly notices his T-Shirt cannon from earlier)

Skips: Hmm.

(Skips runs towards him and jumps to grab his guitar off him, which he smashes against the ground)

Skips: Cookies, now!

(Mordecai screams, and throws the cookie sack to Skips, who quickly pours some cookies into the T-Shirt cannon)

Skips: Come get some -

Caroler: AGHHHHH!

(The caroler runs towards Skips)

Skips: - cookies! 

(Skips fires the cookies into the Caroler's mouth. He gets blasted to the ceiling, and falls to the ground. He then crawls over to Skips)

Caroler: It's - all I've ever wanted! Thank you. WAAAAAAAA -

(The caroler explodes along with all the birds and characters from the song, turning into snow)

Skips: You said you wanted snow.

(The screen fills up with snow as the story ends)

(Benson is seen ringing a hand bell)

Benson: Now that's a Christmas story! Am I right?

Mordecai: Dude, you're not gonna make hand bells cool!

Muscle Man: Yeah, stick back the agenda, bro!

Benson: Handbells represent the purity and togetherness of the holidays, you idiots!

(Benson rings the hand bell)

Benson: They sound like angels whispering, and if you can't get that through your skulls - that's on you! Not me. We need more peppermint bark, I'll be right back.

(Eileen picks up a Rigby shaped peppermint bark and eats it)

Eileen: Think we should go check on Benson?

(Everybody looks into the kitchen where Benson is grumpily eating peppermint bark, while muttering)

Benson: Hand bells...

Rigby: Ah, let him cool off in there!

Mordecai: Yeah. Besides, we've got another Christmas story. It starts off just like this.

Rigby: Yeah, only Benson's in a good mood!

Benson: Hey, I heard that!

(Benson runs into the living room dressed as Santa Claus with a sack on his back)

Benson: Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Santa's got lots of presents for each and every one of you! One for Muscle Man...

Muscle Man: Yeah!

Benson: One for Fives and Eileen...

Hi Five Ghost: Oh boy!

Eileen: Alright!

Benson: One for Skips...

Skips: Hmm!

Benson: One for Pops...

Pops: Ahh!

Benson: - Wait no, this one's for Skips again. You must've been extra good!

(Pops groans disappointedly)

Benson: Pops' present is...well, I know it's here, Santa had his little helpers get it for him...

(Pops waits with his arms wide over as the camera pans to Mordecai and Rigby, who stare at each other. Cut to the hallway, where Benson is yelling at Mordecai and Rigby)

Benson: You were supposed to get Pops' present weeks ago! I even made a packet specifically telling you: What he wants, where to get it, how much it was, who to talk to!

(Rigby is seen skipping through the packet)

Rigby: That's too many instructions! You confused us.

Mordecai: What were we getting again?

Benson: An old-fashioned typewriter! Just go get it now, or Pops will be crushed! Look at him.

(Close-up of Pops' face, he's trying not to cry)

Pops: P-p-present?

Rigby: But it's Christmas! All the malls are closed.

Benson: There's one mall open - theoretically.

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby flying the cart through space)

Mordecai: Benson said it was around here somewhere.

Rigby: Ugh! How are we supposed to find this place if it's theoretical.

Mordecai: Wait, look!

(Mordecai and Rigby notice a giant spinning door that stops for them to go through)

Rigby: Do we go in?

(The door opens, as the duo fly in, and scream through a dimensional portal. Suddenly, the cart disappears and Mordecai and Rigby find themselves on the floor)

Mordecai: Huh? Where are we? Where's the cart?

Valet: Took care of it for you! Valet services, you see.

Mordecai: Hmph, that's convenient.

Rigby: Is this the mall?

Valet: You could say it's a mall. Theoretically. What brings you two here? Last minute holiday shopping, I take it?

Mordecai: Bascially we're here to buy an old-fashioned typewriter.

Valet: Ah, those are on the fifth floor - or should I say the fifth...dimension.

Mordecai: What?

Valet: Now, now. We've got many floors and dimensions to get through.

(The valet walks into the elevator with Mordecai and Rigby, and sends them up the fifth floor. They arrive at the first floor)

Valet: First floor, first dimension!

(The door opens and Mordecai and Rigby scream as they turn into straight lines. The door shuts as they return to normal)

Mordecai & Rigby: What was that?

Valet: Ah, it's all a part of the ride. Dimensions and so on.

(They arrive at the second floor)

Mordecai: Phew, this seems normal.

(Mordecai turns and is flat and 2D)

Rigby: Ah! 2D!

(They arrive at the third floor, where they are 3D CGI models of themselves floating to the air)

Rigby: Cool!

(They arrive at the fourth floor, where everyone is a hyper-realistic versions of themselves)

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph!

(They hi-five, as the doors close and they go to the fifth floor)

Mordecai: Finally, the mall! Whoa dude, they have fro-yos here! We should totally get fro-yo after this!

(Mordecai and Rigby walk into their bedroom, with Rigby holding a package)

Rigby: Package from the internet!

Mordecai: What is it? What is it?

Rigby: (gasp) It's a voice modulator that makes you sound like... (in movie trailer voice) ...a movie trailer voice over guy.

Mordecai: This is so cool. Wait, wait. (in movie trailer voice) For two best buds, one amazing package changed their lives forever.

(They laugh. Clock transition to Muscle Man grilling without his shirt)

Movie Trailer Voice: In a world where it's considered okay to grill outside with your shirt off...

Muscle Man: What the...what's going on?

(Cut to Benson closing his lunchbox)

Movie Trailer Voice: Coming soon, one man eats a sad lunch by himself.

Movie Trailer Voice: Pops Maellard is the man in the tiny hat, and he's got a mustache, and now he's running away.

Movie Trailer Voice: In a world, where Mordecai and Rigby thought it was cool to imitate movie trailer voiceovers. 

Mordecai: What the?

Mordecai & Rigby: Was that--?

Movie Trailer Voice: Coming this summer, [as the ground shakes] Earthquakes, [The ground starts to crack apart, and a hole was made that made Mordecai and Rigby fall through it, and they find themselves wearing adventure hats, in a ancient temple, when they see a killer snake.] Killer Snakes, [The scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby, who are completely wet, inside a submarine with two holes with water coming through them.] The most deadly submarine ever built, [The scene cuts to a giant turtle monster attacking the city.] Giant Monsters, [The scene then cuts to Mordecai and Rigby, again, but this time they're running away from an airplane.] Thrills, [Then Mordecai and Rigby, as shadows, see the shadow of Nosferatu,] Chills, [Then Mordecai and Rigby are in pilot uniforms in a jet, giving each other a handshake.] and Navy Skills, [Then the scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby getting into Benson's Car, and then they drive off.] One movie trailer voice is turning nature, into a nightmare, [Mordecai and Rigby notice a cliff up ahead.] And these two guys are getting there. [Mordecai and Rigby scream as they go over the cliff in Benson's Car, then the scene freeze-frames, and then a movie title appears as the Movie Trailer Voice says it.] Just Desserts. Wait, I... I think I can come up with something... cooler... uh... [Another movie title appears as the Movie Trailer Voice says it.] X-treme Payback. No, that's... maybe too vague. [Another movie title appears as the Movie Trailer Voice says it. This time, it's a very long movie title.] Fatal Vengence: The Mordecai & Rigby Story: The Spectres Within: The Curse of the Dark Stone: Revengeuppance 2000. Nailed it. [The scene resumes as Mordecai and Rigby resume screaming in Benson's Car as they fall all the way down the cliff, and then they crash down at the bottom of the cliff, and then, when the smoke clears up, Mordecai and Rigby are back in their room in Pops' House, on the floor, coughing, realizing that everything was just a nightmare. Then, the scene cuts to the last scene of the short, where the Movie Trailer Voice reveals his true form, which is a man in a black suit, but with a microphone as a head.] Never mimic my voice again. [The short ends when the Movie Trailer Voice leaves Mordecai and Rigby's room, and closes the door, but completely off-screen.]

Mordecai: Ready for some more cartin'?

Rigby: You know it!

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what?

Rigby: Where's the cart?

Benson: It's at the shop! After your little excursion yesterday, your cart privileges have officially been revoked!

Mordecai: But these bikes are for little kids!

Benson: Hey, you want to act like kids, this is what you get.

Rigby: But we're not going to look cool riding kids bikes around.

Benson: What?! You want to know what's cool? Doing your job. Respecting park property. You're to work, not be cool!

Mordecai: Well, fine. It doesn't matter if we don't have the cart. We can be cool no matter what. I mean, with some maintenance, and some new paint, these bikes will be so cool.

Rigby: Yeah! And then you'll have to admit that we're cool too.

Benson: Heh. Yeah, right. The day I admit you're cool is the day I give you back the cart.

Mordecai: But we are cool.

Benson: No you're not.

Mordecai: Okay, how about this, if we can get you to admit that we are cool, then you have to give us the cart back.

Benson: Sounds good to me, because it will never happen.

Rigby: You're wrong! You're all like, "that'll never happen", and then we'll get all cool, and then you will be like "Whoa!" and then we'll be like "In your face!"

Benson: [laughs] And I'll be all like-- (turns red) GET BACK TO WORK!!! [walks off, mad]

Rigby: Dude, we can totally get Benson to admit we're cool.

Mordecai: Yeah dude.

Mordecai: Hey Benson, check out our cool new rides.

Rigby: Bet you think we're pretty cool huh.


Benson: What? How many times do I have to tell you two you are not cool! Now get back to work! Argh! [walks off]

Woman: Muscle Man, what are those things?

Muscle Man: Those are losers, baby. You don't want nothin' to do with those.

Muscle Man: Later grandmas!

Mordecai: Dude, it's time to do some shopping.

Muscle Man: Hey dorkwads!

Muscle Man: Huh? (in awe) Woah, you guys actually look kinda cool.

Rigby: That's unexpected!

Mordecai: Woah, thanks bro!

Benson: Hey, quit murmuring excitedly! These two are not cool.Rigby: Dude, Benson, just admit it.

Benson: You'll never be cool no matter how many trendy clothes you wear.

Mordecai: You don't know how wrong you are.

Benson: Get back to work, all of you! [mumbling] Argh, I can't believe they're carrying on with all this...

Skips: Come on Benson, you gotta admit they do look pretty cool.

Benson: Yeah right. I don't have to admit anything.

[A montage of Mordecai and Rigby buying clothes from 'Das Coolest' and failing to impress Benson repeatedly plays. As Mordecai and Rigby bike up to Benson, they are surrounded by a crowd of people in awe]

Mordecai: Admit it, Benson.

Benson: No, you're not cool.

Mordecai: How 'bout now, Benson?

Benson: No. When are you guys going to get it through your heads? Nothing you say or do will ever make me admit you're cool.

Mordecai: You know what, Benson? I just realized something. We don't care what you think.

[A white beam surrounds Mordecai and Rigby. The crowd gasp and murmur in awe. The beam dies and two men appear]

Man: Freeze, you're under arrest.

Mordecai: (exasperatedly) For what?

Muscle Man: For being too cool.

Men: Chill out!

Mordecai: Dude, where are we?

[Gary sits down next to Mordecai and Rigby]

Gary: You're in intergalactic cool court, gentlemen. And it's quiet a mess you've gotten yourselves into.

Man: Everybody welcome Judge Broseph Chillaxton!

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Mordecai and Rigby, you are being tried for crimes against coolmanity. Opening statements.

Prosecutor: Dig this, Your Honor. These cats have thrown off the balance of cool in the universe! [snaps and makes a blue grid appear] The concentration of cool is so dense at the park it will implode into a coolness singularity, a black hole in which no coolness can escape. [simluation of the black hole plays] These dudes [points at Mordecai and Rigby] are too cool! And they must be punished.

Mordecai: Dude, this is crazy!

Rigby: Yeah, we just wanted to be cool enough for Benson to give us back the cart!

Gary: Listen, just let me do the talking, guys.

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Defense, your statement.

Gary: Your Honor, my opponent is surely mistaken. One only needs to look at my clients to see they're just not that cool. We plead not cool and ask that the charges be dropped.

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Very well, you may call your first witness.

Gary: I would like to call Muscle Man to the stand.

Muscle Man: Wh-wh-where am I?

[Gary walks up to Muscle Man]

Gary: Muscle Man, where were you the morning of March 18?

Muscle Man: [laughs] I passed those dweebs on their lame bikes.

Gary: Would you say they looked cool?

Muscle Man: [laughs] No way! They looked like losers.

Gary: Yes precisely, uncool losers! Prosecutor your witness.

Prosecutor: Uh, Mr. Man, where were you only a few days later?

Muscle Man: I don't have to answer that.

Prosecutor: Permission to treat this cat as hostile?

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: I'm cool with that.

Muscle Man: (sweating profusely) I saw them again and admitted they looked pretty cool.
Prosecutor: Ma-ha-han, teleport this fool outta here.

Gary: Yikes.

Das Coolest Employee: Yeah, those dudes are the most uncool dudes ever. At least, that's what I would've said before those dudes became the coolest dudes ever. (becoming excited) They brought tons of business into my store. I've got numerical evidence [pulls out money] right here! Check it out, son!

Gary: Uh, no further questions. [walks away]

Prosecutor: Please place your hands on this stack of rare Brain Explosion 45s.

Prosecutor: Now do you cats swear?

Mordecai and Rigby: [puts their other hands up] We swear.

Prosecutor: They swear! Ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing cooler than that!

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Dude, nice.

Prosecutor: Thanks, Your Honor!

[Judge Broseph Chillaxton and Prosecutor fist bump]

Rigby: Dude, Gary!

Gary: Objection!

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Overruled!

Prosecutor: Overruled, judge, or is it overcooled?

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: (to the court stenographer) Can you read that back to me?

Court Stenographer: Overruled, judge, or is it overcooled? [repeats riff with mouth]

Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen in the audience, take a look at yourselves, go ahead, look. Ironic t-shirts, hat stacking, mesh gloves? These cats started all that! Trend setters can make even the uncoolest things cool. Check exhibit A.

Prosecutor: Yes, these bikes are lame, but I ask you, how did you all get to court today?

Prosecutor: The prosecution rests.

Gary: Well I'm out of ideas. You know anybody who really thinks you guys are uncool?

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: In light of this new evidence and the fact that the prosecution's testimony was pretty awesome, I am prepared to make a ruling.

Gary: Your Honor, I have a surprise witness.

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Huh?

Prosecutor: Objection! Surprise witness' are uncool.

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Just roll with it, bruh. I'll allow it.

Gary: I would like to call Benson to the stand.

Benson: Huh? Wha? Oh, it's you two. What have you gotten yourselves into now?

Gary: Benson, having known the defendants longer than any other witness, you're in a special position to judge the coolness of my clients, are you not?

Benson: Yeah? I guess?

Rigby: I hope this works.

Mordecai: Dude, he'll never admit it. We're home free!

Gary: Benson, are Mordecai and Rigby cool?

Benson: [laughs] Are those guys cool? [laughs again]

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Benson, this is no joke dude. The fate of the universe hangs in the balance. Answer the question and remember, lying under oath is not cool.

Benson: (defeatedly) Mordecai and Rigby... are the coolest guys I know.

Mordecai: Oh no.

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Members of the court, the testimony given to us has proven quite clearly that the defendants are guilty of being too cool. The sentence: death.

Benson: What!?

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Take then away.

Rigby: (whimpering) Please..!


Mordecai: (whimpering) No!

[A gavel and a Brain Explosion 45 suddenly hit the men. Pans to Benson constricting Judge Broseph Chillaxton]

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!


Benson: Get on the bikes, now!

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Not cool, bro!
Benson: Go!

Judge Broseph Chillaxton: Stop them!

[Mordecai, Rigby and Benson pedal around hallways being chased by men until they find the exit. Outside, there is a teleporter with a man standing beside it.]

Man: Freeze!

[Benson throws a pair of ice cubes dangling from a Lady Justice at the man and board the teleporter shortly before two men appear]

Man 1: They're getting away!

Man 2: Stop!

Mordecai: Court is adjourned, losers.

Rigby: Woohoo, we did it!


Mordecai: Dude, Benson, that was so cool of you to help us escape like that.

Rigby: Yeah, so cool man!

Benson: [laughs] Thanks guys, coming from you that means a lot.

Mordecai: Heyhey, so you admitted we're cool. You're gonna give us the cart back now, right?

Benson: [laughs] No.

(Episode begins with Rigby looking at his cell Phone seeing the words "Trust no one" written on the screen. Rigby puts his phone down and sees a spaceship heading towards the park dome. The garage door to the dome opens and the spaceship goes into the dome)

Benson: Get inside!

(The spaceship door opens and a set of steps are automatically placed down onto the floor of the Park Dome. We see smoke come out of the air and three shadows which look like robots appear. Every park member runs into the house. 

(The episode begins in a store named Fast N' Easy and Mordecai, Rigby, Thomas and Pops buying a slushy to take photos of their faces after drinking the slushy)

Mordecai and Rigby: (opens the door) Sluuushyyyyyy! (Mordecai pays for the slushy and Pops takes the slushy)

Rigby: (holding the camera) Reaadyyy?

Mordecai: Let's do thiiiyuuuuus! (drinks the slushy while the 3 cheers "Brain Freeze!" repeatedly) ("Brain frozen" then makes a weird face and taken a photo)

Rigby: (drinks the slushy and also made a weird face after being "brain frozen" and taken a photo)

Pops: (drinks the slushy then kneels to the ground and reached his head then laughs) Ahhahahahaaa, brain freeze! (also makes a weird face then taken a photo with)

Thomas: Haha, here I go! (drinks the slushy but didn't make any weird face like the other did. The slushy didn't "brain froze" him then laughs and taken a photo)

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops looks at the photo for a bit then laughs)

Mordecai: Dude Thomas, you call this a brain freeze face?

Rigby: Weak-saaaauce!

Pops: I agree, jolly weak show.

(The 4 of them laughed)

Thomas: Okay. (pauses for a bit) Wait, wait, wait! (opens the top of the cup and chugs the whole slushy but nothing happens and just laughed)

Rigby: Dude! What is wrong with you?

Thomas: Dudes, dudes! I got this, I got this. (goes inside the store) Hey man, what's the coolest slushy you got?

Cashier: Uhh, They be the cool cubed. It's imported from the arctic and contains real glaciers, but I strongly recommend that you reconsider- (Thomas cuts him off.)

Thomas: I'll take it. Big swig size.

(The cashier gets the big swig cup, puts on goggles, gloves and puts the slushy to standard to cool-cubed.)

Cashier: Go easy on this bro.

(Scene cuts to the outside of "Fast N' Easy" and Mordecai, Rigby and Pops are saying "Chug! Chug! Chug!" repeatedly while Rigby is holding the camera for the picture. )

Thomas: Okay. Okay. Here it goes.

(While Thomas goes for it, ice goes up to the tip of the straw and then he sips it while the other three keeps repeating.)

(When he finished, nothing happened and he is calm again.)

Rigby (unamazed): Lame.

(Thomas suddenly got a "brain freeze" face but is frozen still by the cool cubed slushy.)

Rigby: Ah dude!

Mordecai: Take the picture! Take the picture!

(Rigby takes the picture and the three of them laugh.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is gold!

Rigby: Thomas, check it out!

(Thomas saids nothing then falls down then Rigby chuckles while taking more pictures of Thomas's "brain freeze" face.)

Mordecai: Now that's a brain freeze. Alright, come on.

(The three walk away but notice Thomas is still on the floor.)

Mordecai: Thomas? Come on.

Rigby: Lets go.

Pops: Thomas?

(They all get worried and look at each other.)

(All of them come to him.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Thomas?! Thomas?!

Mordecai: (touches his head) Ahh! Dude! He's not coming out of his brain freeze!

Rigby: Is it supposed to last that long?

Mordecai: I don't know! (holds onto Thomas's arms) Thomas! Thomas!

Pops: What do we do?

Mordecai: We have to unfreeze him.

(Scene cuts to the restroom, where Mordecai opens the shower curtain, Rigby turning a shower nob to hot. Then, Mordecai puts Thomas in the shower but, Thomas leans to the wall but, Mordecai puts him back correctly.)

Mordecai: Hot towel.

Pops (feels the heat of the towel): Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

(gives Mordecai the towel and he puts it on Thomas's head.)

Rigby: Check him! Check him!

(Mordecai checks, but Thomas is still frozen.)

Mordecai: Uhh! This isn't working! He's playing cold or somehow!

(Scene cuts to Skip's home while Skips opens the door and they showed up for his help.)

Skips: Bring him in. Hmm...Yeah I've seen brain freezes before, but not as bad as this. (nods his head) This is beyond my medical knowledge. Luckily, I know a guy who can help. He's been treating Pop's family for generations.

Pops: Oh, of course! Dr. Henry!

Mordecai: Lets call him.

(Next scene shows Dr. Henry's car flying down to the front of Skip's house.)

(Pops opens the door and it's Dr. Henry.)

Pops: Oh, Dr. Henry! So good to see you!

Dr. Henry: Hello Pops. How's that old pinkie of yours?

Pops: Pop-notch! (chuckles).

(Dr. Henry checks Thomas's ear which is approved to be filtered with ice.)

Dr. Henry: Hmm. So, he drank a slushy, you said.

Mordecai: Yeah.

Dr. Henry: Did you make him drink it?

Rigby: Uhh...maybe?

(Dr. Henry doesn't seem convinced.)

Rigby: Yeah, we did.

Dr. Henry: Can I see the cup?

(Rigby gives the cup to Dr. Henry.)

Dr. Henry: Hmm. (makes a sound with his tongue.) Cool cubed, Big swig size. This is quite a pickle. Well, I got some good news and bad news. The good news is that the core of Thomas's brain isn't completely frozen yet which means, there's still a chance to throughout.

Mordecai: Okay. What's the bad news?

Dr. Henry: The bad news is that the cool cubed slushy is still very active, it's working its way to the brain core as we speak. If it gets there, Thomas's brain will stay frozen. Forever!

(Three of them gasp in horror.)

Mordecai: What do we do?!

Dr. Henry: Simple. I just shrink you to little tiny people then you go inside of Thomas and you can stop the cool cubed slushy before it reaches the core. It's a dangerous procedure but, it's the only way to save him. Any volunteers?

Rigby: (to Mordecai) Well, you and Pops have fun.

(Mordecai punches Rigby.)

Mordecai: No dude, we got Thomas into this mess, so we're gonna get the mess out of him! (unsure if that made sense) I think.

Dr. Henry: Okey dokey! Lets get started!

(Dr. Henry gets the shrinking machine out of his suit case.)

Dr. Henry: The shrinking won't last forever, so take this alarm. (Rigby puts on the alarm to his wrist.) When it goes off, you will grow back to normal size so move quick! You'll also need this. (holding a small speck)

Rigby: It's just a speck!

Dr. Henry: Shh. Its what's inside the speck that counts. It contains all the equipment to thaw the core including a transporter, which would bring you back, just push the red button and poof! You'll be back safe and sound.

(puts the speck in the tube.)

Dr. Henry: Now. In you go.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm!

(They go in the shrinking machine.)

(Dr. Henry presses the buttons to make them shrink.)

Dr. Henry: Oh! I forgot to tell you. Shrinking is extremely painful.

Mordecai and Rigby: WHAT?!

(Mordecai and Rigby scream from their regular voices into a miniature voice and go into the tube.)

Dr. Henry: Remember, just five minutes to save Thomas and get out.

(He puts them in Thomas's head.)

Pops: Oh, Dr. Henry, what will happen if they don't make it in time?

Dr. Henry: Well, it's hard to say Pops, yours comes to worst, they just take very long naps.

Pops: Ooh! I love long naps! (chuckles)

Dr. Henry (to Skips whispering): That means they're going to die.

(Scene cuts to the inside of Thomas where Mordecai and Rigby are swimming to start looking for the core.)

(Later, they both swim to the surface and breathe and get out of the stream and finally make it out to breathe and the scene shows the inside of Thomas where everything is filled with snow in a blizzard.)

Mordecai: It's freezing!

Rigby: I can't feel my fingers!

(Goat sound is heard)

Rigby: Dude, what's that!

(Goat appears)

Thomas's Consciousness (similar goat voice by speaking): Mor-de-cai. Rig-by. Mor-de- (suddenly has the voice of Thomas and head.)

(Mordecai and Rigby scream.)

Thomas's Consciousness: Whoa, whoa, guys, guys it's me Thomas.

Mordecai: No way, dude. How can you be Thomas if we're inside your...uh. His head.

Thomas's Consciousness: I'm Thomas's Consciousness. Of course I'm in my own head.

Rigby: Hmm. I guess that makes sense.

(The area rumbles and Mordecai and Rigby scream.)

Mordecai: Uhh, what was that?

Thomas's consciousness: The cool is making the brain unstable. It can't hold much longer like this.

Mordecai: Do you know where the brain core is?

Thomas's Consciousness: Yeah, it's over there. Take a look.

(He tooked out a pair of binoculars and gave it to Rigby to let him see where the brain core is.)

(Rigby sees it surrounded by an igloo, then sees a group of huskies gliding the sled while, he also sees the Cool Cubed and his translator going for the core.)

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze!

Translator: Mush! Mush!

Rigby: Dude! The Cool Cubed is almost at the core! What are we gonna do!?

Mordecai: We're gonna stop that slushy!

(All of them go in the shed where they see all the supplies they need.)

Rigby: Dr. Henry makes one heck of a house call!

Mordecai: This might be the transporter to take us back. It's too big to carry, we have to come back for it. Time to suit up.

(They put on jackets, get matches, bow and arrows and more of the supplies then, put it in the vehicle and then got in.)

Mordecai: Let's blow torch this sickle stand.

(They leave the shed then scene cuts where the Cool Cubed and his translator are still going to the core.)

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze! (notices them coming) Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!

Translator: Hmm...(still keeps on going) Hah!

Rigby: Yeah! We got him!

(They see a glacier and they try to avoid it)

(The three scream as more glaciers rise. They try to avoid the risen glaciers. Later, they are all close to each other but then Mordecai turns the switch to go farther then the Cool Cubed.)

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze! (shimmers then zaps the right caterpillar track of the snow vehicle then the other three fall off of it.)

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze! (Cool Cubed and his translator come closer to them.)

Rigby: What's your problem man!?

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!

Translator: I am the coldest slushy in the world! I have a reputation to appalled, which means no area of this brain goes unfrozen!

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze!

Translator: Now you die!

(Cool Cubed shimmers again and fires another beam.)

Thomas's consciousness: No!

(Thomas's consciousness jumps in the way of the freeze beam and gets hit. His whole body but head is covered in ice.

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze! (translation) Finish him!

Translator: Hahahahaha!

Mordecai: NO! (Mordecai moves Thomas's consciousness out of the way when the translator was about to spear him but, ended up making a crack of the ground making him fall all the way down but, the Cool Cubed still went for the core.) He's getting away!

Thomas's consciousness: Hurry. Go, go!

Mordecai: But, we can't just leave you here!

Thomas's consciousness: Just. Stop the Cool Cubed. (the ice begins to go all over his face.)

Mordecai: (to Rigby) Come on!

(They all start running along to the core.)

Cool Cubed: Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! (begins to climb on the igloo where the core is.) Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! (Mordecai and Rigby pant while they climb and when the Cool Cubed was already in the top of the igloo, he saw the core and was about to go in until Rigby pulled him in the leg.) Freeze! Freeze-

(Rigby grunts)

Mordecai: Hold him up while I find the core!

(Rigby goes on Cool Cubed) Rigby: Stay away from his brain hole (punches Cool Cubed repeatedly) you slush bag!

(When Mordecai saw the core too, he was about to put out the dynamite with the fire matches until, the Cool Cubed noticed and pushed him to make the supplies fall in without warming the core up but fell close to the core.)

Mordecai: (in pain) Ugh..

Cool Cubed: (goes in to freeze the core) FREEEZE!!

Rigby: He's gonna freeze the core!

Cool Cubed: FREEEZE!!!

(The Cool cubed is about to freeze it but, Mordecai gets ready to warm it up by getting a bow and arrow.)

Rigby: Dude! What are you doing?!

Mordecai: Doctor's orders.

(Mordecai shoots the arrow to the dynamite directly when the whole igloo starts to explode beating the Cool Cubed. When everything falls apart in the igloo, Mordecai and Rigby fall down while screaming but, when they barely fall, the watch Rigby was given starts to blink when the 5 minutes were up and then Rigby's hand starts to grow.)

Rigby: Aah! Uh, dude?

Mordecai: We gotta get to the transporter!

(Both of them start to run while their jackets start to rip apart while they were growing more and more than all the snow and blizzard was going away then all of a sudden, they both saw exactly the same spot where they first saw the transporter.)

Rigby: Find the transporter!

(As he was said, Mordecai looks quickly for the transporter on the melted water.)

Rigby: (still growing) Dude?!

(Mordecai sees the transporter and gets it.)

Mordecai: I got it! I got it!

Rigby: Press it! Press it!

(Mordecai still grows too while he attempts to press the button while them leaving back to the real world.)

Mordecai: Thomas?

(Thomas's eyes start to blink then he's finally awake with his normal face.)

Thomas: (gasp) Whoa! How did I do?! How did I do?!

Mordecai: Dude, your brain was totally frozen. You almost died!

Thomas: Whoa, Really?

Rigby: Yeah, but we were injected in your body and saved you! Check out your pho-to!

Pops: Your brain freeze photo was the best of its all Thomas!

Mordecai: Yeah it did!

(Everyone laughs while Thomas exams the photo of his brain freeze face.)

Thomas: Hahaha haha (in pain) Oh. Oww. Ow..

(End of "Cool Cubed")

(The episode opens with Mordecai and Rigby gardening in the Park)

Rigby: H-h-h...

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: (Looking at a $100 bill on the ground) H-h-hundred dollar bill... (Tries to grab it but it suddenly moves away) What the? (Starts to run after it)

Mordecai: (Driving the Golf Cart) Get in!

(Rigby gets into the Golf Cart and they drive toward the $100 bill. Rigby grabs it but it gets away again and goes behind the Country Club gates and reveals that a man, the Country Club Leader, had the $100 bill tied to a fishing hook)

Rigby: Aw man! It's those Country Club jerks!

Roger: (Laughs) They totally fell for it.

Country Club Leader: Ah, that's rich.

Male Member 2: Kinda like us! (The group laugh again)

Rigby: You think it's funny to do that to people?

Mordecai: Let's see how you like it!

(Mordecai grabs the Cart and starts to spray dirt into the Country Club with it)

Rigby: Hm, hm, hm, hm!

Female Member 1: Ah, stop! Security!

(Four men suddenly rush out, lift up the Golf Cart knocking Mordecai out of it, and they take the Cart into the Country Club)

Mordecai: Hey, what are you doing? You can't take our Golf Cart!

Female Member 2: Here in the Country Club, we can do whatever we want.

Roger: That's right babe. (Kisses her and they both drink)

Rigby: Give us back our Cart!

Country Club Leader: I'd rather not. You know why? Because, we are going to destroy it tonight at our annual Summer Solstice event! (Looks over at the Female Member 1) What do you think dear?

Female Member 1: Oh, I think it's a marvelous idea! (They kiss and drink their drinks) Now, what're you all say we leave this side-show and get some d'oeuvres ? (She and the rest of the group agree and they all leave)

Mordecai: Man, forget this, I'm going to get the Cart.

(Mordecai and Rigby climb over the gate but the alarm goes off and two security guards start charging toward them)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah! Woah! Woah! (They get tossed out)

Rigby: Man...Benson's gonna kill us when he finds out the Cart is missing!


Mordecai: He's not gonna find out.

(Clock transition to Muscle Man, High Five Ghost, Skips, Thomas, and Pops near the Snack Bar)

Mordecai: Guys, we need your help!

Pops: What's the matter?

Rigby: You guys have to promise not to tell Benson. The Golf Cart just got confiscated by the Country Club and we need your guys help to get it back. (The group just stares at them blankly and they go back to what they were doing, except Thomas) What's the matter? Didn't you guys hear us?

Muscle Man: Yeah, we heard you bro. But I'm not going anywhere near that Country Club!

Mordecai: What? Why?

Muscle Man: A couple of years ago, they confiscated a meat locker I had outside of my trailer.

High Five Ghost: They also stole my four-wheeler.

Pops: My prized orchid!

Thomas: Wait...there's a Country Club?-- 

Skips: I've had to replace thirty dream catchers 'cause of those guys. With the amount of money they have, they're unstoppable. So, stay away from 'em!

Mordecai: Come on guys, we can't do it without you!

Skips: Sorry, no can do.

Mordecai: Yeah, well, we don't have much of a choice. If we don't get the Cart back, then Benson is gonna kill us!

(The group looks on silently)

Rigby: Alright, fine! We'll go on it ourselves. But can you guys at least make sure Benson doesn't find out about the Cart before we get back?

Skips: Yeah...we can do that.

(Clock transition back to the Country Club)

Mordecai: Remember, we got blend in. (He and Rigby enter the Country Club near some men) Am I right?

Rigby: Ace!

(The three men see them and are confused but shrug it off)

(The two walk toward a building)

Mordecai: Let's start in here. 

(They enter the building and look around. A live orchestra is playing on a high row with a conductor.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah!

Country Club Members: (To one set of Country Club members) (Laughing) Cheers! (To another group of members) (laughing) Cheers!

Mordecai and Rigby: (Pretending to drink) Cheers! (The two head further out)

Rigby: This place is crazy! (He and Mordecai walk up to a lone toilet in a large room) Is this the restroom?

Mordecai: Weird...let's keep going. (He and Rigby walk past some doors into a room full of toilets) What the? (Looks around at the toilets) What's with all the toilets?

(Mordecai and Rigby notice the door handle shaking and two security guards enter the room. Mordecai and Rigby are seen hiding behind some toilets)

Security Guard 1: Did you hear something? (Points in Mordecai and Rigby's direction)

Security Guard 2: (Nods) Maybe it was your imagination.

Security Guard 1: Yah, I always make my imagination get the best of me. 

(The two Security Guards pretend to walk away and close the door. Mordecai and Rigby sign in relief but they are suddenly gagged by the two Guards. The scene changes back to the Snack Bar, where Benson is now in front of the Park Gang, trying to get information out of them, presumably on the whereabouts of Mordecai and Rigby.)

Benson: (Pacing around) Okay, I'm tired of asking questions! So, now you're going to tell me what is going on! Thomas, I know you know.

Thomas: (Confused) Huh? What?

Benson: I SUGGEST YOU SPILL IT!

Skips: Alright, everybody settle down.

Benson: Well, look who decided to chime in.

Skips: Okay, I'm gonna tell you what's going on, but you're not gonna like it.

(Camera zooms out)

Benson: WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?

(Crows fly away and the scene changes back to the Country Club with Mordecai and Rigby tied down)

Mordecai and Rigby: Huh? What?

(The scene views over to piles of burning toilets and the rest of the Country Club members. The Leader then approaches Mordecai and Rigby)

Country Club Leader: Well, well, well, everyone! Please join me in welcoming our honored guests! (He and the other members clap and cheer for them)

Mordecai: Let us go!

Rigby: Yeah, and give us our Cart back!

Country Club Leader: Oh, you'll be seeing your old Cart soon enough. But not before we make a few "improvements."

Mordecai: What do you mean "improvements"?

Country Club Leader: We'll be turning it...into a toilet! (The other members' cheer) Bring out the Toilet Making Machine!

(A large machine is suddenly brought out)

Rigby: You have a machine that turns things into toilets?

Country Club Leader: Yeah...I wouldn't expect you to understand. You're not rich!

Female Member 1: Not at all.

Country Club Member: Good one pumpkin-cheeks! (Kisses her) But if you were, you know that the only thing that matters in life is turning other people's things into toilets!

Mordecai: What? That doesn't even make any sense!

Rigby: Yeah! And you already have a ton of toilets, why do you need to turn our Golf Cart into one?

Country Club Leader: Because this is a special occasion, we're gonna shoot it into outer space. It's the "richest" way to celebrate the Summer Solstice.

(Three men are seen underwater and they activate a ramp and a rocket that points up at the sky. Mordecai and Rigby are knocked out by two of the Security Guards and their mouths are tapped up)

Roger: Hey, why don't we turn them into toilets and shoot them into space!

Country Club Leader: Excellent idea, Roger! Now, bring out the cart and start the machine! (Two Security Guards bring out the Golf Cart and places it into one part of the Toilet Making Machine. The Country Club Leader laughs evily as he turns on the machine and the Golf Cart starts to move) Yes...

(Mordecai and Rigby watch in horror as the Golf Cart is about to be turned into a toilet. The scene shifts over to two Guards near the gate)

Gate Guard: Did you get your wife anything for the Solstice? (The second Gate Guard just looks at him annoyingly and the two spot something) Stop! This is invite-only!

(The two Gate Guards jump out of the way and it turns out to be Benson, Skips, Muscle Man, High Five Ghost, Pops, and Thomas all arriving)

Country Club Leader: WHAT?!

Benson: (Gets out of the car) Why didn't you tell me the Country Club stole the Cart?! (Mordecai and Rigby, surprised to see Benson muffle their relief and Rigby saying "Sorry!") These guys have been taking our stuff LONG enough!

Muscle Man, High Five Ghost, Skips, and Pops: Yeah!

Benson: Well, not this time, not everyone can just buy another boom-box when theirs get stolen you know! Some of us have to work really hard to replace our boom-boxes! So, I think it's time we take back what's ours!

Country Club Leader: That may be a little difficult. Seeing how you're not rich! (Takes out a gun and all of the rest of the Country Club members scream and run away. He then raises the gun up high) Call in the Calvary!

(The Country Club Leader fires the gun and a bunch of jockeys on horses begin rushing toward the group. Thomas rips off the tape on Mordecai and Rigby as Muscle Man uses bolt cutters to cut away at the rope. The Jockeys begin to get closer)

Mordecai: Look out!

(Muscle Man is running away, but is caught up and knocked over by a Jockey. The Golf Cart is shown to be reaching closer to the lasers of the Toilet Making Machine)

Mordecai: Let's get the Cart! (He and Rigby run closer to the Toliet Making Machine but they are stopped by the Country Club Leader) Shouldn't have messed with us man! (Punches the Country Club Leader but it doesn't seem to affect him)

Rigby: Let me handle this, in your face! (Punches the Country Club Leader but it still doesn't affect him)

Country Club Leader: (Laughs) I had sixty-seven facelifts. I can't feel a thing! (Grabs Mordecai and Rigby by their faces) And I had tiger tendents implanted in my hands, so I can mess with whoever I please! (Throws them down)

(Camera shifts over to Benson and the others fighting the Jockeys)

Benson: (Grabs one of the Jockey's sticks) Hey, watch it! He's just an intern!

Jockey: Intern THIS buddy! (Kicks Benson in the face)

(Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are overpowered by the Jockeys and Pops is seen running from one. Skips comes out of nowhere and punches the Jockey in the face, runs over to a water pipe and begins to spray away some Jockeys into the nearby lake. The Submarine Divers emerge from the lake)

Submarine Diver: Disable the water cannon.

(Some Submarine Divers are sprayed away by Skips but some of them manage to tackle him down. Benson is punched down by a Jockey but manages to punch him back. Pops is seen fist-fighting a man, both shirtless, while Muscle Man and Thomas are suddenly attacked by tennis balls)

Muscle Man: Where's it coming from? (Notices a tennis player high on the roof firing tennis balls at them) We gotta take control of the tower!

(Muscle Man runs forward and blocks an incoming tennis ball. The tennis ball heads through the Toilet Making Machine's lasers and is turned into a mini toilet. Mordecai and Rigby are seen still fighting the Country Club Leader and Rigby climbs into the machine grabbing onto the Golf Cart)

Country Club Leader: You're ruining the Solstice! (Not affected by Mordecai's punches) The Cart will go through! (Tosses Rigby backwards but Mordecai grabs onto the cart) STOP! STOP IT! (Tosses Mordecai down)

(Muscle Man, High Five Ghost, and Thomas are seen heading toward the house with the tennis player shooting tennis balls is on. They start climbing up but the tennis player attempts to shoot tennis balls at them)

Muscle Man: Thomas, don't let the balls hit you! (Thomas is hit by a tennis ball and lands hard on the ground)' THOMAS!

(The camera views over to Pops being overpowered by the man and Benson still wrestling with the Jockey. Skips is trying to fight away the Submarine Divers and the Golf Cart is shown to inch closer to the lasers. Mordecai and Rigby kick the Country Club Leader down and they start to push the Cart back in the opposite direction. The Country Club Leader then takes them down and Mordecai spots a nearby walkie-talkie and presses it with his hand)

Mordecai: Muscle Man, you gotta stall the machine!

Muscle Man: I'm on it! (Takes off his shirt and tosses it at the tennis player)

Tennis Player: Argh, it smells like barf! (Falls off the roof screaming)

High Five Ghost: There, shoot it!

(Muscle Man fires a tennis ball at one of the Submarine Diver's oxygen tanks which causes him to fly around and hit the satellite of the Toilet Making Machine. The Golf Cart stops in its tracks)

Mordecai and Rigby: NOW! (They move out of the way)

Country Club Leader: Hey! (The Golf Cart lands on him)

Muscle Man: Yes!

(Mordecai and Rigby begin to drive the Cart out of the machine)

Country Club Leader: No, you can't stop the machine! Do you have any idea how much this thing costs?! (Charges toward them. Mordecai and Rigby look up to see the man fall off the machine, which activates it again.)

Mordecai: Well then I hope you get your money's worth. (Drives the Cart forward which causes the Country Club Leader to go through the lasers and he is turned into a toilet)

Country Club Leader: No! (Lands into the rocket and is blasted off into space as the Park Gang and Country Club members look on. The scene changes to outer space, where the rocket opens up and sends the Country Club Leader out.) NO! NO! NOOOOOO!!!

(Scene changes over back to the Country Club with a bunch of the members being arrested. The park members recover their toilet-transformed stuff. Pops is also seen putting a toilet-like object on the car, his prized orchid that he had mentioned earlier.)

High Five Ghost: I wonder if I can still ride this four-wheeler?

Muscle Man: I don't know, but I'm definitely gonna keep using this meat locker. (opens the meat locker of his toilet. The camera shifts over to Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, and Skips)

Mordecai: Thanks again for coming back and helping us guys.

Benson: (Holding his boom-box toilet) Well, you know I'm proud of you two. You had the guts to stand up to these people and take back what's ours.

Skips: (Holding a dreamcatcher toilet) Yeah, seriously. Now I can finally catch up on my dream-catchin'.

Rigby: (He and Mordecai look up at the sky) So, you think that guy will be able to survive up in space?

Mordecai: Probably, he's rich! (He and Rigby laugh, then sigh, as the Country Club Leader, still in toilet form, is seen drifting through space)

(End of "Country Club")

(Episode starts in Eileen's house, where Mordecai, Rigby and Margaret are watching a TV show.)

Man on TV: And now, commentary from RGB2!

RGB2: If you ask this old-timer, TV peaked in the 80s! Why don't shows have laugh tracks anymore?

(Eileen pokes her head out from the kitchen.)

Eileen: Sorry to keep you guys waiting. I know you're hungry but my famous peanut butter and celery appetizers will be out in a jiffy.

(The TV switches to an advertisement for Seeds of Agony by Jonno.)

Jonno: Audacieusement modern, contrasté, avant- ...  garde. These are all words you might say when you gaze upon my piece, Seeds of Agony. (Zooms out to show a giant strawberry behind her.) You won't want to miss this cultural event before it is taken by blimp back to my minimalist region studio and destroyed. The venue? (Laughs.) A transitional local between the realms of light and dreams.

(TV shows a map which displays where Seeds of Agony is.)

TV voiceover: Off of Spruce and I 95 at dusk by the Cheezer's. Saturday only!

Jonno voiceover: Whimsical!

(Shows the three on the couch.)

Mordecai: Wow, that sounds crazy.

Rigby: (Laughs mischievously.) Crazy enough to work!

Mordecai: Dude, what are you talking about?

(Rigby leans over to whisper to them.)

Rigby: Can you guys keep a secret? (Checks to see if anyone is watching.) I'm taking Eileen to see that tomorrow! And you guys are coming with! And, you're not gonna ruin the surprise!

Mordecai: What? 

Margaret: It sounds a little intense.

Mordecai: And why's it gotta be a surprise? Is it a special occasion or something?

Rigby: No, and that's the point! She'd be expecting something if it was. I've made her laugh, cry, scream with terror when she fell into that cave hole; all the big emotions. But she's too smart to be surprised! 

Mordecai: No way. 

Rigby: If there's a mystery, she has to solve it. Whenever I try to surprise Eileen, she figures it out immediately.

(Shows a flashback scene of Rigby dressed in murder-mystery-style clothing.)

Rigby: Good evening, my lady. I'm here to warn you that trouble's afoot. You see, there's been a mur-  

Eileen: (Squeals) You're taking me to a murder mystery, right? 

Rigby: Uh... yes.

Eileen: Great! I already picked out a dress so we could go! 

(Shows another flashback scene. Rigby is holding a telescope and not wearing any special clothes.)

Rigby: Surprise! I'm taking you-

Eileen: To the conjunction of the Moon and Mars up on Lookout Mountain? I know! I'm so excited!

(Shows another scene where Rigby is simply at Eileen's house without any items or clothes.)

Rigby: Hello-

Eileen: You're taking me to the biannual mating season of the Hermit Crabs? You're the best!

(Cuts back to the house.)

Rigby: She's smart like that, dude. So I thought of a plan so crazy she'll never figure it out. Will you guys help drive us around?

Mordecai: Dude, you're being kinda crazy, but at least it's a nice kind of crazy.

Margaret: I think that's sweet Rigby. Of course we'll help you.

(Eileen walks into the room carrying a tray of celery and peanut butter.)

Eileen: Who wants celery and peanut butter? Wait, I smell a surprise brewing.

Rigby: No. You don't

Eileen: You're taking me to a movie after this. 

(Rigby jumps off the couch.)

Rigby: Ha, noooo! 

(Walks up with his face close to Eileen's head.)

Rigby: Is there even a surprise at all? Who's to say?

(He walks away. Eileen thinks. Margaret and Mordecai pretend to not know.)

(Transitions to the coffee shop. Eileen is working when Rigby walks in. He is wearing beach shorts, a formal jacket, and a hat. He is holding a flower.)

Eileen: I'm gonna say, based on your beach-casual look, combined with formal jacket and corsage, we're going to... Beach Prom! That's the most fun party of the year! 

Rigby: Oh, Eileen, Eileen, Eileen, Eileen. I have a different surprise in store for you. And this time, you're never gonna be able to guess it! Now ditch the apron, we're heading out.

Eileen: Wait, but I still have to work.

Rigby: Talked to your boss, it's taken care of.

(They look over to where a random guy is.)

Random guy: Hey, fifty years from now, are you gonna remember bussing tables, or the greatest adventure of your life? Now get out of here you crazy kids.

Eileen: Rigby, I don't know who that is.

Rigby: He's a guy who gets it.  But don't worry, I did talk to your boss.

(They walk out together.)

Eileen: Hmmm, if it's not Beach Prom, are we going to Costa Rica? 

Rigby: No need to guess, just enjoy the surprise.

Eileen: Maybe your outfit is a red herring.

(They walk over to where Margaret and Mordecai are waiting for them next to Margaret's car. They pretend to be randomly running into them.)

Margaret: Woah... Craaaazy running into you guys. Soooo random.

Mordecai: Need a lift?

Eileen: (Thinking) But that could also be a red herring of said red herring, meaning... (Puts on a jacket from inside the car.) Beach Prom!

Rigby: JUST GET IN THE CAR!

(Transition to the four driving.)

Eileen: I'd say we're about fifteen miles outside of downtown heading northwest. The temperature has dropped approximately three degrees, which puts us near that shoe store I like, but... (Calculates on her fingers.) Yup, we'd overshoot it by about nine-hundred feet. (Notices Sea Turtle Fan Club at the Super Hotel 25.) Ah! Sea Turtle Fan Club! I just paid my dues! That's so nice, Rigby! 

(Rigby's watch beeps.)

Rigby: And... time to turn around. (He puts on a doctor's shirt and hat, as well as a stethoscope.) 

Margaret: Huh?

Rigby: Uh, make a u-turn up here!

Margaret: Okay.

(They turn around and eventually get to the Park.)

Rigby: Alright, everyone get out and go behind the house.

(They walk behind the house, where there is rope, three chairs, a cardboard box, tiki torches and a parachute. Eileen thinks. The scene shows a first-person view of Eileen's brain, which looks like a futuristic computer. She combines the items to show a hot air balloon.)

Eileen: I've got it! You're building a hot air balloon with all this stuff for us to ride in!

(?)

Muscle Man: That stuff's for a birthday at the park later, which you guys better be back for.

Rigby: Speaking of which, round 'em up! Back in the car!

(?)

Muscle Man: Not cool, bros!

(?)

Eileen: Rigby, I have to say this is the best surprise you've ever done. (?) But that doesn't mean I won't figure out what it is.

BIKER: You gonna tell us now?

Rigby: No!

BIKER: All right! Ladies first!

BIKER: Aah!

Rigby: All right! You win!

Eileen:

(?)

(The episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby watching a movie at the coffee shop)

TV Announcer: Now, back to Crime Scene Detective Cops 2.

(guys on the TV drive up to some ladies)

Cop 1: (sounds like Mordecai) Hey, ladies. Did you happen to catch our license plate? It's missing some numbers.

Cop 2: (sounds like Rigby) Your numbers. How 'bout it, ladies?

(the girls chuckle)

Blonde Girl: (takes out sheet) Here!

Cop 1: And that's how you get a chick's number.

Cop 2: Aw, yeah! Cruisin'!

(everyone in the movie laughs, then, freezeframes to show the caption "end." Margaret and Eileen aren't impressed)

Margaret and Eileen: What?

Rigby: Whoa. That was awesome!

Margaret: I can't believe you think that's cool.

Eileen: Yeah. That movie was chauvinistic, and also, inaccurate.

Mordecai: I don't know. I heard that movie was based on a true story.

Rigby: If this movie has taught us anything, and it definitely has, you only need one thing to get a girl's number. (sign-languages driving) A sweet ride.

Eileen: I mean, Not necessarily. You could just, you know, ask a girl for it, Rigby.

Rigby: (startles Eileen) Eileen, don't be so naive, that would never work.

Mordecai: Rigby's right. It's a known fact that wheels make you more attractive.

Rigby: A known fact! I don't know how many times I've almost gotten a girl's number, then some guy in a muscle car would swing in and totally ruin my game.

(Margaret and Eileen laugh)

Margaret: Oh, guys. You're kidding, right?

Mordecai: Are you saying you wouldn't give us your number if we pulled up in some cool wheels?

Margaret: You dorks would never be able to get a girl's number cruising.

Mordecai: Oh yeah?

Margaret: (Puts hands on the table and stares into Mordecai's eyes): Yeah.

Rigby: (hops up to table): Let's bet on it!

Margaret: Okay. How about dinner? If you guys get a girl's number from cruising by the end of the day-

Eileen: -which you won't-

Margaret: -we'll pay for it. But if you don't,-

Eileen: -hope you can afford Lobster and Filet Mignon, guys.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. We accept your challenge.

Rigby: I hope you guys can afford Unlimited Corn-Dog bar.

Margaret: Well gentlemen, good luck.

(Margaret and Eileen chuckle and walk away)

Mordecai: Whoa, did you just see that? They were totally flirting with us.

Rigby: Flirt? Is that wha-? Wait a mi... nah.

Mordecai: Dude, they know were gonna win. They're just playing hard to get.

Rigby: But aren't we cruising for two different girls numbers?

Mordecai: Well, yeah, but that's just for show.

Rigby: I thought women were supposed to be directive about what they want.

Mordecai: Ha ha. You'll learn someday dude.

Rigby: Whatever man, I'm just in it for the free meal.

(Cuts to the next scene where a lot of men cruising for women to get their numbers; then Mordecai and Rigby come to the scene with the golf cart)

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Get some digits, get some dinner. (Mordecai and Rigby chuckle)

(Margaret and Eileen come to scene)

Margaret: Oh, look who it is.

Mordecai: Ladies.

Eileen: Since we get to choose where to go to dinner if we win, how does Il Costosos sound?

Rigby: Uh, isn't that the pricey place with napkins?

Eileen: The really fancy ones, yes.

Mordecai: Sure. Il Costosos.

Rigby: Yeah, sounds good.

Margaret: Perfect. Oh, and can we bring our dates too?

Mordecai: Dates?

Margaret: Yeah, loser buy dinner for the winners, and their dates. That cool?

Mordecai: Yeah. Totally. Totally cool.

Margaret: Awesome. Well, see you guys.

Rigby: Dude, we can't afford that!

Mordecai: Dude, we got to win this bet. I don't want to be the third wheel to Margaret and her date.

Rigby: Well then let's get these wheels going, and gets chick's numbers a flowing! (Turns on the music)

(Mordecai and Rigby find three chicks and impress them with their "Sweet" ride, but they laugh and walk away. They find another chick who has a piece of paper and a pencil, and writes her number to them, but it was actually for an another guy on his ride. They find another chick and Mordecai and Rigby try to impress her, but she runs away, jumps on a car, and hangs on to a helicopter and flies away.)

Mordecai: Aw, what? Dude this isn't working.

Rigby: Yeah, the movie made it look so easy.

(They see two girls getting a ride with two other dudes)

Scabitha: Whoooo hooo!

Trash: Nice cart, losers.

Scabitha: Yeah. Good luck getting numbers driving around in that.

Mordecai: We gotta get a better ride.

(Skips to the park, where Pops is washing his car.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hey, Pops.

Pops: Why, hello gentlemen. What brings you here?

Mordecai: Can we borrow your car, Pops?

Pops: Why whatever for?

Rigby: We need it to win a bet.

Pops: (Laughs) Oh, a wager! I simply adore a good wager. And so does Carmenita.

Rigby: Wha-?

Pops: That's her name.

Mordecai: Awesome.

Rigby: Thanks, Pops. (Mordecai and Rigby now jump into the car.)

Mordecai: Aw, cool.

Rigby: So cool.

Pops: Now, Mordecai, you do know how to drive stick right?

Mordecai: Of course. Uh...

Rigby: What are these gears?

Pops: Those are Carmenita's special gears. I advise you not to touch them. Carmenita's special parts should only be manipulated by a professional.

Mordecai: Don't worry, Pops. We'll just win the bet, and we'll be right back. See ya. (Drive off)

Pops: Bye!

(Skips to next to scene back to the Two Peaks mall parking lot.)

Rigby: Yo, Margaret and Eileen, feast your eyes on our sweet ride. Prepare to taste defeat, ladies.

Margaret: You know what I'm prepare to taste? (The girls get a menu of Il Costosos)

Eileen: Baltic sea scallops with red wine reduction, $35.

Margaret: Oh... Or Coby braised short ribs on a gold leaf. $41.

Mordecai: You fill up on bread!

Margaret: Oh, you mean the rustic artisan cheese bread imported from France? That's $15.

(Mordecai and Rigby get frustrated; then two guys show up.)

Chad Ironchest: Hey! These guys bothering you Margaret?

Tuck Packerd: How 'bout you Eileen?

Margaret: Oh, no, no, no, no. Mordecai, Chad "Ironchest."

Eileen: Rigby, Tuck Packerd.

Chad: Mordecai & Rigby? These are the guys? I just want to thank you, bros. I mean paying for a four star meal for the four of us? Guys, seriously.

Mordecai: Agh! (drive off) Must...get...girls...numbers! (Spot girls) Uh... hi. We lost our numbers.

Rigby: Cancan we have yours?

Girl #1: You got to be kidding me.

Mordecai and Rigby: Agh! (Spot another girl)

Mordecai: Uh, so ladies, do you--? I mean, are you angels cause-- (The girls leave)

Mordecai and Rigby: Agh! (Spot another girl)

Rigby: We really need to win a bet, and-- (The girl laughs and walks away)

Mordecai & Rigby: Agh!

(Goes to the next scene)

Mordecai: This is bad dude. Just think. What else besides a cool car do those dudes in the movie have? I got it! Self-confidence! I mean, look at your face.

Rigby: (Depressed look) What's wrong with my face?

Mordecai: Your face is desperate, dude. Follow my lead. (Puts on a confident look)

Rigby: Whoa. (Puts on a confident look as well) (Long pause) Dude, this isn't gonna work. No human ever makes this face.

(The two girls a few scenes ago come in and gets in Mordecai and Rigby's car.)

Trash: Hey, what's up?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uh, hey.

Trash: We were just walking by, and couldn't help but notice how confident you guys looked.

Scabitha: Yeah, could you give us a ride?

Mordecai: Uh, sure.

(We see another car with the two dudes that were with the girls a few scenes ago and they look frustrated)

Rigby: I'm Rigby, and this is Mordecai. What are your names?

Trash: My name's Trash.

Scabitha: Scabitha.

Rigby: Oh, ha, ha. Those are pretty names. (Whispers to Mordecai) These girls are making me feel uncomfortable.

Mordecai: (Whispers to Rigby) We just need their numbers, man. Seal the deal.

Rigby: Uh... so, how do you guys feel about phones?

Trash: Are they following us yet? (Looking in the rearview mirror in the car that follows)

Scabitha: Right on time.

Trash: Slow down the car.

Mordecai: Huh, why?

Trash: Just do it! (Mordecai and Rigby slow down Carmenita, and while Carmenita slows down, Trash & Scabitha look at the car that's following them and start cheering.)

Bloodshed: Trash, Scabitha, what are you think you're doing?

Trash and Scabitha: Get lost, dweebs!

Scabitha: Yeah! We're having fun with our new boyfriends now.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Manslaughter: Hey, Bloodshed. I think these guys are looking for trouble.

Bloodshed: I think so too, Manslaughter.

Rigby: Bloodshed? Manslaughter?! 

Mordecai: No, no, no! We're not looking for trouble! We don't even want your girlfriends!

Rigby: Yeah, we just want their numbers!

Bloodshed: YOU GUYS ARE DEAD! (Accelerates and collides several times to Carmenita)

Rigby: Speed up! SPEED UP!!

Mordecai: Dude, I can't! This is as fast as it goes!

Rigby: Maybe one of these speeds it up. (Mordecai hits him hand)

Mordecai: No, dude! Pops said not to touch them! (The car collides back again)

Rigby: I'm going for it! (Rigby pulls one of the levers for Carmenita's special gears, and just like that, Carmenita starts flying to the sky. Mordecai starts to get scared, but then notices that Carmenita is flying in the air.)

Bloodshed: Two can play at this game! (Activates a flammable device to his car, causing it to fly too. They approach Carmenita, and collide by their side.)

Trash: (Honk) You jealous boys?!

Bloodshed: Spine-rippingly jealous!

Manslaughter: (While simulates a strangulation and a blow) Throat-chokingly, heart-punchingly jealous!

Rigby: I just wanted a free meal!

(While in the parking lot, Margaret and Eileen are sitting and taking a drink...)

Eileen: You don't think Rigby really thinks I'm dating Tuck Packerd, do you?

Margaret: So what if he does? A little jealousy never hurt anyone.

Eileen: (Laughs) Do you think it made Rigby jealous?

Margaret: I hope so. (pointing to the sky) Check it out, it's a plane.

Rigby: Oh no-ha-ha!

Trash: I'm glad, you guys are jealous.

Scabitha: Cause we got something to tell you ge-

Trash and Scabitha: What the? (The two cars get to the point of impact with the plane, and they are frightened and sidestep to it, one on each side) AAAAH!

Scabitha: AAAAH! Get those down from here! (Touch change Greek letters)

Mordecai: NO! Don't touch that! (The first touch opens the rear trunk. The second opens the front which makes the engine has difficulty. Mordecai coughs) Stop her!

Rigby: Hey! Stop messing with those! (Rigby starts fighting Scabitha, but she grabs him and beats him)

Manslaughter: Oh, you're asking for it!

Scabitha: (Rigby tries to get out of his arms, but then she pushes him.) Thanks for abdiction! You, boonies!

Trash: These scrubs aren't our boyfriends, we just wanted to make you appreciate us more.

Scabitha: Can you kill these guys so we can go home?

Manslaughter: Babes, really? That's so touching. (Expression of anger) Give us back our girlfriends! 

(Bones bankruptcy leads down Carmenita and hits her 4 times. In the fourth, the engine shoots out toward the ground; and then it explodes.)

Rigby: Uhh, Mordecai? What was that?

Mordecai: That was the engine, dude.

Trash and Scabitha: THE ENGINE?! (The car falls)

Manslaughter: The babes! (Trash and Scabitha start to be scared but then start to hit Mordecai and Rigby until they get back in Bloodshed's & Manslaughter's car and fly away.)

Rigby: DUDE, DO SOMETHING! (Mordecai activates another function of the change, which takes strange wings which lift them before they hit the ground Mordecai and Rigby collide five, but then they hit a tree and fall off the car injured)

Margaret: Are you okay? (She and Eileen run to where they are)

Mordecai: You guys were right. Cruising is the worst way to pick up women.

Eileen: Oh, you poor things.

Mordecai: Uhhh, we'll buy dinner for you and those guys, but... can we get your numbers so we can reschedule for tomorrow night? I'm pretty sure we need to go to the hospital.

Margaret: (While record the number) Umm, yeah, of course, no rush. I mean, we just wanna make sure that you're okay. (It gives the number Mordecai)

Mordecai: Course.

Rigby: (gasp) We got a girl's number!

Margaret: What? No!

Mordecai: Dude, we did! 

Mordecai and Rigby: Free dinner!

Margaret: Oh, what? You tricked us!

Mordecai: Hey, but you never said we couldn't get your numbers.

Eileen: At least let us choose where to eat.

Mordecai: Okay, where?

Margaret: Best sandwiches in town.

(Mordecai agrees Margaret and shakes hands with her.)

(At Coffee Shop)

Margaret: (Giving their sandwiches) Here you go, guys.

Mordecai: Uhh, aren't you gonna eat something?

Margaret: No thanks, we're good.

Eileen: Yeah, we eat those sandwiches all the time.

Rigby: Good thing these are free, cause we gotta save up to pay for the damages for Pop's car.

Mordecai: Yeah. Lesson learned, no more cruising.

TV: And now back to "Digit Jockey's" fighter pilots with the best game in town. (TV Cafeteria shown)

(A jet landing with two adults shown.)

Young Pilot: Hey, ladies. (Showing two executive Young launches a missile that says "party" to them, that the impact shows several girls in bikini on a beach) Wanna hit the pool?

(Margaret and Eileen is upset, but Mordecai and Rigby impressed. Then they see the girls.)

Margaret: Don't even think about it.

(End)


(Episode begins at Pops' house with the Park staff sitting on the stairs)

Benson: Alright. Mordecai and Rigby, rake the leaves. Muscle Man, the man with the muscle. I've got the usual for you. (inhales deeply)

(Scene cuts to Muscle Man taking out the garbage)

Benson:  (continued; voice-over) First, I need you to take out the garbage in the entire park.

(The scene then cuts to Muscle Man repaving the sidewalk)

Benson:  (continued; voice-over) Next, I need you to repave the sidewalk. Make sure not to get any cement on you. I hear it's impossible to get off.

(Muscle Man runs into a rake and falls on the cement of the paved sidewalk, then we cut to him plowing the field)

Benson:  (continued; voice-over) Next, I want you to plow the field, 'cause you're gonna install the new sprinkler system. (Then we show Muscle Man riding a trencher to dig a line in the dirt) I rented you a trencher. It should be easy to use. (We then show Muscle Man with steel pipes) Connect all the galvanized steel pipes. They should be pretty light for you. (Then we show him putting the pipes on the line and burying the pipes) Put them in a place, bury them, and that should be it... for the first half of the day, that is.

(The sprinkler system goes off and Muscle Man slips and falls in the mud as it fills the screen and it cuts to the Park staff at the house the next day. Mordecai and Rigby touch their arms.)

Mordecai:  (groans) So much raking.

Rigby:  Yeah, two whole bags of leaves. I can't even feel my arms.

(Muscle Man groans)

Benson:  (comes in) Alright, guys, another busy day ahead of us. Muscle Man, you know that sprinkler system you installed?

(Muscle Man gasps)

Benson:  It works great.

(Muscle Man sighs)

Benson:  In fact, I need you to install three more. That should be easy for you, right, big guy?

Muscle Man:  Augh! It's not fair! Why do I always get stuck with the hard jobs?

Benson:  Well, you are the strong one, I mean, you are called "Muscle Man".

Muscle Man:  Is that all I am to you, just a Muscle Man? Why doesn't Skips do the hard jobs? He's strong.

Benson:  Sure he is, but he's also smart. (to Skips) By the way, Skips, I need you to help me with my taxes today.

Muscle Man:  Oh, so he gets a cushy desk job while I get stuck with manual labor?

Skips:  Hey, I'm good with numbers.

Muscle Man:  Well, guess what? I'm sick of this job, and I'm sick of everyone just using me for my body. I'm gonna prove to you all that I'm just as smart as I am strong. I'm gonna leave the park and get an office job!

Mordecai:  Why would you do that?

Rigby:  Yeah, working at an office doesn't prove that you're smart.

Muscle Man:  It will prove it, I'll prove it right now! (takes off his headband and leaves) Muscle Man out!

Hi Five Ghost:  Muscle Man, no! I think you're strong and smart! Don't leave!

Rigby:  I give him three days.

Skips:  I give him, (counts his fingers) let's see, carry the nine... 2.57.

(Scene cuts to a building called "Omnitech Inc." and Muscle Man, wearing a tie, is at the front desk)

Receptionist:  Can I help you?

Muscle Man:  I heard you guys had some jobs.

Receptionist:  (scoffs) Not for you. (struggling a jar of pickles)

Muscle Man:  Let me get that for you.  (Takes the pickle jar and opens the lid) Here you go.

Receptionist:  Whoa! I've been trying to open that all morning. (eats a pickle) Maybe we do have a job for you. Follow me.

(Muscle Man gasps happily)

Receptionist:  (as he is walking through the offices with Muscle Man) Here at Omnitech, we provide our clients with business intelligence and smart-e solutions.

Muscle Man:  Yeah, intelligent and smart, that's me.

Receptionist:  Ha ha! Good. We're only as our employees. Omnitech: Powered by People. You'll be in Ron's old office.

Muscle Man:  Where's Ron?

Receptionist:  He got promoted to corporate. I'll leave you to it.

(Muscle Man looks at Ron's old office, much to his happiness, and he places a "Champions Never Quit" poster and a picture of Hi Five Ghost and his wedding picture with Starla, sits on his chair, getting relaxed.)

Muscle Man:  Aw, yeah! This'll prove that I'm smart. (Camera zooms out to view the offices, then we show a clock at says "11:59 AM", piles of paper and Muscle Man pulling a card with string as he gets bored) (groans) Boring. (hears laughter and checks out the office next door to find a trio of guys called the Cube Bros having a conversation)

Andy:  So I told her, "Hey, if you wanna scan my server, you gotta ask me out on a data first."

(Randy and Gil laugh)

Muscle Man:  (laughs) That was a really funny joke. I totally got that. You know who else scans her server? My mom! (The guys look at him blankly and Andy sips his coffee) Hi, I'm Muscle Man, by the way.

Randy:  Randy.

Andy:  Andy.

Gil:  Gil.

Randy:  We're the Cube Bros. We're not your typical office drones.

Cube Bros: Woaaaah...kay!

Muscle Man:  Well, I guess I'm replacing Ron.

Andy:  Oh, wait, are you the guy who opened the pickle jar?

Muscle Man:  Yeah!

Andy:  Pssh. It'll take a lot more than that to replace Ron.

Randy:  Any sack of meat can open a pickle jar.

Gil:  Yeah, a pickle jar is not that hard to open.

Muscle Man:  Look, It's not just 'cause I opened that jar, I'm smart, too, okay?

(The Cube Bros check their pagers)

Andy:  Oh, look, 12:00. Time for our corporately mandated lunch.

Muscle Man:  Hey, mind if I come?

Randy:  Oh, sorry, rookie, Cube Bros only. (They leave)

Muscle Man:  I'll show you.

(Montage begins with Muscle Man reading "Data Ethics: Volume 6" as time goes by, then at night, Muscle Man continues reading as a janitor mops by, then it changes to the next day as the montage ends)

Randy:  Hey, Mitch, did you get that TH-29 form to legal yet?

Muscle Man:  (Now in office casual turns to Randy) Actually, it's Mitchell, and nice try, but that's a trick question. The TH-29 would never go to legal, because that is, in fact, illegal.

Randy:  Whoa, good catch. Looks like someone's been studying up on "Data Ethics, Volume 6".

Muscle Man:  Volume 6? (carries two stacks of books) I read the whole series. It actually wasn't that hard.

Randy:  Whoa, those books are massive!

Gil:  (comes in and gasps) How are you holding all of those?!

Andy:  (comes in) Do you lift?

Muscle Man:  Well, I use to back at my old job, (puts down the books) but those days are over. Now, I'm more interested into breaking a mental sweat.

Randy:  Well, sure, but you're like, really strong.

Muscle Man:  And smart.

Randy:  Oh, yeah, sure. Sure, now that you've read all those books, you're up to protocol.

Muscle Man:  You know who else is up to protocol? My mo...nitor!

(The Cube Bros laugh. Montage beings with Muscle Man continuing to work in office while at the Park, Mordecai, Rigby and Fives are installing another sprinkler system, then we show Muscle Man at a meeting at Omnitech as he helps the receptionist open a bag of chips and Gil with a 5-gallon bottle of water as Randy switches Ron's old name plate to Muscle Man's name by the name of "Mitchell" as the montage ends)

Muscle Man and Cube Bros:  Cube Bros for life!

(We cut back to Mordecai, Rigby and Fives on the stairs)

Benson:  Come on, guys, those cinderblocks aren't gonna move themselves. (leaves)

Mordecai, Rigby and Hi Five Ghost:  Augh!

Mordecai:  Dude, I miss the days when we didn't have to move cinderblocks.

Rigby:  I miss the days when we didn't have to do Muscle Man's work.

Hi Five Ghost:  And I miss the way Muscle Man would make me smile with his cool sense of humor after a long day of work.

Mordecai:  Dude, we gotta go beg him to come back.

(Cut to Omnitech where Muscle Man types on his computer as the receptionist comes in)

Receptionist:  Uh, Mitchell, you have visitors. (leaves as Mordecai, Rigby and Fives enter)

Mordecai:  Hey, Muscle Ma--

Muscle Man:  Uh-uh, one more second... (finishes typing on his computer as he finished sending a memo)

Computer Voice:  Memo sent.

Muscle Man:  (turns to the guys) What are you guys doing here?

Mordecai:  Dude, Muscle Man, you gotta come back! (Rigby nods)

Hi Five Ghost:  We really need you back!

Andy:  Who are these guys, Mitchell?

(The Cube Bros look sternly at Mordecai, Rigby and Fives)

Muscle Man:  Randy, Andy, Gil, meet my old co-workers, Mordecai, Rigby and Fives. Park Bros, Cube Bros.

Randy:  Park Bros? More like College Dropout Bros, am I right?

(The Cube Bros laughs and Muscle Man laughs along nervously)

Muscle Man:  But seriously, guys, that's a little harsh.

Andy:  Well, Mitchell, we came to announce the good news.

Randy:  As of today, you're officially being promoted to corporate.

Muscle Man:  Whoa, really?

Randy:  Well, we think you're ready.

Gil:  Yeah! You were, like, born for this job.

Muscle Man:  WHOOOOO!!!!

Mordecai:  I don't know, Muscle Man. Do you really want to be stuck in a box all day? This isn't you!

Rigby:  Yeah, forget this place and come back to the Park already!

Muscle Man:  And lift heavy pipes for the rest of my life? Forget that! For once, I've found a place that appreciates me for more than just my body. I thought you guys would be happy for me.

Hi Five Ghost:  But Muscle Man, we miss you! I miss you! Please come back!

Gil:  He's made his decision!

Hi Five Ghost:  Well, congrats on becoming corporate. We'll leave you to your new friends then. (leaves with Mordecai and Rigby)

Randy:  Well, now that you've ditched those losers, we gotta show you to your new office.

(Cut to a huge picture of Ron)

Muscle Man:  Whoa! That's Ron? This dude definitely didn't skip leg day.

(One of the Cube Bros slides his card that opens the picture entrance door to reveal a giant hamster wheel and Ron's corpse)

Muscle Man:  RON! What is this?!

Randy:  The giant hamster wheel generator that powers Omnitech.

Andy:  Our office drone bodies are weak. Your brutish strength will keep the wheel moving to run Omnitech's power generator.

Muscle Man:  So, you just wanted me for my body all along?

Randy:  Yeah, Mitch.

(The Cube Bros laugh)

Gil:  Oh, yeah. Now, get on the wheel and start ru-u-u-u-u-u-u-nning!

Randy:  Yeah, or else we won't work-work-work-work-work!

Muscle Man:  What's the deal, guys? You sound like... (Randy's face blows up to reveal his robotic face) ROBOTS!!! (The Cube Bros start to struggle to push Muscle Man into the generator room) Park Bros, help!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Fives are at the elevator when they hear Muscle Man's cry for help)

Rigby:  Muscle Man!

Hi Five Ghost:  We gotta save him!

(The elevator doors open to reveal the receptionist in his robotic state and grabs the guys)

Receptionist:  Time to sign out! Office drones, attack!

(The Omnitech workers turn into their robotic states and start coming towards the guys.)

Office Drones:  Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

(The guys are released from the receptionist's grasp and run as Mordecai grabs a five-gallon bottle of water, puts it on a wheeling chair, which Rigby grabs, and they roll the chair with the five-gallon bottle of water towards the robots, which hit them and they get electrocuted and die. Mordecai, Rigby and Fives run over the office drones and continue running to save Muscle Man)

Cube Bros:  Omnitech: Powered by People!

(They shove Muscle Man in the generator room and Randy closes the entrance door as Muscle Man falls on the wheel and lands on Ron's skeleton and he starts squealing for help. A stapler is thrown at Randy and he turns to the guys)

Mordecai:  Give us back our friend!

Randy:  No! We need him for his body-y-y-y-y-y-y! (The Cube Bros charge towards the guys)

(The guys charge towards the Cube Bros and start to fight. Mordecai kicks Randy to a printer, which scans his face and prints it. Muscle Man pounds at the entrance door, then looks around to see a mainframe computer)

Muscle Man:  The mainframe! I'm gonna have to use my smarts to hack into it. (runs to the computer and starts to hack) I've got this.

Rigby:  (as he fights Andy) Hamboning!

Andy:  What's hamboning?!

(Rigby pushes Andy to the ground and elbows him, causing him to explode. Cut back to Muscle Man as he continues hacking)

Muscle Man:  Almost got it... (presses a key on the keyboard) Hah! (Shows a solitaire game) What?

Gil:  (as he is holding Fives while the entrance door opens) Congrats on "hacking" computer solitaire, genius! Get back on that hamster wheel and run, you sack of meat! You'll never be smart!

Muscle Man:  (rips his office shirt) Smart this! (grabs the mainframe computer and runs towards Gil)

Gil:  Oh, no! Can't run fast enough with my weak robot legs!

(Muscle Man throws the mainframe computer at Gil as it lands on him, causing his head to pop off and fly into Fives' arms, which he drops it and Gil starts laughing evilly as the computer mainframe shows a self-destruct countdown and the building begins to shake)

Mordecai:  This place is gonna blow!

(As Gil continues laughing evilly, the guys make a run for it and jump out through the window as the building explodes into a pile of rubble)

Muscle Man:  Whoa, corporate carnage. Thanks for helping me out, you guys.  That escalated really quickly.

Rigby:  Yeah, you really dodged a bullet on that one.

Muscle Man:  I still wish I could prove that I'm more than just a Muscle Man. Maybe I'm not as smart as I thought.

Hi Five Ghost:  Oh, you're smart, just a different kind of smart. You just have to find your own way of showing it.

Muscle Man:  I think I got one more idea that will prove that I'm smart.

(Scene cuts to Open Mic Night at the Coffee Shop)

Muscle Man:  But seriously, folks, I checked his computer, right? And I told him, he has a pretty bad virus. You know who else has a pretty bad virus? My motherboard!

(The audience stays silent)

Mordecai: (looks at Rigby) Well, at least he's strong.

(End of Cube Bros)

Please discuss this article's possible deletion here.

(We begin with Cheezers, where there's a long line. Rigby can be heard groaning while in line with Mordecai, CJ and Eileen.)

Rigby: We've only three inches of this line and I'm starving!

Eileen: You just had breakfast, Rigby.

Rigby: Yeah, a whole half hour ago. Urrgh!

(We fade to inside Cheezers, where a cheese sandwich is being grilled. A waiter, carrying the food, goes to the table where the guys are sitting.)

Rigby (continued): Alright! Now we're talking!

(The waiter places the food on their table.)

Cheezers Waiter: Here you go. Four Cheddargeddons with a side of tomato bisque.

CJ: Aw yea-yuh! Cheddargeddon my stomach!

Mordecai: Haha, nice.

Rigby: Hey man, what's with the balls?

(He is refering to the yellow balls placed with their meals.)

Cheezers Waiter: Those are complimentary golf balls for our new Sink Hole ide Queso! challenge.

(It pans over to the small challenge nearby.)

Cheezers Waiter (continued): If you get a hole-in-one, your party eats for free.

Rigby: Oh, yes!

(He picks up his sandwich and throws it against the restroom door.)

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing?

Rigby: Free stuff always tastes better.

(He goes over to the challenge.)

Rigby: Now let's do this!

(Rigby starts goofily laughing while holding a golf club. He hits the ball and it bounces off goal, landing in a man's tomato soup. Rigby screams)

Rigby: Mordecai, you gotta make this shot! I don't wanna have to eat my lunch off the bathroom door!

Mordecai: Move...

(Mordecai takes a shot, but it misses, and rolls straight back to Mordecai's feet)

Rigby: No!!! Why?

Mordecai: Sorry, dude.

(Mordecai walks off as Eileen runs over)

Eileen: Oh, oh - my turn!

(Eileen takes a shot, but it doesn't even make it as far as Rigby's)

Eileen: Aw...sorry, Rigby.

Mordecai: Your turn, CJ.

CJ: Uh, that's okay. I think I'll pass.

Mordecai: Aw, come on! Just try it! You can't be any worse than us.

CJ: I just really don't like mini golf.

Rigby: Please CJ, I'm so hungry!

(CJ sighs)

CJ: Here.

(CJ takes the golf club and hits the ball, getting a hole-in-one. Fireworks shoot out of the course as the Cheezer's Mascot bursts through the wall)

Mascot: Boss! Boss! Someone won!

Chaz: Cheezers of partying approval alone, we have a winner! Chaz Melter, CEO and Founder of Cheezers. You are the first and only customer to beat the Sink Hole ide Queso! Congratulations!

(Chaz passes CJ a giant check for a free lunch)

CJ: Huh?

Chaz: Say...with skills like that, you gotta play in the Putterpalooza this weekend! Uh, sponsored by Cheezers, of course. Grand prize is a "Cut the Cheezers" card. Win one of these babies and you get to cut in the front of the line for life!

Rigby: Aw, yeayuh! No more lines!

CJ: Look - I don't wanna do this! I don't like mini golf!

Rigby: And I don't like waiting in line! We're talking about cutting in front of people and getting away with it! You're the only one who can win this for us!

Eileen: Yeah CJ, you're really good!

Mordecai: It'll be really fun, just try it and see! Think of all the time we'll save skipping all the lines.

(CJ sighs)

CJ: Okay. I'll play.

Rigby: Oh, yeayuh - Cut the Cheezers!

CJ: But I'm gonna need a little practice if I'm gonna enter the tournament.

Chaz: You don't need practice! You're gouda 'nuff to win! Heh.

(The gang stares at him)

Chaz: I get paid extra to say that.

(Cut to the Putt Hut mini-golf course)

CJ: Okay...don't get your hopes up. I'm a little rusty.

(CJ attempts a shot and gets another hole-in-one)

Rigby: That's what you call rusty?

(We see CJ get another two hole-in-ones)

Eileen: Intuitive pivoting? Angle control? You got serious skills, CJ!

Mordecai: How did I not know you were amazing at this?

CJ: Eh - I'm fully of surprises.

(She hits another ball, but it bounces off a novelty mermaid's tail and into a lake. CJ gets angry, turning slowly into a storm cloud)

CJ: How did I miss that shot!?

(CJ throws her golf club into someone's windshield)

CJ: It was so easy!

Mordecai: Whoa, whoa! CJ! No need to get upset.

Rigby: It's just mini golf.

Eileen: Is something the matter?

CJ: I can't help taking mini golf seriously. It kinda runs in the family. (sighs) My dad is Carl Putter.

Mordecai: Whoa, Carl Putter? The world champion mini-golf pro?

Eileen: That explains so much.

Rigby: Wait, so your last name is Putter?

CJ: No, that's just his mini-golf name. Look, it's not something I really like to talk about. Growing up with a mini golf legend as your dad, well - it can be pretty tough.

(Flashback to CJ's childhood. She is mini-golfing with her dad)

Carl Putter: Come on, focus! Focus!

(CJ hits a ball with her club. It almost goes in, but misses just about)

Carl: Hmm, not bad. Not bad...if you like losing! Takes a little finesse if you wanna beat your old man!

(Carl prepares himself, then gets a hole-in-one)

Carl: Haha!

CJ (voiceover): He never let me win.

(Carl is seen knocking away CJ's ball with another ball)

Carl: Ooh, too slow! In your face!

(Carl does a victory dance)

CJ (voiceover): He was a real sore winner, until I finally had enough.

(In the flashback, CJ is now at the Junior Championship Mini Golf Tournament)

Carl: Don't mess it up, don't mess it up!

(CJ hits the ball with enough speed to make it stop in front of some wooden gopher obstacles)

Carl: What are you doing!? I didn't teach you to play it safe!

CJ: But dad, I'll be able to make the next shot easy, then I can get second place.

Carl: Second place is just the first loser! You gotta go all or nothing!

(CJ gets angry and bends her putter in half)

Carl: Aw, don't take it out on the putter! It's not the putter's fault you played bad!

CJ (voiceover): And that was the last time I ever played. Until yesterday.

(Flashback to when CJ won the Sink Hole ide Queso, and her friends mutter in amazement. The flashbacks ends)

Mordecai: Jeez, CJ. I had no idea. You don't have to play in this tournament if you don't want to.

Rigby: Yes you do! You're our only hope at that "Cut the Cheezers" card! Think of the children! Me! I'm the children!

CJ: I think I still wanna play. Without my dad around, I can actually enjoy it for once.

Mordecai: Haha, awesome!

(They are interrupted by the owner of the car who's windshield was smashed by CJ)

Car Owner: Hey, my car! Who did this!? Huh? What's the matter? You don't want your club back?

(The gang back away)

Eileen: I think we've had enough practice for today.

(Cut to the next day at the Putterpalooza. CJ enters the Putt Hut and sees Rigby and Eileen holding "Go CJ!" signs)

Eileen: Go CJ!

(CJ smiles at them, but then notices a huge crowd gathering around someone)

CJ: Oh no.

(The crowd clears to reveal that Carl Putter himself is at the event, and is signing autographs.

CJ: Ugh! I knew it!

Carl: There you go! Keep on puttin' the good putt!

(He gives his autograph to a fan, as CJ storms towards him)

CJ: Dad!

Carl: Hey, Ceej!

CJ: Dad, what are you doing here?

Carl: Well, I was hitting the mini green with my old pal, Chaz Melter, the other day. And he mentioned that SOMEONE was playing in the Putterpalooza. Didn't think you'd be dusting off the old mini clubs, kiddo.

CJ: Grr - dad! I don't want you here!

Carl: Hey, I wanna see if you still have the chops to come in second place to your old man! Haha!

Mordecai: Uhh, hello Mr. Putter. My name's Mordecai, I'm dating your daughter. It's probably not my place to say anything, but what you're doing is not cool.

CJ: Forget it, Mordecai. Let's just go.

Carl: Ooh, we got a sensitive guy over here! You must not be very competitive, eh pal? I bet the only trophies you ever won were for crying, since you're so sensitive! Haha!

Crowd: Ooh!

CJ: That's it!

(CJ writes her name on the roster)

CJ: Time to put you in your place, dad!

Carl: Ooh, feeling gutsy, huh? Well, seems as I'm here, I might as well play too. Can't let you have all the fun. Haha!

(Carl writes his name on the roster)

Carl: Another first place victory for Carl Putter!

CJ: We'll see about that.

Carl: See you in the line at Cheezers, with all the other amatuers, kiddo.

CJ: Grr!

(Montage begins of CJ vs her father in mini-golf. CJ gets a hole-in-one, and is cheered on by her friends. Putter also gets a hole-in-one. We see them both score multiple times. CJ scores again)

CJ: Yes!

Everyone: CJ! CJ! CJ! CJ!

Chaz: Alright, folks! We have a tie! From here on out, this will be a sudden death putt-off! Both of you putting at the exact same time. First one to miss a shot loses!

Carl: Yeah! Never lost one of these in my life!

CJ: It's true. He never has.

Mordecai: Until now! You can do this.

Chaz: Let the sudden death round begin!

(Chaz pulls a lever, causing the whole Putt Hut to open up, magically turning it into a large course, with live crocodiles and gophers. The hole is next to a volcano)

CJ: I hate mini golf.

(CJ and her father get into position)

Carl: You first, kiddo.

CJ: No. After you.

Carl: If you insist.

(Carl hits the ball across a river and gets a hole-in-one)

Carl: Top that! Haha!

(CJ gets her ball in the hole too. There is another short montage of them both getting a hole-in-one each time. Including from the top of a hill, up-hill, across gapped steps, through a diamond field, a crocodile lake, and lastly in a cave, leading to the volcano)

Carl: End of the line, squirt!

(Carl sets up his ball, and is ready to swing)

Carl: Haha!

(A gopher suddenly bursts through a wall in the cave. CJ and her father both scream, as more gophers burst through more walls. Carl quickly takes his shot, but it misses)

Chaz: Carl Putter missed the final hole! If CJ makes this next shot, she'll win!

(Carl Putter runs off)

Carl: Come on, let's get out of here!

CJ: No. I'm gonna make this shot!

Carl: That's crazy! If I can't make it, you can't do it either!

CJ: That's just what you want me to think so you can win!

(A gopher jumps to attack her, but she hits it with her putter)

CJ: I've gotta go all or nothing! Just like you told me, remember?

(Carl Putter runs off)

Carl: Fine! All or nothing!

(Two gophers attack CJ. She screams)

Mordecai: CJ!

(Mordecai runs to CJ n the cave)

Mordecai: CJ, are you okay?

(He kicks two gophers out of the way)

CJ: Clear the path! I need to make this last shot!

(Mordecai grabs a gopher by the leg and spins it around, knocking them all out)

Mordecai: All clear!

(A giant humanoid gopher storms towards them and roars. Mordecai and CJ scream)

CJ: No! I have to beat my dad!

(Carl Putter is attempting his shot from where the ball left off, when he overhears this. He turns around and sees his daughter in danger)

Carl: Paws off my daughter while she's trying to putt!

(Carl pulls out a giant golf club which has "Eat My Driver" on it. He swings it to hit the ball, aiming towards the humanoid gopher's crotch - he hits his target, causing the gopher to collapse. Its head explodes)

Carl: Now sink that putt, CJ!

(CJ hits her ball and it zooms all the way in the air up into the final hole, making her the winner. The volcano erupts, as Mordecai and CJ run over to hug each other. Carl Putter, Chaz Melter, Rigby and Eileen follow after them)

Chaz: Congratulations, CJ! You've won the Putterpalooza!

Carl: Nice puttin', Ceej! You finally beat your old man. Sorry for being so hard on you, I was trying to prepare you for the world the only way I knew how. By crushing you at mini golf.

CJ: It's okay, dad.

(CJ hugs Carl)

CJ: 'cause I whooped your putt! 

(CJ does a victory dance while laughing. Carl sheds a tear)

Carl: I've been waiting a long time for that trash talk.

(CJ moves over to Mordecai)

CJ: Thanks for helping me out, Mordecai. No-one's ever had my back like you do.

Mordecai: Aw. Anytime, Ceej.

Chaz: CJ, here's your official "Cut the Cheezers" card.

(Chaz Melter passes CJ a "Cut the Cheezers" card)

CJ: You know, after making up with my dad, this seems kinda beside the point. Meh.

(CJ chucks the "Chuck the Cheezers" card away. Rigby gasps as the card lands in the volcano's lava. Everyone but Rigby and Eileen walks off)

Rigby: No!!! 

(Rigby starts sobbing by the lava. Eileen walks up to comfort him)

Eileen: Don't worry, Rigby. I'll wait in line at Cheezers with you. I'll wait.

(End of Daddy Issues)

(The episode opens to show a close up of the floor in Pops' House)

Mordecai: MOVIE NIGHT!
(Rigby dumps a box of DVD's on the floor)
Rigby: Let's see what we've got.
Mordecai: Hey! Love by the Dozen.
Rigby: Eegh! A romantic comedy? VETOED! (Rigby tosses Love by the Dozen somewhere else)
Eileen: Oooh, what about this one? (Eileen holds up a DVD titled Cease & Deceased) It looks creepy!
(The camera does a close up on Cease & Deceased)
Mordecai: Cease & Deceased? Nah, no scary stuff, Rigby can't handle it.
Rigby: What?!
Mordecai: Remember the time we saw Dead for Breakfast? You wouldn't eat pancakes for a week!
Rigby: I was sleeping in that week!
Mordecai: (while imitating Rigby) Oh no! The bacon is gonna get me!
(Mordecai, Margaret, and Eileen all laugh)
Rigby: You're the bacon.
Margaret: Don't you guys have anything with adventure?
Mordecai: Uhhh, let's see.
Rigby: Forget movies! We should go on a REAL adventure!
Mordecai, Margaret, and Eileen: Huh?
Rigby: Yeah! To the old, abandoned park zoo!
Mordecai: Come on, guys it's movie night! We should stay inside, and veg out on the couch.
Rigby: Hm, hm. Mordecai is just afraid we will run into Death Bear.
Margaret and Eileen: Death Bear?
Rigby: You guys have never heard of Death Bear?
Margaret: No.
Rigby: Well, gather around! (Mordecai grunts heavily) The tale of Death Bear, is a tale that's as old as fifteen to twenty years ago. He was a troubled bear that lived in the park zoo, who was evil to the core! One day, out of nowhere, he attacked an killed his trainer! The zoo was forced to close down. But Death Bear wouldn't leave, so he still roams the old abandoned zoo, getting more evil over the years, only to be able to survive by breaking into people's homes, eating all of their food, and then eating THEM!
Margaret and Eileen: Whoa!
Mordecai: Pfft. Lame. Death Bear is a dumb old urban legend. Come on storytime is over. Let's get this movie started. Right? Yeah. (Mordecai picks up a bowl of popcorn on the coffee table, and sniffs it) Mmm, semi-burnt popcorn! Saved you a seat right here, Margaret. (Mordecai pats the cushion of the couch)
Rigby: Yeah, see, I told you! Scared of Death Bear!
Mordecai: What?! Death Bear isn't even REAL! You know I'm not scared, right Margaret?
Margaret: Mordecai, it's alright. If you don't want to go, I mean, it does sound pretty scary.
Mordecai: What?! No! It's just that it is supposed to be movie night.
Rigby: Excuses, excuses man! Look, if you are not scared of Death Bear, then I dare you to take a picture inside Death Bear's cage!
Margaret and Eileen: Ooooooooh!
Mordecai: No dude, that's just dumb.
Margaret: Come on! It will be an exciting adventure!
Eileen: Yeah, and all descelent, and spooky.
Margaret: Eileen, we are trying to make him NOT scared.
Mordecai: I'M NOT SCARED! (Margaret, Eileen, and Rigby all start to murmur then 'Mordecai lets out a deep sigh.) Okay, fine. We'll go to the abandoned zoo and take a picture in a dumb bear cage.
Margaret: Yeah, alright!
Eileen: This is going to be fun!
Rigby: (Runs upstairs) I'll get the camera!
Margaret: We'll watch a movie another night, I promise.
Mordecai: We better.
Margaret: (while pushing Mordecai in the shoulder) Such a pouter! (Margaret giggles)
Rigby: (sliding down the stair-rail with a camera)Yes! Death Bear! (An echo approaches when Rigby yells "Death Bear." The scene then transitions to the gang at the abandoned zoo) There it is!
Eileen: Neat! (Eileen puts her head into the mouth of a lion statue) Check it out! I'm a lion tamer! Ahhhhh!
(Mordecai and Rigby stare at her in confusion)
Margaret: (while struggling to get the gate open) Eugh! The gate's locked!
Eileen: (while climbing on top of the lion statue) Aw man!
Rigby: (while running to the gate) No way!
Mordecai: Oh well, I guess it wasn't meant to be. But we still have enough time for movie night, know what I'm saying? Let's go back to-
Rigby: Hey! I found a way in!
Margaret: (while running to the hole in the gate that Rigby found) Cool!
Eileen: Way to go, Rigby!
Mordecai: Wait! But-
Margaret: You coming, Mordecai?
Rigby: (while imitating Margaret) Yeah, Mordecai, you coming?
Mordecai: Ehhh, you are enjoying this, aren't you?
Rigby: Hm, hm! (Mordecai and Rigby go through the hole in the gate, then the scene transitions to them in the Park Zoo) Cool!
Eileen: It is so weird without any animals.
Margaret: Yeah, it's like the end of the world, or something!
Mordecai: You're not afraid, are you?
Margaret: Ha! Yeah right, you're the big chicken here!
Mordecai: What?
(The gang finds the Reptile House.)
Rigby: Aw yeah, reptile building! Think you can handle going in there?
Mordecai: Pffft! Step aside!
(The gang is now inside the Reptile House.)
Eileen: Do you think Death Bear is real?
Rigby: Heck yeah he's real! He's probably waiting for us on the other side of this building!
Mordecai: No he's not, dude, there's no one here.
(A squirrel comes out of a broken reptile tank, much to Mordecai's surprise, he screams and falls on his butt. Rigby laughs hysterically.)
Eileen: Aww, how cute!
Rigby: Maybe I should take the lead, there might be more SQUIRRELS up ahead!
(Rigby and Eileen run off, leaving Mordecai and Margaret by themselves. Margaret helps Mordecai up)
Margaret: You okay?
Mordecai: Yeah, I'm fine.
(Mordecai and Margaret exit the Reptile House)
Margaret: You sure you can handle Death Bear? That squirrel was pretty scary back there.
Mordecai: I wasn't scared, I was just surprised. There's a difference, you know.
Margaret: Oh yeah, sure. You looked pretty scared to me. Boo!
Mordecai: (sarcastically) Ha ha! (Mordecai rolls his eyes at Margaret) No seriously though, we acutally came to the zoo a couple of times when we were kids, you know?
Margaret: Oh, cool!
Mordecai: Yeah, it was pretty cool. The only thing I didn't like was the bear.
Margaret: So you ARE scared of Death Bear? (Margaret giggles)
Mordecai: Well, yeah, when I was little. It was just a regular bear though. (Mordecai sees something that catches his attention) Oh, no way! I totally remember this! (The thing that catches his attention is a little, ride-along train that is abandoned along with the rest of the zoo. One car is seen laying sideways on the platform of the station. Mordecai runs toward it.) This was my FAVORITE part about coming to the zoo! (Mordecai puts his hands on the roof of the locomotive.) I loved riding this train. The conductor would yell "All aboard!", and I would race to get the first seat I could!
(Mordecai runs toward a train car, and sits in it. Mordecai lets out a breath of relaxation.)
Margaret: (while walking up to the train car Mordecai is sitting in) Sounds like a good time! Scooch! (Margaret sits with Mordecai) Kinda small.
Mordecai: I can get out...
Margaret: No, I don't mind. It's cozy.
Mordecai: Oh. Yeah. Heh.
Margaret: So, where are we going?
Mordecai: Hmmm. (Mordecai is pretending to talk to a conductor while trying to imitate a man with his wife from the 1920's.) Conductor! Take us somewhere exotic please, and mind the bumps, my lady does not like getting ill! Thank you!
(Mordecai and Margaret laugh until the point where it starts to get into "heh's" back and forth until they are both silent. Margaret has a huge smile on her face when staring at Mordecai. Then out of nowhere, Rigby comes and kills the moment by yelling out a window of an abandoned complex in the zoo.)
Rigby: Hey guys, over here! We found some more train tracks!
(The scene then transitions to the gang walking on the newly-found train tracks. The gang eventually find a metal tunnel.)
Eileen: Oh, rad! Everybody, scream through the tunnel!
(Eileen and Rigby scream through the tunnel)
Mordecai: After you!
Margaret: Oh, what a gentlemen! (Margaret screams through the tunnel, then laughs with Eileen on the other side) Wait, where's Mordecai? (Margaret faces the tunnel) Mordecai! (loud echo) Hello? (loud echo) Morde-
Mordecai: MARGARET!
(Margaret screams. Mordecai laughs)
Margaret: Ugh, what are you doing?!
Mordecai: I went around!
Margaret: Ugh, don't do that!
(Margaret shoves Mordecai in anger)
Mordecai: What? It's funny!
(The gang follows the train tracks again only to discover that the metal rails have been pulled up, leading them to a dead end.)
Rigby: Aw, what?
Margaret: Now which way?
(Rigby and Eileen look around. Eileen finds something on the ground)
Eileen: Whoa, check it out guys!
(It turns out to be a footprint of something large. Margaret walks over to it.)
Margaret: Is that a footprint?
Eileen: It's huge!
(Mordecai and Rigby walk over to it)
Mordecai: Nah, it can't be. It's just a hole in the dirt.
Rigby: No man, it's Death Bear! This way!
(The gang walks over to a bear cage that has a huge hole in the bars, the same size as the hole in the gate earlier on.)
Eileen: Uhh, I think we found it.
Rigby: Yeah, that's definitly it!
(The gang walks through the hole into the bear cage.)
Mordecai: Okay, well, we're here. Let's take the picture and go.
Rigby: Oh, no! This is just the entrance. Anybody can take a picture in here. We are going to the real cage, down through there!
(Rigby turns around and points to a small door in the back of the cage that is open.)
Margaret and Eileen: What?!
Mordecai: No way, dude. We're not going down there!
Rigby: Why not? I thought you weren't scared!
(Rigby opens the door with a sinister laugh)
Mordecai: Rigby! Agh!
Eileen: Well?
Margaret: You coming?
(Mordecai, Margaret, and Eileen go through the door)
Mordecai: Rigby?!
Rigby: Whoa, awesome!
(Rigby runs down an aisle of various bear cages)
Mordecai: Agh, Rigby! Where are you?!
Rigby: (off-screen) Hurry up!
(Eileen looks inside a cage as she is passing by that holds a stray bone)
Eileen: Feels like we shouldn't be in here.
Margaret: Rigby, come on!
Rigby: (off-screen) I'm not stopping 'till I find Death Bear!
Mordecai: Dude, quit messing around!
(Rigby laughs from a long distance)
Mordecai: Dude, forget it! We're going back. Come on, guys.
(Mordecai, Margaret and Eileen are one second on their way back only to hear Rigby screaming)
Mordecai, Margaret, and Eileen: Rigby?!
(They all race down to the end, hoping to save Rigby.)
Mordecai: Rigby! Rigby!!!
(Rigby is on the other side of a wall. He jumps right in front of the gang with a loud scream. It scares them so much that Mordecai and Margaret are holding each other, and all three of them fall down on their butts. In despite all of this, Rigby is laughing hysterically.)
Mordecai: Dude?! What the heck?!
Rigby: Oh, man! You should have seen your faces! (Rigby laughs) You really, you really believed! (Rigby laughs again)
Margaret: Dude! You almost gave us heart attacks.
Eileen: We thought Death Bear got you!
(Rigby laughs hysterically)
Rigby: Death Bear's not real! It's just a myth! You guys totally fell for it!
Mordecai: Whatever. Can we go back to the house now?
Rigby (while trying to regain his breath): Sure, sure. But let's take the picture first. (Rigby sets the camera on a rock and sets the timer. The gang lines up for a picture) Okay, get ready.
Eileen: Hey, what's this door for? (She is referring to a metal door that is in back of them)
Rigby: I don't know, I'm not a zookeeper. (The camera captures the moment, and takes a picture. The picture comes out through the slot of the camera) Sweet! Ha ha! Man, I got you guys good, you gotta admit it!
Mordecai: Yeah, yeah.
(Mordecai and Margaret walk off, leaving Rigby and Eileen alone)
Eileen: Well, you got ME good, Rigby!
Rigby: Yeah, Death Bear's really going to be living down here. (Rigby knocks on the metal door, pretending that Death Bear is in there). Uh, hello? Death Bear? You home?!
(Rigby and Eileen let out a small laugh)
Eileen: Yeah, uhhh, (Eileen knocks on the door) the pizzas you ordered are here!
(Rigby and Eileen let out a small laugh.)
Margaret: You were holding me pretty tight for someone who is not scared!
Mordecai: What? No! You were totally holding onto ME! (Mordecai and Margaret let out a small laugh.)
(Rigby is shaking the developed photo trying to make it appear.)
Rigby: Aw, man! These things take forever to show up!
Eileen: Actually, you're not supposed to shake it.
Rigby: Oh, hey, do you know what this piece does? (He points to the lens of the camera)
Eileen: Yeah, you see, you just turn it, like this.
(Eileen turns the knob on the lens. The metal door that Rigby and Eileen were knocking on opens very slowly.)
Margaret: So, you still wish you were just watching a movie?
Mordecai: No, this was pretty fun, I mean, I got to hang out with you, so, that's all that matters.
(Margaret lets out a small laugh, then Mordecai leans over, hoping to kiss Margaret)
Margaret: Uh, Mordecai?
Mordecai: Yeahhhhhh?
(Margaret pulls his head over to her lips, hoping to kiss Mordecai, but then, she notices something in back of him)
Margaret: What is that?!
Mordecai: Huh?!
(It turns out that the door really DID hold Death Bear, and he is making an apperance (at the worst, possible time), creeping through the door, disgruntled, as Rigby described him back at the house. Eileen and Rigby let out whimpers, and then Death Bear lets out a huge growl, showing his breath which knocks off Rigby's orange beanie hat. They both step back towards Mordecai and Margaret, and Death Bear lets out a huge growl, scaring the daylights out of the four of them. They run out hoping to lose him.)
Rigby: OH MY GOSH! DEATH BEAR'S REAL!!!
Mordecai: Oh man, I'm gonna kill you for this, Rigby!
Eileen: I think Death Bear's going to take care of that!
Margaret: Quit it! Don't say that!
(The gang, still in hot pursuit, run through the hole in the cage. Death Bear fits through perfectly, stating that Death Bear was the one who made it. They keep running until they get back up to the house. The gang runs through the door, and Mordecai slams the door shut, trying to block Death Bear from coming in. This is unsucessful, as Death Bear uses his pickelhaube on his head to try to charge in the door. Mordecai backs away with the rest of the gang)
Mordecai: Quick! Everybody barricade the door!
(Mordecai, Margaret, and Rigby go look for furniture to barricade the door with)
Eileen: I'll call animal control!
(Eileen goes to a nearby phone, and punches in the number for animal control. Meanwhile, Margaret and Rigby use a cabinet to barricade the door, and Mordecai uses a bookshelf. Death Bear demolishes the entire front entrance, knocking Margaret and Rigby to a corner, and Mordecai trapped underneath the bookshelf. Death Bear then sees Eileen, on the phone with animal control)
Animal Control Operator: Hello, Animal Control, Hello?
(Death Bear then moves in. He walks toward Eileen. Meanwhile, Rigby is with Margaret in a corner, squealing.) 
Mordecai: (gasps) Eileen!
(Mordecai lifts the bookshelf and frees himself. He runs toward Eileen while Death Bear is creeping up on her. Eileen, still on the phone, is whimpering in fear. Suddenly, Death Bear charges toward Eileen, hoping to kill her, but out of nowhere, Mordecai tackles Death Bear so hard that Death Bear goes right through a wall. Margaret now has a expression on her face.)
Eileen: (still on the phone with animal control) Yes, come quick! It's Death Bear!
Mordecai: Everyone upstairs, quick!
(The gang runs up the stairs. Death Bear is on the bottom growling at them)
Eileen: Animal Control is on its way!
(Two Animal Control officers charge in through the kitchen door, with tranquilizer guns aimed at Death Bear)
Animal Control Officer #1: It's Death Bear, take him down!
(They both rapidly fire at Death Bear, but none of the trainquilizer bullets are powerful enough to knock out Death Bear. Death Bear then judo-kicks one officer, and then roundhouses another officer. Meanwhile, another officer jumps from a rope, only to have Death Bear slice his arms off with his claws.)
Animal Control Officer #2: I wanna go home...
(Death Bear then throws another officer onto the balcony where the gang is. Mordecai picks it up, and tries to get the safety latch off, accidentally shooting Rigby with a tranquilizer bullet in the process.)
Rigby (in slow-motion voice): Whattttt thhhhe heck, mannnnnnnn?!
Mordecai: Sorry!
(Death Bear lets out a huge growl, then charges up the stairs. Mordecai screams his head off, and sweating crazy trying to take down Death Bear by rapidly firing at him. It doesn't work, even though thirty bullets went in his face. Death Bear makes it to the stop of the stairs. Mordecai, who is still screaming and sweating, tries to take him down. Finally, Death Bear has enough tranquil in his system to knock him out. Mordecai tries to catch his breath.)
(The scene transitions to them outside the next morning watching Death Bear being airlifted by helicopter to an animal sanctuary)
Eileen: Poor Death Bear.
Mordecai: Don't worry about him. He'll be fine. Those animal sanctuaries are like five-star hotels.
Margaret: Hey, so thanks for saving all of our lives and stuff. That was really brave of you.
Mordecai: To be honest, I was pretty scared.
Margaret: Yeah, but that's what made you brave. Well, I'll see you later, yeah?
(Margaret hugs Mordecai)
Mordecai: Yeah... cool.
Eileen: You weren't exactly brave, Rigby, but you are pretty cool.
Rigby: Thannnnks, you tooooooo!
Margaret: Hey, so how did that picture turn out?
(Rigby takes out the picture, but it shows that he only took a picture of their feet)
Mordecai: Aw, what?
Mordecai, Margaret, and Eileen: Rigby!
(The episode ends.)
(The episode starts with Mordecai and Rigby going to Death Kwon Do: Pizza and Subs)

Mordecai & Rigby: Lunch! Lunch! Lunch! Lunch! Lunch! Lunch!

Sensai: Welcome back to Death Kwon Do: Pizza and Subs! Can I start you off with a couple of sodas?

Mordecai: Sure, dude!

Sensai: Jerry! Two sodas!

Jerry: Yes, Sensai! (he kicks a cup into the air, catches it, puts it in a machine and presses a button with two fingers to pour soda into the cup)

Rigby: Who's that?

Sensai: That's my Death Kwon Do apprentice, Jerry!

Rigby: Oh, that's cool.

Mordecai: Uh, and to eat... everything's kinda heavy... (sighs) I wish I could get something light that still tastes good.

Sensai: (laughs) I get it! You want the Death Kwon Do Sandwich of Health!

(Fade to Sensai in the kitchen. He is in a state of concentration)

Sensai (continued, VO): Through years of trial and error, I perfected it.

(He ki yaps and begin messaging a raw steak. He is then shown holding vegetables in his hands. He throws them up in the air. He karate chops the tomato, then headbutts the lettuce. The vegetables land in the bottom half of the sandwich bread, the top half immediately following. Sensai has a taste test. He then squirts a bowl of meatballs with sauce.)

Sensai (continued, VO): Using the finest organic ingredients, and the secrets of Death Kwon Do, I have created a sandwich that not only tastes great...it's a healthy as a salad.

(Scene clouds out to the completed sandwich.)

Sensai (continued): Would you be the first to try it?

Mordecai: Thar's just a meatball sub.

Rigby: Yeah, and if I'm being honest, it look even greasier than usual.

(Jerry walks up behind Sensai with the sodas.)

Sensai: It is not! It's incredibly healthy! Every day, I have one for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've never felt better.

(He takes a bite of the sandwich.)

Sensai (continued): Ugh, my stomach!

(He falls backwards. Everyone looks down in worry and shock.)

Jerry: Sensai!

(Scene cuts to the hospital.)

Dr. Matthews: Yep. Yep, you definitely need a stomach transplant.

Mordecai, Rigby, Sensai and Jerry: What?!

Dr. Matthews: You had an extreme reaction...uh, wait, scratch that. You had a completely normal reaction to an extremely unhealthy sandwich. Thwn you stomach flat-out exploded. See?

(He points to an x-ray of the stomach.)

Rigby: Can you put him on the transplant list?

Dr. Matthews: Well, yes. Normally you'd be able to, but a man of your...physical gifts would burn through a normal stomach like it was nothing.

Sensai: Spell it out for me, Doc.

Dr. Matthews: You're too, uhh,...How do put this delicately?

(He suddenly gets an idea. He starts doing motions of moving something fat.)

Jerry: Hey!

Mordecai: Aw, come on!

Rigby: That's just wrong!

Mordecai: Not cool, man!

Dr Matthews: Well, you're too weak to be moved, and we need a suitable transplant or you'll die.

Sensai: What about the Death Kwon Do Hospital?

(He turns to Jerry.)

Sensai (continued): Could you call them?

(Jerry runs off.)

Jerry: Yes, Sensai!

(Cut to the phone at Death Kwon Do Hospital. It rings, and someone answers.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor: Death Kwon Do Hospital.

(Cut to Jerry on the phone.)

Jerry: Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hmm? You do have a stomach of great power?

(Mordecai and Rigby are glad.)

Jerry (continued): And we can pick it up today?!

Sensai: Excellent.

Rigby: Yes!

Sensai: Mordecai and Rigby, would you mind going with Jerry to pick up the stomach?

Mordecai: Sure, dude.

Rigby: Yeah. We're still on lunch anyway, so...

Jerry: Sensai, I don't need their help! I'm ready for this!

Sensai: No, Jerry!

(Jerry angrily slams down the phone and bows his head.)

Jerry: Yes, Sensai.

(Sensai grunts in stomach pain.)

Sensai: You don't have much time. As always, you'll need these.

(He holds up jean shorts for Mordecai and Rigby, which they take.)

(Transition to the next scene where Mordecai, Rigby and Jerry overlook the Death Kwon Do hospital from a cliff edge. They take a boat to the hospital boat dock and run up a path panting.)

(They run past lion statues which shoot out flames at them. They run through quickly. When they are clear of the statues, the path in front of them collapses, revealing a pit full of snakes with mullets. They flip over the pit, and they land in front of the Death Kwon Do hospital entrance. The door opens and they walk through. The interior of the Death Kwon Do hospital looks exactly like a regular one, and the three run through into an elevator and wait until it reaches the 8th floor. Jerry opens the door to the transplant room, and they enter. The stomach is in a bell jar on top of an altar.)

Mordecai: There it is.

(Shows close up of the stomach.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor: You have come... for the stomach. But first you must prove you are worthy... for the stomach.

(He claps his hands.)

(Three curtains with caucuses on them are opened, revealing the Tongue Depressor Intern, Gurney Intern and CPR Intern.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor: My interns have mastered all the most difficult Death Kwon Do medical arts: tongue depressor!

(The Tongue Depressor Intern throws two tongue depressors which plant themselves in the wall behind Jerry, Mordecai and Rigby. They bear surprised expressions.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor (continued): The gurney!

(The Gurney Intern spins a gurney around)

Death Kwon Do Doctor (continued): And CPR.

(The CPR Intern performs a CPR motion in the air in front of him.)

Mordecai, Rigby and Jerry: Hyaaaaaah!

(Zooms in on Death Kwon Do Doctor's face.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor: Attack!

(The three interns charge at Mordecai, Rigby and Jerry)

(The Tongue Depressor Intern jumps in the air and Jerry catches the intern's arm.)

Tongue Depressor Intern: Say "ah"!

(Jerry struggles to keep the Tongue Depressor Intern's arm away from his tongue.)

(Meanwhile, Mordecai and Rigby charge at the other two. Rigby jumps at the Gurney Intern with his fist outstretched.)

Rigby: In your face of death!

(The Gurney Intern lifts his gurney up, deflecting Rigby's punch. Rigby falls to the ground. The Gurney Intern starts riding his gurney towards Rigby.)

Rigby: Aaaugh!

(Mordecai is fighting the CPR Intern. He strikes Mordecai with a CPR attack)

Mordecai: Death block!

(The CPR Intern attacks again, and Mordecai blocks again.)

Mordecai (continued): Death block!

(Mordecai flips over the CPR Intern and kicks him from behind. He flies backwards and disappears in a flash of light.)

(The Gurney Intern has Rigby against the edge of the gurney, which is moving at a fast speed. Rigby lowers himself under the gurney and crawls upside-down on the underside of it. The Gurney Intern loses sight of him.)

Rigby: Hey!

(Rigby runs up to the Gurney Intern.)

Rigby: Hyah! 

(He kicks the intern in the chest, who vanishes in a beam of light.)

(Jerry still struggles to fight the Tongue Depressor Intern, whose tongue depressor in Jerry's mouth. He hits the Tongue Depressor Intern's arm and deflects the tongue depressor back at him. The Tongue Depressor Intern disappears in a flash of light. Jerry lands on the ground.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor: (Clapping) Nicely done. You have proven yourselves worthy.

(He lifts the lid off of the bell jar, and the stomach makes a growling noise.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Woah... 

(The Death Kwon Do Doctor puts the stomach into a cooler and closes it.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor: Let me just top you off with some ice there.

(He scoops ice into the cooler.)

Death Kwon Do Doctor (continued): Now be careful, this is my last one.

Jerry (from behind): That's alright. Betrayal of death!

(He attacks the Death Kwon Do Doctor from behind, who is vanquished in a flash of bright light.)

Jerry (continued): One is all I need.

Mordecai: Dude, what?!

Jerry: Did you really think I came all this way for that jerk, Sensai? He worked me day and night with menial tasks completely unrelated to Death Kwon Do sandwich-making!

(Shows Jerry washing windows with his foot; combining bottles of ketchup, while with legs outstretched on two chairs; Sensai throwing a block of ice on Jerry's chest, which he crushes; and Sensai giving Jerry a paycheck.)

Jerry (continued, VO): "Wash the windows, Jerry-San", "marry the ketchup, Jerry-San", "crush the ice, Jerry-San", "This job pays minimum wage, Jerry-San"!

(Shows a vault of Death Kwon Do Sandwiches of Health. Sensai closes the vault and eats one of the sandwiches.)

Jerry (continued, VO): But worst of all, he'd never let me try his precious Sandwich of Health! "It's still experimental, Jerry-San; all in good time, Jerry-San"!

(Shows Jerry breaking the lock on the vault, yelling "Eagle claw of death!" and opening it.)

Jerry (continued, VO): I couldn't take it anymore! So one night, I snuck in after hours and ate the forbidden sandwich.

(Shows Jerry eating one of the sandwiches and then several more.)

Jerry (continued, VO): It was delicious. I couldn't get enough. Every night I would try it again, and again, and again, like a whole bunch of times.

(Cuts back to the hospital.)

Jerry (continued): And now, I need a new stomach, and I think this one will do nicely.

Mordecai: Yeah? Well you're gonna have to find another one, cause that one belongs to the Sensai.

(Show several close-ups on Mordecai and Jerry's angry faces.)

(A "ding" is heard from the elevator opening.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Huh?

(Jerry grins.)

Jerry: Jump kick of deeeeeeeath!

(Jerry flies through the elevator door.)

Mordecai: Get him!

(Mordecai and Rigby run after Jerry.)

Rigby: (Vigorously bangs on the elavator door.) Rrrrrrrrrr!

Mordecai: Come on, the stairs!

(They run down the stairs while Jerry takes the elevator.)

Jerry: (Waits for the elevator to reach the bottom floor) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

(Jerry is already escaping on the boat.)

(Mordecai and Rigby exit the Death Kwon Do hospital panting with exhaustion.)

Mordecai: Now what?!

(The two notice a man getting out of his boat holding a box as he walks towards another man, presumably his boss.)

Boss: Randal, Randal, Randal. You're late again! And why don't you ever tie up your boat? Something's gonna happen to your boat!

Randal: Hey, you do your job, pencil-neck, I'll do mine.

(Mordecai and Rigby escape on Randal's boat.)

(Randal's boss punches the box out of Randal's arm and Randal kicks him in the face.)

Jerry: [laughs]

(Groans as his stomach rumbles.)

(He sees Mordecai and Rigby beside him on their boat.)

Rigby: Death jump!

(He death jumps onto Jerry's boat and kicks him in the face. Rigby grabs onto the cooler.)

Rigby: Got it Morde- ow!

(Jerry kicks Rigby off his balance. The cooler flies into the air and Mordecai catches it. Jerry then kicks Mordecai, but he keeps the cooler in his hands. They fight for the stomach.)

Rigby: Death jump!

Jerry: Kick of death!

Mordecai: Roll of death!

Jerry: Run on top of two boats of death!

(Jerry grabs the cooler from Mordecai)

Jerry: Aha!

(The two boats stray further apart, with Jerry's legs outstretched on them.)

Jerry: Oh no.

(The boats continue onward.)

Jerry: Auuugh!

(Mordecai and Rigby try to grab the cooler, but Jerry manages to keep it away from them.)

(The boats move quickly towards a wooden post.)

Mordecai, Rigby and Jerry: Aaaaaugh!

(Jerry gets hit in the crotch by the post and falls into the water, and Mordecai and Rigby continue onwards with the cooler in their hands now.)

Rigby: Mordecai!

(He throws the cooler up and Mordecai death jumps to catch it, then lands on the boat Rigby is on)

Mordecai & Rigby: Yay-yeah!

(They escape in the boat, leaving Jerry behind.)

(Jerry emerges from the water.)

Jerry: Noooo!

(He sinks back into the water.)

(Cuts back to the Hospital, where Sensai is lying in a hospital bed with the nurse drawing on his belly in marker.)

Sensai: Miss, what are you doing?

Nurse: Just marking the incision, sir.

(Shows that she has just drawn a simple dashed line and a pair of scissors.)

Nurse: Now don't you worry, Mr Sensai. Mordecai and Rigby brought back a nice little Death Kwon Do stomach for you.

(Shows the Doctor opening the cooler to be blasted with a bright ray of light. He then closes the cooler quickly.)

Sensai: And what of young Jerry, my worthless apprentice?

Nurse: Oh, he ended up being a traitor or something. Wanted to take the Death Kwon Do stomach for himself - and kill you, you know. [laughs uneasily]

Sensai: Phew.

(Shows Mordecai and Rigby sitting in a seating area above the hospital room watching with food.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Lunch! Lunch! Lunch!

(They eat.)

(The scene cuts back to the room below.)

Dr. Matthews: Uh, Nurse, after you're done washing up, could you help me out over here?

(The Nurse nods and walks over shortly. After she walks away, Jerry, disguised as a doctor, enters the room.)

(The Nurse is with the doctor talking about the stomach and the light it is giving off.)

Nurse: Hmm... Well, have you tried-

(She opens the cooler and is blasted with light.)

Nurse: Or... How about-

(She opens the cooler again while the scene moves towards Sensai on the bed. Jerry walks up to him and laughs. Sensai notices Jerry.)

(Sensai gets off the bed and Jerry takes off his mask and grins.)

(Sensai glares at Jerry and Jerry smiles sinisterly back. The scene zooms in on their faces once more and then they begin to fight. Jerry chops the bed in half.) 

Mordecai, Rigby, Nurse and Dr. Matthews: [all gasp]

(The doctor and Nurse turn around to see Jerry and Sensai fighting.)

Sensai: I should have known you would betray me. You will never learn the final virtue of Death Kwon Do!

Jerry: But I have been training for almost three weeks!

Mordecai: The Sensai needs us.

(Mordecai and Rigby run, while Rigby is still drinking a soda.)

Jerry: Now the apprentice will become the master, and the master will become a loser with no stomach!

(The two groan in stomach pain and look at the cooler with the stomach, then back at each other.)

(Mordecai and Rigby run across a hallway to the transplant room. They open the door, which is not actually the transplant room.)

Mordecai: Alright Jerry, prepare to get your butt kicked-

(There is a random patient shown with a full body cast on a bed.)

Patient: Are you here to give me my sponge bath?

Mordecai: Uh, sorry. Wrong room.

(They exit.)

Rigby: Did we make a wrong turn or something?

(Cuts back to the transplant room where Sensai and Jerry are preparing to battle.)

Dr. Matthews: No! You can't win this, Sensai.

Sensai: Don't worry. The cornered and wounded animal has a burst of adrenaline when he's fighting for his life.

(He poses, preparing an attack.)

Sensai (continued): Wounded adrenaline bear style!

(He performs punches and charges at Jerry. Jerry kicks him in the stomach and he hits the wall and falls to the floor.)

Sensai: In pain bear style. Expended too much internally too fast bear style...

(He closes his eyes.)

Sensai: Dying bear style.

Jerry: (panting) Change of plans, doc. Same surgery; new patient.

Dr. Matthews: Well, that's completely unethical. And if you think-

(Jerry jump-kicks Doctor Matthews. He flies through the door and hits the wall in the hallway, which Mordecai and Rigby hear.)

Rigby: Doctor Matrhews!

(Jerry points to the nurse with his foot, then to the cooler, then to his stomach.)

Jerry: You. That. In here. I am pointing to my stomach.

Nurse: But I'm a nurse, not a doctor; I don't know anything about stomach surgery.

(Zooms in on Jerry's angry face.)

Jerry: Ugh! Fine, I'll do it myself! [snaps fingers thoughtfully] Now let me see here...

(Grabs the mouthpiece of a canister nearby and turns the valve.)

Jerry (continued): Let's get things started with some anaesthesia.

(Puts the mouthpiece to his mouth.)

Jerry (continued): Just a little whiff~

(He falls unconscious.)

(Mordecai and Rigby punch open the door.)

Rigby: You're going down, Jerry!

(Sees Sensai and Jerry on the floor.)

Rigby: Well that was easy.

(Doctor Matthews walks up behind Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: Come on, doc. Let's get the Sensai.

(Dr. Matthews and Mordecai lift Sensai onto the bed.)

Jerry: [groans]

(Dr Matthews, Mordecai and Rigby hear Jerry, who has woken up.)

(Jerry is half-conscious, but still up.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Eugh!

(Jerry begins walking towards the three.)

Jerry: Must... Get... Stomach!

Rigby: Time for some alternative medicine!

Mordecai & Rigby: Death Kwon jump!

(They land in front of Jerry and begin punching and kicking him.)

Jerry: (Unaffected): [laughs] I feel no pain at all!

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other and again start punching and kicking Jerry. They then punch him hard in the face and he is crushed and electrocuted by an x-ray machine.)

Jerry: Okay... I felt that.

(Scene transitions to the waiting room, where Sensai is on a wheelchair steered by the doctor.)

Dr. Matthews: The transplant was a success!

Mordecai & Rigby: Aw, yay-yeah!

(Jerry is wheeled into the room on a wheelchair by a policeman.)

Jerry: Rrrr, let me go!

Sensai: Jerry-San, you were too impatient for me to teach you the most important Death Kwon Do virtue of all: patience.

(Shows close up of Jerry's angry face glaring at Sensai.)

Rigby: That's alright. He'll have plenty of time to learn that in prison!

(They all laugh as Jerry is taken away.)

Mordecai: Heh heh, he's going to prison.

Sensai: So, I've got an opening for a new apprentice?

Rigby: Thanks, but we need to get back to work.

Mordecai: Yeah, Benson hates it when we take these six-hour lunches.

(End of Death Kwon Do-Livery.)

(Mordecai turns on the television, Rigby inserts the game cartridge in the console and Mordecai presses the power button on the console.)

Announcer on game: D-d-d-d-daaaaa-Dig Champs!

Rigby: Dude, these are probably the best graphics I've ever seen in my life.

Mordecai: Dude, it looks just like the cover.

(Mordecai and Rigby chuckle at the cover of the game and the game itself, with the cover obviously looking better and different then the actual game.)

Mordecai: Oh man. Dude, let's play it.

Rigby: Woah, woah, woah! You can't play game like this right out of the box. We should stretch it out first. We don't want to pull our "hammies," know what I'm sayin'? Hey, whatta ya doin'?

Mordecai: Starting. Hurry up, and, pick your character. Hehehe!

Rigby: Aw, what? I wanted to be player one!

Mordecai: Dude, I'm player one. You're player two.

Rigby: I don't wanna be player two! He just digs with a sucky pick axe! I want the one with the shovel!

Mordecai: Dude, they're exactly the same.

Rigby: Then why don't you be player two?

Mordecai: Pfft. I'm not using that sucky pick axe.

Rigby: (gasps) See?!

Mordecai: Dude, calm down. Let's play Punchies to see who gets to be player one.

Rigby: Fine.

(Rigby tries to punch Mordecai. He fails. Mordecai then punches Rigby and wins.)

Rigby: Ahh!

Mordecai: Looks like I'm player one.

Rigby: (on-screen) No! It's not fair! You always get your way! (Mockingly): Let's play Punchies, let's play Punchies. I'm sick of it! (off-screen) Of course I'm not gonna beat you at punchies.

Mordecai: Dude, you don't beat anybody at punchies.

Rigby: Yes I do.

Mordecai: No you don't.

(A series of flashbacks is shown. Rigby and Muscle Man are playing punchies. Muscle Man wins. Pops with his eyes closed punches Rigby to the wall.)

Rigby: (screams)

(In the last flashback, seemingly drunk Mordecai and Pops see also seemingly drunk Skips punch Rigby. Rigby is being taken off by a helicopter presumably to a hospital.)

Mordecai: We-oo! We-oo! We-oo! Quick, doctor, both of these butt cheeks are unrecognizable. If we want anyone to be able to recognize this as a butt in the future, then we're gonna have to do a complete butt transplant, stat!

Rigby: STOP TALKING!!! There was only damage to the one cheek and you know it!

Mordecai: Hahaha! That's right! We used to call you the One Cheek Wonder! Dude, I'm bringin' it back.

Rigby: You better not!

Muscle Man: Is that One Cheek wonder? I hope he's not trying to play Punchies with cheeks like that!

M&MM: (off-screen) Hahahahahaha!

(Close up of Rigby's butt cheeks. Rigby covers them with his tail.)

Rigby: Shut up! Don't look at them! I'll win at punchies, you'll see!

(Rigby runs to his and Mordecai's room.)

Rigby: Wahhh!!! (Jumps on Mordecai's bed.) Ugh! Ugh! Dumb Mordecai! I hate you!

Mordecai (downstairs): You better not be messing up my side of the room.

Rigby: (Yells and grabs a book) YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE!!! (throws book at the door, it bounces of and hits him in the face) Oww!!! (screeches in pain continually off-screen)

(A frustrated Mordecai puts on headphones and plays the video game.)

Rigby: Ughh! Stupid bo... (notices) ...ok?

(An interested Rigby looks at the phone book, which says "Death Kwon Do.")

Rigby: Death Kwon Do? "Learn kicks, chops and punches in moments. Unlock your full potential today"? Yeees...

(Cut to the "Death Kwon Do" building.)

Sensei: It's a touching story. Really, it is. But I don't know if you're ready for Death Kwon Do.

Rigby: Why not?

Sensei: Death Kwon Do is all about self-defense. But, from the sound of it, you just want to hit harder.

Rigby: Uhhhh....no? Can you just teach me something?

Sensei: Hmm. Determination. I like that. Okay, I'll teach you some beginner defensive moves. All you gotta do is pick from the sacred text of Death Kwon Do.

(Sensei holds up a book titled "Death Kwon Do.")

Sensei: Let's see, we can start you off with "Bicep Flex of Death." Or there's the "Leg Lifts of Death." That's a good beginner's move. Or the "Pelvic Thrust of Death." That's one of my personal favorites.

(Rigby is searching for moves in the book.)

Rigby: That one. That's the one I want. "The Death Punch."

Sensei: That I'm afraid is not for beginners.

Rigby: What, why?

Sensei: Because you only want to use it to beat up your friends. You're not pure of heart!

Rigby: [on-screen] What? Don't call me "not pure of heart"! [off-screen] What about you with your crappy mullet? [on-screen] You're the one who's not pure of heart!

Sensei: (on-screen) That's it! I'm turning my back on you and counting to three, of death. And when I turn back around, (off-screen) you're toast! (on-screen) One of death. Two of death.

(A rip is heard. Rigby has ripped out "The Death Punch of Death.")

Sensei: NOOOOOOOOOOOO---

Death Kwon Do Student: Uhh...Sensei, uhh.., I think somebody just Death Kwon Clogged the toilet.

Sensei: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

("You're the Best Around" sung by Joe Esposito is heard during the montage. Rigby is trying to learn how to perform the "The Death Punch." Rigby fails, but learns how The Death Punch is used to have a mullet. He combs his hair into one, but still fails. He then learns you also have to wear cut jeans to perform it. He cuts the legs off of a pair of jeans and puts them on. He successfully performs The Death Punch by braking his and Mordecai's burrow. You're the Best Around fades away.)

Rigby: Whoa... Time to take this baby for a test drive.

(Rigby goes outside.)

Rigby: Huh-waaaaayyyyy! Hah! (targets Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost.)

Rigby: Heyy-yah! Heyy-yah! Heyyyyyyyyyy-yah! Hah! ("punches" Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost. Muscle Man hits the wall)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro...

(Rigby then targets Pops.)

Rigby: Heyy-yah! (punches Pops up to the sun)

(Rigby then targets Skips.)

Rigby: Heyyyy-yah! (punches Skips all the way a park light, leaving a rut.)

Rigby: Hah! Mmmeeeh!

(Rigby explodes the Snack Bar. Then the park fountain. Then a carnival tent. And finally, a rock.)

Rigby: Uhhhhh-aughhhhh! You're next, Mordecai!!

(Cut to the door of the bathroom. Mordecai comes out. A flush sound is heard.)

Mordecai: Do-do. Do-do. Do-do, do-do, do-do. All right, Rigby, cry baby time's over. Come on, let's go get some food. I'm buying.

(Mordecai notices Rigby's destruction of their room.)

Mordecai: Aw, what? Rigby! Aughhhhh! He's gonna pay for this. (Picks up the phone book.) Death Kwon Do?

Rigby: Where are you, Mordecai? I wanna play you punchies!

(Mordecai looks through the shades of his and Rigby's window.)

Rigby: Hey, mister, have you seen Mordecai?

Man 1: Uhhhh.., no. W-who's..(Rigby punches the Man.) Ughhhhhh!

Rigby: Have you seen him?

Man 2: Seen w-ughhhhh! (Rigby punches the second man.)

Rigby: How 'bout you?

(Punches the third man up on the window.)

Man 3: Ughhhh! Uhhhhhh........

Mordecai: Oh, so you think you're gonna beat me at punchies? Well, I've got news for you. I know your little secret.

(Cut to the park. The park is destroyed beyond repair.)

Dog 1: Rowr, rowr, rowr, rowr!

Dog 2: Uhmmm.

Rigby: Now massage this foot!

Skips: But I already did that one.

Rigby: Then rub it again! Unless you want to get punched again. And Pops, what's with the easy-breezy? Speed it up! My pepperonis are roasting down here!

Pops: Uhh-hmm!

Rigby: Muscle Man, you see Mordecai yet?

Muscle Man: Uhhh, I can't see anything. (he lowers the binoculars, revealing two black eyes)

Mordecai: I'm right here, Rigby.

Rigby: Gimme those!

(Notices Mordecai's attire. His hair is in a mullet and he is wearing jean shorts like Rigby.)

Rigby: Looks like you've learned the ways of Death Kwon Do.

Mordecai: Looks like you know how to say things people are already aware of.

Rigby: Whatever! You can't handle The Death Punch!

Mordecai: That sounds like a challenge.

Rigby: That's because maybe it IS a challenge!

Mordecai: Well then what're you doing up there?

Rigby: Muscle Man, Hi Fives, carry me down.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost carry Rigby down to Mordecai.)

Rigby: Don't drop me! Be careful! Woah, woah! Leaning, leaning! Here, here! Set me here. What move did you learn?

Mordecai: Why don't you come over here and find out.

Rigby: Hmm! Heyyyyyyyaaaaaahuhuhuh-hah!

(Rigby punches Mordecai.)

Rigby: What?

(Mordecai is not injured.)

Rigby: How come you're not dead yet?

Mordecai: Probably because I learned "The Death Block." (He holds up the page for it.) It worked pretty good for a first try, either that or your Death Punch totally blows.

Rigby: I'LL KILL YOU!!!! Yayhyhyhyhy!

Mordecai: Hmm-hmm. You're never gonna beat me at punchies.

Rigby: Nyaaaaahhhhh!

(Rigby repeatedly punches Mordecai, albeit failing, as the hole surrounding the two gets wider and deeper and Skips, Pops, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost watch the impact.)

Rigby: (panting)

Mordecai: Are you finished yet?

Rigby: Not until I smash you!!!!! Hyhaaw! (He punches Mordecai again and begins panting, but suddenly, a crack rips up the wall causing rock and soil to fly out, the lava starts to ooze out of the crack.)

Mordecai: Whoa.

Rigby: What? Are you afraid of a little lava? Hyayaaha! (Because of the punches, more cracks and lava occur.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is serious! We gotta get outta here!

Rigby: Never! Not until I beat you at punchies! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! (more lava spews)

Mordecai: Dude, stop! We're gonna die!

Rigby: I don't care!!! I'm sick of you always winning!!!!

(Mordecai has a realization about Rigby's statement. In the flashbacks, he first punches Rigby in his arm. And again. And again. Then on his side. Then on his back. And finally, in his crotch.)

Rigby: I'm not quitting 'till I win!!!

(Rigby continually punches Mordecai.)

Rigby: Heh-huh. Heh-huh. Heh-huh.

Mordecai: (faking) Aw! You got me, you got me! Aw, you got me! You win! We have to stop now 'cause I lost.

Rigby: Hah! I told ya I was gonna win! In yo face! Yay-hay-hay! I finally get to be player one!

Mordecai: What?! That's what this is about?! You just wanted to be player one?!

Rigby: Huh! That's all I ever wanted!

Mordecai: Dude, you can totally be player one.

Rigby: (sobs)

Mordecai: Dude, quit crying. I said you could be player one.

Rigby: I know, but what good is being player one now? We're just gonna die in this lava!!!

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. I can get us away from the lava.

Rigby: Really? How?

Mordecai: You think I'm dumb enough to steal only one Death Kwon Do move?

Rigby: Wha-?

Mordecai: Now, how do you wanna get outta here? "The Death Jump" or "The Death Dump"?

Rigby: Aw, sick!!! Better go with the Death Jump.

Mordecai: Hold on tight.

(Mordecai flies up to the sky holding Rigby.)

Pops: Look!

Sensei: Why, yes sir, I have the Death Jump, and the Death Dump right he-- (opens the notebook... only to find both the Death Jump and Death Dump pages ripped out, courtesy of Mordecai) NOOOOOOOOOO--

Announcer on game: Da-da-da-da-da--Dig Champs!

Rigby: Aw, yes! It's finally happening!

Mordecai: Yep. For once being a huge baby actually worked out for you.

Rigby: Stop talking!!!!!!!!

Mordecai: Hah-ha-hah. Dude, just hurry up and play. You're just gonna die right at the beginning anyway.

Rigby: Mah-mah-mah-mah-mah-mah. Unn. I'll show you.

(Rigby plays the game. He is killed by a snail.)

Rigby: Aw, what? Snails are bad? I thought snails were good!

Mordecai: No, dude, snails are bad.

Rigby: Aw, man. This sucks... I wanna be player two.

(Episode begin with a car parking up at the Park. It appears to be Benson's car. Mordecai is the one behind it as he turns it off. He and Rigby come out. Mordecai has pizza in hand while Rigby has the keys in hand. They sing Deez Keys as they approach the second dome. At the end, Rigby twirls the keys and they fly off his finger.)

Rigby: Whoops!

(Margaret's Apartment, exterior, day. Mordecai and Rigby are walking in.)

Rigby: Dude, let's water them later.

Mordecai: No! We're watering Margaret's plants now!

(continue into the inside. Mordecai & Rigby continue to walk into Margaret's room.)

Rigby: Ugh! You're so whipped. (Mordecai & Rigby stop walking for a moment.)

Mordecai: No, I'm not.

Rigby: Yeah right! You're whipped with a capital... (raises arm and makes whip noise)

Mordecai: Just help me water the plants! (Mordecai inserts the key into the hole of Margaret's door, and then, we cut to the inside of Margaret's room as he opens the door) Whoa! (pan over to the right to show the rest of the place) This place is awesome! (walks into the apartment, and then, pulls the blinds to see a propane grill on the balcony) Aw, yeah! Grill! (to Rigby) After we start dating, I'll totally invite you over for burgers.

Rigby: Whatever! Can we just get this over with so we can leave?

Mordecai: Chill, dude! (walks over to a bookshelf. He then grabs a picture frame. In it, we see Margaret and Eileen in the desert) I can't believe Margaret asked us to water her plants while she's gone for the weekend. I think this really shows a level of trust.

Rigby: I think you're reading too much into it. All she did was ask you to water her plants.

Mordecai: (walking into kitchen) Yeah, well, I don't see anyone asking you to water their plants. (opens cabinet)

Rigby: Man, she's got a lot of plants!

(Mordecai opens another cabinet.)

Rigby: I can't believe you told her you'd water all these. What a chump.

Mordecai: It's because Margaret's my friend.

Rigby: (scoffs) Yeah, your friend without benefits.

Mordecai: Hey, shut up and help me find the watering can.

(Rigby groans as we go into a montage of M&R looking for the can. First, Mordecai opens a cabinet, but then closes it when he sees no can. Next, Rigby walks past the bathroom, seeing no can. Then, Mordecai looks into the closet for the can, and then closes it. Last, Rigby tries to open the bedroom door, but finds it locked. On the door, there is a red hat.)

Rigby: Agh, the bedroom door's locked! (grabs hat)

Mordecai: It wouldn't be in her bedroom! Stay out of there!

Rigby: (wearing the hat) Oh, Mordecai, he's alright. (leans against fridge) Besides, it's not like we're dating or anything. I just let them come over and water my plants sometimes.

Mordecai: Hey, put that back!

Rigby: No. I wanna wear it while I water the plants.

Mordecai: Put it back!

Rigby: Make me. (Mordecai shoves Rigby in an attempt to knock the hat off of him. The fight goes on for a few seconds as Rigby yells) Get off of me! I wanna wear it while I water the plants!

(Rigby goes headfirst into a bookshelf, knocking down a diary from the bookshelf and ripping the lock.)

Mordecai: Dude, what did you do?! (He picks up the book.)

Rigby: What do you mean, what did I do?! You pushed me!

Mordecai: Dude, you broke it!

Rigby: Yeah right, you can't break books! And besides, even if it did break, just put it back and don't say anything!

Mordecai: Dude, you totally broke it! Look, this thing has a lock on it. (close up on the broken lock. Mordecai flips it back)

Rigby: What? What kind of book has a lock on it?

Mordecai: I don't know. (From Mordecai's point of view, we see the opening page. The top reads, in courier text, "THIS DIARY BELONGS TO," and, on the bottom, we see Margaret's name in underlined italics)

Mordecai: Oh no. (closes diary)

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: This is Margaret's diary! Dude, she's gonna think I was reading her diary! (leans against wall) This is bad.

Rigby: Dude, what's the big deal? It's just some lame old diary. I mean, why do people even need to keep secrets? I don't have any secrets. Do you have any secrets? I know I sure don't.

Mordecai: I don't care! If she comes home and finds this thing broken, she's gonna think I read it! We have to fix it before she gets back.

(Skips to next scene; Mordecai puts the broken lock back to place)

Mordecai: Come on, come on. (The lock falls off) Agh.

Rigby: Will you chill out? It's not gonna stick without glue. (Gets up from the couch) Agh, looks like Rigby has to bail you out again. (Goes into the kichen and looks through one of the cabinets and he finds "Supe the Glup") Aw yeah, "Supe the Glup."

Mordecai: Dude, just a drop.

Rigby: I know.

Mordecai: Just a drop.

Rigby: I know! (He squirts a lot of glue on the diary)

Mordecai: (Pushes Rigby) Dude, I said "Just a drop!"

Rigby: You were making me nervous!

Mordecai: (Takes out a tissue and tries to use it to wipe off the glue, but it rips) Aw, man! (Swipes the glue out of Rigby's hands) Let me see that glue. Ok, ok, ok. It says here we can remove the glue with heat.

Rigby: Let me handle it.

(Mordecai and Rigby head to the kitchen, and put the diary in the microwave, but Mordecai pushes Rigby before he can push start)

Mordecai: Wait. (Mordecai now rethinks what happened the last time they put random stuff in the microwave; which was during the events of "It's Time") We're not putting anything in the microwave. (Now it skips to the balcony, where Mordecai turns on the grill to heat up the glue, and it starts to drip)

Rigby: Dude, it's working.

Mordecai: Yeah it is. (The glue drips on the fire, and explodes, which leaves the diary on fire. Mordecai is shocked and gets a towel to put the fire out. Then Rigby comes out with lighter fluid)

Rigby: I got it. I got it.

Mordecai: Dude, that's not--!

(Rigby squirts the fluid on the diary, and now made it look worse. Mordecai then uses a fire extinguisher to cool the diary off. Mordecai and Rigby then rush to the bathroom and throw the diary in the toilet.)

Rigby: You think she'll notice?

(Skips to the park at Skips's house)

Mordecai: Can you fix it?

Skips: What is this?

Mordecai: It's Margaret's diary.

Skips: Why does it look like that?

Rigby: It's a long story.

Skips: (Picks up the diary, and takes a good look at it) Oh, hmmm.... Sorry, this can't be fixed with any traditional methods.

Mordecai: Ugh. Well do you have any un-traditional ones?

Skips: Of course. There is one way, I could transfer it to a new diary using a magic quill pen.

Mordecai: Thank you Skips.

Skips: In order for this to work, we have to be in the same place where the diary was broken.

Rigby: Margaret's house.

Skips: But first I want you both to know is that diaries are a serious business, cause they can contain secrets. And secrets must be protected at all cost.

Rigby: Yeah Skips we know.

Skips: Do you? (pause) Look, out of respect for Margaret's secrets, I'm gonna help you guys. But, you have to take it seriously and do exactly as I say.

Mordecai: Yeah, Skips, we promise.

Rigby: Yeah, we promise.

Skips: Well you better, because secrets are a force to be reckoned with.

(We now go back to Margaret's apartment, Skips places Margaret's diary and a different journal on the table)

Rigby: Ah, what?! That doesn't look anything like Margaret's diary.

Skips: As in written content, so too in physical appearance, will the books become identical. Alright, guys, join hands.

(Everyone joins hands except for Rigby.)

Rigby: I'm not gonna hold hands!

Mordecai: C'mon, dude, just do it, he's trying to help us out.

Rigby: Ugh! Fine.

Skips: Okay, it's time to begin. Now, no matter what ya hear, you mustn't look at Margaret's thoughts as the quill transfers the secrets. (Skips opens the box with the quill inside it, a strong wind blows through as the quill levitates. Mordecai and Rigby are stunned)

Skips: Now we must all close our eyes.

(Everyone except Rigby does)

Skips: Rigby, close your eyes.

Rigby: Fine, I'm closin' em. (He closes his eyes, since it is Rigby's POV, we have an immediate blackout)

Skips: (VO) Begin. (Ghoulish whispers begin to fill the room)

Rigby: (VO) What're they saying?

Skips: (VO) Just keep your eyes closed and ignore them.

(There is a pause, more whispers, then:)

Mordecai: (VO) HOW MUCH LONGER IS THIS GONNA TAKE?!

Skips:  (VO) It should be any minute, just keep your eyes closed!

(Rigby opens his eyes, Margaret's secrets, taking the appearance of ghosts, are floating around in a black room. It appears as if Skips and Mordecai are barely hanging on to each other)

Rigby: Cool.

(The quill and the books turn into Margaret's face, it screams at Rigby)

Rigby: AHH!

(The room morphs into Margaret's apartment, the table falls on the floor)

(Skips opens his eyes, surprised)

Skips: The transfer is incomplete. Did everyone keep their eyes shut?

Mordecai: I kept mine shut!

(They look at Rigby)

Rigby: What?!

(They keep looking)

Rigby: Alright, fine! There's a chance I might've maybe probably looked. Maybe.

Skips: RIGBY! Do you have any idea what you've done?!

(There is screaming and stomping outside)

Rigby: What is that?

Mordecai: It's coming from outside.

(They go on the patio)

Rigby: Woah!  
(We see a giant, flaming Margaret in a warrior's dress. People are running from it)

Mordecai: Margaret?!

Skips: That's not Margaret. When Rigby looked--

Rigby: I SAID MAYBE LOOKED, MAYBE!

Skips: He released the Guardian of Margaret's Secrets.

(The Guardian stomps towards Margaret's apartment)

Skips: She will destroy us for looking at her secrets.

Rigby: What do we do?!

Skips: There's only one way to stop this. Each of us must reveal a secret of our own, or she'll destroy us.

(She keeps advancing)

Skips: Alright. I'll go first. The reason I always skip is, in all my life, my heart yearned for only one woman. And we used to skip together all the time. On the day I lost her, I vowed to skip every day for the rest of my life, so that I'd never forget the time we spent together.

(Her fire goes out for a second, then it restarts)

Skips: I-IT'S WORKIN'! NOW TELL YOUR SECRETS!

Mordecai: Uh, okay, uh, sometimes, when we're supposed to be cleaning out gutters, we go to get coffee instead!

Rigby: Yeah, yeah, good one! And a lot of times, I don't even get coffee! I just don't feel like cleaning out the gutters!

(She still advances)

Skips: No, it has to be something meaningful!

(She raises her fist, they scream as she destroys the patio)

Rigby: HOW MEANINGFUL DOES IT HAVE TO BE?!

(The apartment shakes, as Rigby screams, the Guardian reaches for the roof)

Skips: UNLESS YOU TELL A REAL SECRET, WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

Mordecai: ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT! I LIKE TO SING ALONG TO REALLY BAD POP MUSIC!

(She rips off part of the roof)

Rigby: I ATE A DOUGHNUT OUTTA THE TRASH!

(The Guardian, who is holding a street lamp, is unaffected)

Mordecai: I LIKE GOING COMMANDO! A LOT!

Rigby: I ACTUALLY LIKE THE TASTE OF DOUGHNUTS BETTER WHEN THEY'RE FROM THE TRASH!

(She throws the lamp, which hits the right-hand-side couch, Mordecai dives to the left one)

Mordecai: RIGBY! REMEMBER WHEN WE ORDERED BEDS FOR OUR ROOM AND YOUR'S NEVER SHOWED UP?! I LIED! I STACKED THEM UP AND I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON THEM THE WHOLE TIME! I'M SORRY, DUDE, IT'S JUST TOO COMFORTABLE!

Rigby: Are you serious?

(Her flames go out and restart, she walks away and gets a bus)

Mordecai: RIGBY! SAY SOMETHING!

Rigby: AHH! WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I STOLE MY NEIGHBOR'S BIKE AND THREW IT OFF THE ROOF!

(She's about to throw the bus)

Skips: IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING DEEP!

Rigby: SOMETIMES I HIDE POPS' SHOES CAUSE I THINK IT'S FUNNY WHEN HE'S LOOKING FOR THEM! I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON! I HATE TAKING SHOWERS AND I HATE KITTENS! I LIED ABOUT BEING ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM! I THINK EILEEN IS HOT WITHOUT HER GLASSES ON!

(She disappears and the damage is repaired)

Skips: Let's finish this!

(Margaret's secrets go in as the book turns into Margaret's diary)

Mordecai: Woah, it looks exactly like Margaret's! Skips, how can we repay you?

Skips: You remember that stuff I said about why I skip?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Skips: No ya don't.

(Skips walks out as Mordecai puts her diary back)

Rigby: I knew it was my mattress.

Mordecai: So, Eileen, huh?

Rigby: STOP TALKING!

(Clock transition to the coffee shop)

Mordecai: I can't believe we got the diary back together.

Rigby: Yeah, what a pain. I never wanna water Margaret's plants ever again.

Mordecai: Wait, did we actually ever water her plants?

Rigby: Here she comes!

Mordecai: Ha, ha! Oh, hey Margaret! How was your trip?

Margaret: It was nice, but i can only take my parents for so long, you know?

Rigby: Tell me about it, 'rents are the worst.

Mordecai: Well, you don't have to worry about your plants, or if the roof is still on your apartment, or whatever. Because it's fine is what I meant. (nervous chuckle)

Margaret: Oh. You guys didn't go and water them, did you?

Mordecai: Yeah, why?

Margaret: I forgot that I already asked Eileen to do it.

Mordecai: Really?

Margaret: Yeah, she had the spare bedroom all weekend. Sorry you guys went through all that trouble.

Mordecai: I guess we just missed each other, so don't worry about it.

Rigby: Yeah, it's cool.

Eileen: Hey, guys, here's your coffee.

(Eileen comes up without her glasses and crashes into the table, the episode ends)

(Episode starts with Benson and Skips in Mr. Maellard's office)

Benson: It's always good to have you at the park, Mr. Maellard, sir.

Mr. Maellard: (turns to face Benson & Skips) Don't try to fraternize with me, Bert.

Benson: Actually, sir, my name is Benson.

Mr. Maellard: I know what your name is, Beanbag! So, everything is ready for the unveiling of the new statue today, right, Beanbag?

Benson: Yes, sir. The catering's all set up, and the sound system is in place...

Mr. Maellard: Good. Great. Only one thing missing. My son! (shows portrait of Pops) Pops! When I told him he had to give a speech today, he ran away, crying. I didn't invite all my friends and waste a lot of money for nothing! Right, Beanteen?

Benson: Uh, no, sir.

Mr. Maellard: Now you go find Pops so he can give his speech, or you're fired! Underline, FIRED!!!

(cut to seconds later, with the door slamming)

Skips: So, what do we do first?

Benson: Find Pops, and make sure Mordecai and Rigby don't mess this up.

(clock transition to the swingset. Pops is sitting on one of the swings, sobbing, as Mordecai and Rigby walk up)

Mordecai: Hey Pops, is everything okay?

Pops: No. My father wants me to give a speech in front of all his friends today. But I can't, because I'm a no-good turkey and I'm going to strawberry jam the whole thing up! (M&R look at each other)

Rigby: What are you saying?

Pops: I'm just saying, I can't... I don't know why, I just get terribly anxious when I give speeches...

Rigby: I give speeches all the time. It's easy.

Mordecai: When do you ever give speeches?

Rigby: What? It's like, just, talking in front of a bunch of people. We talk in front of each other all the time.

Mordecai: Actually, yeah. We do do that. (to Pops) See, Pops? We can totally help you get over your nerves.

Pops: Oh, thank you!

(clock transition to another part of the park, next to a lamppost covered with notes)

Mordecai: Okay, Pops. I want you to pretend there's a crowd of people here. But, they're all your family and friends. You know, people who it's easy for you to talk to. (backs away) And... go!

Pops: Oh! Uh... (pulls out notecard from his vest) I need my notes. Let's see. Umm... (notices the emptiness) Where did everyone go? They must have hated my speech.

Mordecai: No, Pops. Just pretend there are people there.

Pops: (turns to emptiness, then back to M&R) I'm not very good at pretending.

Rigby: I got this. (goes to lamppost to grab a band for hire ad and puts it over Pop's eyes) Here. Pretend these dudes are your friends and family in the crowd.

Pops: Where did these people come from?

Rigby: Okay, Pops. Give it a shot. (turns Pops to the right)

Pops: Okay, um... (pause) NO! NO! Get away! (starts running around. The ad shakes as he moves) STOP FOLLOWING ME! (runs into lamppost)

Mordecai: Maybe we should just find you some real people to practice on.

(mini-montage of Pops struggling to give his speech in front of people at a baseball stadium, concert hall, movie theater, restaurant, hospital and job interview. Cut to the park where Pops is still sobbing.)

Mordecai: Okay. Obviously, this isn't working.

Rigby: I guess Pops will just never be able to give his speech, you know what I'm saying? (Mordecai punches Rigby) Owww... How you holding up there, Pops?

Pops: Oh, I just don't think I can do it.

Mordecai: Hey, I know. Why don't you just picture everybody naked?

Pops: Naked?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Pops: Okay... (looks at Mordecai & Rigby to see that they are already naked) I don't like doing this...

Rigby: Ugh. I don't know, why don't you just spin around and get dizzy or something?

Mordecai: What? How's that gonna do anything?

Rigby: It makes more sense than looking at naked people. (to Pops) Pops, what would you rather do? Spin around and get dizzy, or look at naked people?

Pops: Get dizzy.

Rigby: Hmph. Hmhmph. Hmhmph. Why don't you give it a try, Pops?

Pops: (slowly) Okay. (MR&P stand up)

Mordecai: Ready?

Pops: Uh-huh.

Mordecai: Now spin! (Pops starts spinning faster and faster)

Pops: Oh, yes!

Mordecai: Is it working?

Pops: (the world around him becomes warped as he laughs) Oh my, it's true! (sees blurry Mordecai & Rigby) I'm not nervous anymore! (laughs) It's working, it's working! (cut to the job interview, hospital, restaurant, movie theater, concert hall and baseball field, in that order, before we cut back to the park) I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! (laughs) I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna give the best speech I've ever given!

(cut to another part of the park. Benson and Skips run up to each other)

Benson: I can't find Pops. Did you see him?

Skips: No. I checked everywhere. (Muscle Man is seen mowing the lawn in the distance)

Benson: Muscle Man, have you seen Pops at all today?

Muscle Man: Yeah. And you know who else has seen Pops today?

Benson: Who, your mom?

Muscle Man: I wasn't gonna say that. Why does everyone always think I'm gonna say "my mom"? I saw Pops earlier by the playground, with those two losers.

Benson: Oh, great. Mordecai and Rigby found him first.

Skips: We better find him, quick.

(cut to where Mordecai Rigby & Pops are. Pops is still spinning around)

Mordecai and Rigby: Okay Pops, you can stop now.

Pops: But I have to keep spinning until I give my speech. Did I tell you I'm not nervous anymore?

Mordecai: Yeah, you did.

Rigby: A bunch of times, actually.

Pops: Isn't it wonderful? I think I'm finally ready. (Pops starts to get dizzy)

Mordecai and Rigby: Careful, Pops!

(Pops stumbles as he stops spinning, eventually falling into a portal in the ground. Pops screams as he falls through the green void. The background changes from radar circles, to kaleidoscopic blue shapes, and finally, white with black lines. Pops' mustache disintegrates, then, he's stripped naked from the gravity around him. He stops screaming for a moment as he realizes it's just a white void, but resumes screaming when the gravity comes back in. He then falls into a pink pool that leads to a land down below. His clothes and mustache are restored as his hat falls onto his head. In the distance, he sees other creatures dressed like him, one of them, a goldfish that comes up and scares Pops. Back on the surface world, Mordecai & Rigby look upon the knocked-out Pops)

Rigby: Is he dead? (Pops moans)

Mordecai: Oh, dude. He must have passed out from spinning too much.

Rigby: (pulls out marker) Never pass out, when there's markers about!

Mordecai: Dude, this isn't some sleepover, this is serious! (Mordecai & Rigby go down to Pops and flip him over. Pops moans again) Oh, man. I'm gonna get help. (runs off) You stay with Pops!

(ripple transition into Pops' unconscious world. They have all surrounded him. From the distance, realistic-looking versions of Mordecai and Rigby, Iacedrom and Ygbir, arrive.)

Pops: (Feeling scared) Oh, my!

Iacedrom: (squawks at Pops, and then coughs) Sorry about that. I am Iacedrom.

Ygbir: And I, Ygbir. (takes off hat to reveal ice cream)

Iacedrom: Would you like some ice cream?

Pops: Oh yes, of course!

Iacedrom: So what brings you here, traveller?

Pops: Hmm? Well, I was just getting over my fear of giving speeches. (the crowd voices in their opinion)

Iacedrom: Indeed. We all hate speeches! In fact, we outlawed them.

Ygbir: Yes, yes. Quite illegal. In here, it is forbidden to give speeches just as it is forbidden not to enjoy ice cream.

Pops: Oh, what a relief!

Iacedrom and Ygbir: Good show!

Pops: Jolly good show indeed!

(cut to the surface world. Rigby is already defacing Pops with the marker. He snickers as Mordecai, Benson and Skips drive up with the cart)

Benson: Oh no, what are you doing?! Get away from him! (looks at Pops' drawn-on face) Rigby!

Rigby: Sorry, it's a nervous habit. You guys were taking forever.

Benson: This is a disaster! Look at him! (Mordecai & Rigby snicker) It's not funny! (to Skips) Skips, what do we do?

Skips: (puts his head against Pops) You shouldn't have made him spin like that. (goes to the cart and grabs a red box) You're gonna have to go in after him.

Rigby: Go in where?

Skips: Into Pops. (Mordecai & Rigby look at each other, and grab hold of each other's hands)

Rigby: Make this quick. I don't want people to think we're holding hands or something.

Mordecai: Just spin.

(Mordecai & Rigby start spinning around in circles, while Skips flexes the rope. As they get dizzy, Skips starts to lasso the rope. Finally, Mordecai & Rigby let go)

Mordecai: (dizzy) Don't worry Pops, we're coming...

(Skips throws the rope around Mordecai and Rigby before they fall into Pops' head. They scream as they fall through the void before falling into the pink pool that leads into the Dizzy World. Mordecai & Rigby see Pops in front of Iacedrom & Ygbir and the other citizens of the Dizzy world)

Rigby: Look, there's Pops!

Mordecai: Pops, Pops!

(Pops hears them and looks up at them)

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, hello!

Mordecai: Pops, we have come to bring you back!

Pops: But I don't want to come back. I like it here.

Mordecai: But what about your speech?

Pops: I don't want to give the speech.

Rigby: But we spent all that time preparing! Are you just gonna blow it off now?

Pops: Yes.

Mordecai: This is ridiculous! Come on Pops, let's go! You're coming back with us!

Pops: (acts immature and turns the other way, crossing his arms) No, I'm not!

Mordecai: (sternly) Pops, let's go.

Pops: (angry) I said no! (silence for a second)...Now listen here, I have gone through enough turmoil because of that confounded speech. Why is it me that needs to speak? Surely, there are those more qualified than I. I hate speaking in front of crowds. And we have tried every which way for it to work, but I just simply cannot do it. Why am I like this? I don't know, but surely my father must understand that there are limits to my abilities. I'll never ever be able to give a speech, and that's just fine by me.

(Mordecai & Rigby look at each other, surprised)

Mordecai: Never say never, Pops!

Pops: What do you mean?

Mordecai: You just gave a speech!

Pops: (startled, and turns to the crowd) Oh my, I did! (turns back to Mordecai & Rigby) I did give a speech!

Rigby: Yeah! I guess you didn't get nervous because you were not facing the crowd!

Pops: It's true, I didn't feel nervous at all. (Runs up to Iacedrom & Ygbir) Friends, I'm sorry, but I have to leave you now. (dramatic music ensues)

Iacedrom: Indeed. You do have to leave, for you have broken the law!

Ygbir: No speeches! (Iacedrom & Ygbir hiss and squawk, scaring Pops. Then, Iacedrom lunges his beak towards Pops, but Pops runs for cover. Ygbir also tries to catch Pops within his teeth)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops!

Mordecai: (to Skips, in the real world) Skips, drop us lower! (Skips lowers the rope, and his arm, into the unconcious Pops) More, Skips!

Skips: That's all we got.

(Ygbir corners Pops as he tries to run away, so Pops tries to run in the opposite direction, before being blocked off by Iacedrom, who picks up Pops by the head with his beak, then, throws him over go of him into Mordecai & Rigby, Are still holding the rope)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops!

Mordecai: (to Skips) Skips, pull us up!

(the rope is pulled back into the skies of the Dizzy World, just as Iacedrom flies towards Mordecai, Rigby, & Pops. The three then make it into the pink void, causing Iacedrom to hit his head on the matter. In the real world, Mordecai & Rigby are pulled back in through Pops' head. When they are out, Pops comes to, wondering what happened.) 

Benson: Pops, you're awake!

Pops: Benson, my good man. Pardon me, I just came back from that strange and wonderful place.

Benson: Okay, sure, but can you still give the speech?

Pops: Oh yes, I am finally prepared.

Benson: Thank goodness. We just have to get this trash off his face.

Mordecai: Nah, it's cool. Pops is gonna give his speech facing backwards anyway so...

Benson: What? You idiots! This isn't some kind of joke! He can't give a major speech in front of a distinguished crowd facing backwards. If Mr. Maellard sees this, we're all gonna get fired.

Mordecai: (to Rigby) Give me the marker. (Rigby gives the marker to Mordecai) Turn around, Pops.

(Mordecai turns Pops around so the back of his head shows, then, draws a face, similar to Pops', on his head. Then, Skips puts the hat on. Everyone but Benson seems satisfied)

Benson: We're dead.

(clock transition to the ceremony, some time later. Pops is at the podium. His still-trashed side pulls out the card with his speech as Mordecai & Rigby nod. Then, Pops gives his speech)

Pops: Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen, I hereby dedicate this new statue to the Park.

(The crowd claps)

Gentlemen: Bravo. Bravo.

Mordecai and Rigby: That's the whole speech?

Gentleman: You've got a fine boy there, Maellard.

(Pops, his real face hidden away from the crowd, struggles to cut the rope, but, after a few tries, he finally does. Cut to the food stands. The groundskeepers reflect on what went on)

Rigby: That went pretty well.

Benson: Are you kidding?!

Mordecai: You can't fire me. I thought of the marker thing.

Rigby: Yeah. We totally saved you this time, Benson.

Benson: (growls) Quick! Maellard's coming!

(Turns Pops around as Mr. Maellard walks up to him for a congratulation)

Mr. Maellard: Son, you gave a fine speech up there. I'm so... proud of you.

Pops: Oh! Thank you, papa! (Is seen crying on his defaced side) Thank you.

Mr. Maellard: You pulled it together out there today, Ball bucket. Good job. (walks away)

Benson: Thank you, sir. It was.... no trouble.

Mordecai and Rigby: What was that?

Mordecai: We're the ones that found Pops.

Benson: And sent him into shock and desecrated his face! (sighs) Let's go clean you up, Pops. (He, Pops, and Skips leave)

Mordecai: This party sucks.

Rigby: You wanna go back to that Dizzy World?

Mordecai: Yes.

(Mordecai and Rigby start to spin, but we never get to see them pass out, as the screen cuts to black before then.)

(The episode starts showing Wing Kingdom. We hear the gang laughing and a plate of wings and sauce come in. Everybody grabs a wing and dunks it in the sauce. We see Mordecai and Rigby laughing, then we see Muscle Man, High-Five Ghost and Thomas.)

Muscle Man: And he was all like, BOOM!

(Muscle Man makes an explosion hand movement. Muscle Man, High-Five Ghost, and Thomas laugh.)

Benson: Hey! (eats a wing with sauce and laughs) Listen up, everybody, stop talking! (Benson shushes everybody while everybody lays their eyes on Benson.) Look, I just want to thank everybody for training so hard, we're doing a real good job. And I think we're in great shape for the dodgeball tournament tomorrow.

Muscle Man: I'll say. As long as Mordecai keeps throwing them spheres.

(Pretends to do the move he was talking about Mordecai doing.)

Mordecai: Ahhhhhhhhhh....... Nahhhhhh............

(Everybody Else): YEAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

Thomas: Yeah, man, that spin move you were doing was crazy.

(Twirls his finger in a circle.)

Mordecai: Oh yeah, the Tornado.

Rigby: Yeah! The Tornado! Where'd you learn that? You were like WHAM! (Shows a movement of the Tornado.)

Hi Five Ghost: Ha ha. It is crazy fast.

Muscle Man: One of those Tornados flew by my head, and it was all like,(makes fast wind-swishing sounds. Everybody else laughs hard.) It's true.

Benson: Alright, everybody, just simmer down now. We've all been playing great, alright? (Everybody else chatters.) But, if I had to be totally honest here, we could all stand to learn a little something, from, this guy right here. (Touches Mordecai and whispers.) I think you're better than all of these guys here. (eats a wing and twirls his finger)

Mordecai: (chuckles) Thanks, man.

Skips: Hey, take it easy on those wings, Benson. You might still have a concussion from practice.

Benson: No, you're right, you're right. But you know what? I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. I think we have a really good shot of winning the tournament this year. (stands up) Sure we haven't won this thing in 10 years. But this is our year! Benson's Ballerz are gonna win this! So who's with me?!

Everyone else: Yeah!

Benson: I'm sorry, did you guys just say "Yeah?"

Everyone else: YEAH!

Benson: Alright, then! Let's do this!

(Scene cuts to the dodgeball arena, where people are training for the tournament. We pan over to Benson's Ballerz.)

Mordecai: Alright, dude. You figure out hoe to throw the right way this time?

Rigby: (holding a dodgeball) Hmm! Hmm! I got this! Rignado! (spins) Hee-yah! (throws the dodgeball, and it hits the referee)

Referee: Ooohhh! (falls)

Rigby: Oooohh!

Mordecai: Uhh, still needs work. (runs off)

Benson: (approaching Rigby) Rigby! No, no. No tornado.

(We see Mordecai picking up a dodgeball, when another flies into view.)

???: Hey! A little help?

(Mordecai picks up the other dodgeball and throws it back. It's revealed that CJ is the one who threw the ball, and is standing with wide open arms. Her smile fades as the two look at each other, and the dodgeball hits her. Mordecai screams.)

Mordecai: Ooooh! (turns around and runs off)

Thunder Girl Member: Hey, CJ! Come on!

(Mordecai continues running to the door as Rigby throws a ball at him.)

Rigby: You're out! (watches Mordecai run through the door. Mordecai sighs in the hallway) Dude, what's your deal?

Mordecai: CJ is here.

Rigby: Are you guys gonna make out and run away from each other again?

Mordecai: Dude, quit it! I haven't seen her since we kissed on New Year's Eve and I feel weird around her. Like she still hates me for the whole movie mix-up with Margaret.

Rigby: Then just go talk to her about it.

Mordecai: No! Ugh, man. I'm not gonna be able to focus with her here. What if she distracts me and I mess up?

Rigby: Dude, whatever. Her team is new. They'll probably get eliminated in like, 2 seconds.

Mordecai: Yeah, I guess I'll just try to avoid her.

Benson: (comes through the door) Come on, you two! The game's about to start. (smiles and points) Benson's Ballerz needs their star player.

(Cut to Mordecai on the dodgeball court. Benson's Ballerz is on the left side, while East Pines is on the right.)

Referee: Alright, dodgeballers! If you get hit, cross the center line, or an opposing player catches your ball, you're out! First place goes to the last team standing. On your mark, get set, dodgeball!

(Benson's Balllerz defeat East Pines and move on to the second round, along with Blitz Bombs who had defeated Last Picks. The Magical Elements are up against an unknown team, and the emerge victorious. Thanks to Thomas, Benson's Ballerz defeat Blitz Bombs and move on to the third round along with Death Kwon Dodge. CJ's team, The Thunder Girls, defeat the coffee team and make it to the semi-final. along with Duke Dodgers. Mordecai uses his Tornado technique to defeat Sensai of Death Kwon Dodge, allowing his team to move on to the semi-final, along with none other than the Magical Elements. As their team starts to lose players, Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Skips huddle up.)

Rigby: We don't stand a chance against these guys. They're using magic!

Benson: You're right. Line up behind Skips! (The Guardians of Eternal Youth have their magical dodgeballs ready) Skips, you gotta catch these. We got your back!

(The dodgeballs are thrown and Skips catches them as they turn red. Benson and Skips throw them, knocking out the God of Basketball and a wizard player. Mordecai knocks out Death, and soon, it's down to one Guardian and Gary.)

Benson: Finish this, Mordecai!

(Mordecai is about to throw, when...)

CJ: (to her teamates) ...and then I was like, "No, its cause we want that huge trophy! (laughs with the team)

(Gary throws the ball at Mordecai face, eliminating him.)

Benson: NOOOO!

Gary: Well, Benson, looks like your star player just burnt out. (makes a hissing sound)

(Benson, in a fit of rage, juimps and throws the ball directly at Gary's face.)

Benson: Yeah! (gets knocked out by Reginald)

Rigby:  (catches the dodgeball) Hey, I caught it!

(Reginald throws another ball, knocking out Skips but missing Rigby, who is now the only one left.)

Benson: No. No. No!

(Rigby trembles while Reggie laughs)

Reginald: Well, let's get this over with.

(In slow motion, Rigby uses his Rignado and knock out the remaining Guardian.)

Referee: You're out!

Reginald: Nooooo! (uses magic on the audience, who run aside.)

Ballerz: OOOOOOOHHHH! (run to Rigby)

Benson: I'm sorry I doubted you, man. (to Mordecai) Mordecai, what happened out there?

Mordecai: Uhh....

Rigby: This girl that hates Mordecai is here and it's messin' up his game. (gets punched by Mordecai)

Benson: (not surprised) Mordecai, why didn't you say so?

Mordecai: It's complicated, okay?

Hi Five Ghost: (goes to the team bracket) Hey, we're playing the girls in the final game: The Thunder Girls

(We are shown Benson's Ballerz vs The Thunder Girls in the final.)

Mordecai: What?! (watches the team go on the court) Aaaugh! We're playing CJ's team? (puts his head in his hands) Aw, man. I can't do this. I can't do this!

Benson: (walks up tto Mordecai) Hey, hey. The only thing we can't do is lose! We already beat The Magical Elements! We've come too far to back down now. TOO FAR!

(Cut to the final game underway.)

Referee: On your mark get set, dodgeball!

(The two teams grab their dodgeballs and start throwing. One by one, each team member starts getting eliminated.)

Benson: (on sidelines with Fives, Muscle Man, Thomas, Pops and Skips) Ugh! We're dropping like flies!

Thunder Girl Member #2: Ugh! They're crushing us!

(Mordecai and CJ are the only players left. They both have worried looks on their faces.)

Benson: What is he doing?!

(Mordecai makes the first throw, which CJ dodges. She makes her throw, and Mordecai dodges as well. They both frantically start grabbing and throwing dodgeeballs and each other and dodging.)

Benson: Aaah! I can't take this! Finish her, Mordecai! Finish her so we can win this!

(Mordecai looks back at CJ.)

Benson: (in slow motion and rage) Finish her!

Thunder Girls: (in slow motion) Finish him!

(Mordecai starts running up with a dodgeball, and CJ does the same. They both spin and throw their dodgeballs at each other, and they both colide with great force and richochet back at the respective dodgeballers, causing them to disappear in midair. The scene moves to a dark area, where Mordecai and CJ reappear and plunder. They both get up and find themselves in a dark realm, where 5 people are looking at them.)

CJ: What is this place?

(They watch a replay of themselves in the final round.)

IDC #1: Mordecai and CJ, you have been summoned before the IDC.

Mordecai: The what?

IDC #2: The Intergalactic Dodgeball Councl, duh!

IDC #3: The reason that you're here is because you've reached an infinite standoff. And we believe that you're unable to knock each out because you've avoiding your history together.

CJ: What?! We're not avoiding our history together. (at Mordecai) I mean, like...

Mordecai: Yeah. We don't even have a history together. Well, you know what I mean, right?

CJ: (nods) Oh, yeah. We don't even...have a history...together.

IDC #4: You're dodging the facts.

IDC #2: Yes. Why are you dodging?

(Mordecai and CJ look at each other.)

IDC #3: Let us then view a replay of your history together.

(He forms three magic balls and floats them up. The first one is shown with a scene from Yes Dude Yes.)

CJ: (in scene) Oh, gross. How old are you? (she and Mordecai laugh)

(A second scene from Yes Dude Yes is shown.)

Mordecai: (in scene) But it's true!

CJ: (in scene) I can't believe this! Are you just playing? (turns into a cloud) Is this a game to you?!

CJ: (at IDC) Oh, that history.

(Mordecai looks up at the final scene.)

CJ: (in scene) We can still make the best of this.

Mordecai: (in scene) Huh? (they kiss)

(CJ buries her head with a regretful look.

Mordecai: Alright, look. (sighs) Every time I see CJ, I mess up. I didn't mean to lead her on with the date, or the kiss, but I did. And I understand why she's mad at me.

CJ: Wait. I'm not mad at you, Mordecai. I was just embarrassed because of the way I took off after the kiss. I honestly thought you were mad at me.

Mordecai: Really?

(The second IDC member looks at them thoughtly.)

CJ: I'm definitely not mad at you.

Mordecai: Man. Sometimes I feel so dumb about this kind of stuff.

CJ: (laughs) Yeah, me too.

Mordecai: Well, you wanna start over, as friends?

CJ: Yeah! I'd love to. You know, like, as friends.

IDC #2: But what about the kiss?! The kiss! Oh, come on. Did that not mean anything?!

(Mordecai and CJ chuckle nervously.)

CJ: If I'd have known who he was, then I..

Mordecai: Yeah, I would've never, you know...

CJ: Oh, no. Totally. Never.

IDC #3: All in favor of Mordecai and CJ resuming league play?

(The IDC members start raising their spheres.)

IDC #2: Ugh! (raises sphere) Fine! But you still have to try to get each other out.

(Mordecai and CJ look at each other with a smile)

IDC #3: Then the matter is settled. You are free to resume league play.

(The IDC throw their spheres at Mordecai and CJ, who scream. They reappear back on the dodgeball court.)

Benson: (in slow motion and rage) Finish her!

Thunder Girls: (in slow motion) Finish him!

(CJ winks at Mordecai, who smiles)

Mordecai: You go.

CJ: No, you go.

Mordecai: No, you go.

CJ: Ok. (throws dodgeball at Mordecai's face, which hits him in slow motion)

Mordecai: Aaaargh! (falls back)

Referee: (blows whistle) The Thunder Girls win!

(The Thunder Girls run on the court and cheer.)

Thunder Girls: Thunder Girls! Thunder Girls!

(Benson falls to his knees and bawls,)

Benson: Noooooooo! This was the Balllerz's year! The Ballerz's year!

(Mordecai walks up to CJ and her team.)

Mordecai: Hey, good game.

CJ: You too.

Mordecai: Uh, I'm glad we're friends.

CJ: Yeah, I'm glad too. (starts to hi-five Mordecai, but quickly pulls her hand away with a smile) I'm glad that I whooped your butt! Oooooohhh!

Mordecai: (scoffs) Yeah, that was pretty good. Pretty good.

(Benson is crouched on the ground, sobbing.)

Skips: There's always next year, Benson.

Benson: I need a wing real bad.

(end of Dodge This)

(Episode starts with horror music and wolf howls on the TV)

Billy: Hello? Anyone there?

(Movie shows an abandoned donut factory in a dark and stormy night)

Maria: I don't like it Billy, I was excited when you won those all-access passes to this donut factory. But now that we're here, seems to be completely abandoned.

Billy: Shh, you're right, something fishy. There's not a donut in this place.

Maria: Uhh, if there no donuts, why do I smell...frosting?

(A man in a donut suit appeared behind them)

M&B: Aaahh!

(The donut slices the screen and it shows the title of the movie, Donut Factory Holiday; The scene shows Mordercai, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Rigby all cheering together)

Mordecai: Donut Factory Holiday!

Rigby: Best worst movie ever!

(Benson comes to the scene)

Benson: (sigh) Again? Why do you guys make such a big deal about this movie? You've seen it a thousand times, it's terrible!

Mordecai: Dude, we know, that's why it's funny.

Rigby: Yeah! It's kind of like that solo album you recorded last year if people have liked it.

Benson: And Benson For All was criminally misunderstood!

(Benson leaves the scene; Back to the movie, scene shows that Maria and Billy are now in a sewer)

Maria: Billy, are you sure this sewer is the only way out?

Billy: If you can't think of a better way of to escape an evil donut, I like to hear it. Wait! Look out! Sewer gator.

(Shows a bird landing on the crocodile's open mouth; the scene zooms to Mordecai)

Mordecai: Pfffft!

(Returns to the movie, a man in a alligator suit walking upright walks towards Maria)

Maria: Aahh.. .Ahhh... ahh... ahh... ahh... ahh.

Man in Alligator Suit: Oh now? He arrhhhgg!

(We see donuts being thrown at the TV whilst Muscle Man and High-Five Ghost are laughing, and then see Muscle Man eat a Donut)

Police Officer: Mr. President, Sir. Prototype 58 has escaped.

President: Great Scott. This is what we get for playing... uh... line?

(The screen then shows a Donut in the city with his hands up whilst we hear automatic gunfire. Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and High-Five Ghost laugh.)

Rigby: Why does he get huge for that one scene?

(The screen then shows a man whistling and putting a bin down by the curb).

Rigby: Shh! Here comes the best part!

All: Reduce! Reuse! Re-est in Peace!

(The Donut grabs a bazooka)

Man: What? No!

(The Donut then shoots a rocket at the man. We then see it moving slowly as it is being held by a piece of black string. As soon as it touches the man, he explodes, along with the rocket)

Rigby: I don't know how but it keeps getting better every time!

High-Five Ghost: I read somewhere that the guy in the Donut Suit is the director because he runs out of money to pay the actors.

Muscle Man: I heard the crocodiles in the swamp scene were four iguanas  taped together.

Rigby: Wasn't that just a guy in a suit?

Muscle Man: Uh, your thinking of the alligator scene. You got to brush on your taxonomy, bro.

Mordecai: Well, we find out for sure next time we rent it. We should get back to the store though. There's probably people waiting for it.

Rigby: Ugh! That stupid waiting list. I miss when we were the only people who knew about this.

High-Five Ghost: It's due back at the video store by five o'clock. That gives us half-an-hour.

Rigby: Plenty of time. All we got to do is eject this puppy, hop in the cart, cruise over to the... I said eject this puppy. (We see Rigby press the eject button and then turns his head around). Guys, the tape is stuck.

Mordecai: No, it isn't. Let me get it out. (Opens tape inserter and tries to pull out the tape). Yeah, it's stuck.

Muscle Man: Bros, I can't afford a late fee.

Mordecai: Okay, okay. We've got this. All we've gotta do is find someway to pull out that tape and as long as we do within the next... (points a High-Five Ghost to check the time).

High-Five Ghost: 28-minutes.

Mordecai: We can return it to the store and bam! no late fee.

Rigby: Sounds good.

Muscle Man: Let's do that.

(The scene cuts to the kitchen, where Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are waiting for Skips to arrive. Skips later arrives)

Skips: I've got my tools. What's the emergency?

Mordecai: Donut Factory Holiday is stuck in the VCR.

(Skips walks away)

Rigby: Now what?

Mordecai: Let me try something (shakes and knocks the VCR three times and looks into it to see if the movie has come out). It's never gonna come out.

HFG: I can try my families technique. (Floats to the tape) You're great. Mordecai's right! The tape's a goner!

Muscle Man: I've got this (shakes the VCR) WHOO! WHOO-OO-OO!

Rigby: (snatches the tape from Muscle Man's hands) STOP! You'll break the tape! The video is impossible to replace!

Muscle Man: No one has ever complained about my techniques before.

Rigby: Guys, guys, calm down. I'll just reach in and get it out. Just like how I prizes out of the cereal box. (Puts his hand in the VCR) He-he. My arm's not coming out. MY ARM'S NOT COMING OUT!

Muscle Man: I've got this. (Grabs the VCR and throws it, along with Rigby, onto the kitchen floor). We've gotta do something bros.

(Scene cuts to the VHS (Very Happy Service) store, where the phone is ringing)

VHS Employee: V.H.S. The home of Very Happy Service, how may I help you?

Mordecai: Oh, hi. Is there is a grace period for returning Donut Factory Holiday late due to... (looks at Rigby) unavoidable VCR mishaps.

VHS Employee: You need to have the tape on time or you'll have to pay the fee.

Mordecai: Which is?...

VHS Employee: Same as the budget of the movie. Two. Hundred. Dollars.

Mordecai: What?! Nobody can afford that. (Covers the phone with his hand) Guys, the fine is like two-hundred bucks.

VHS Employee: Also, there are some people waiting for it, but they don't really care.

Donut Fan #1: Donuts are forever.

VHS Employee: You have seventeen minutes to get it back here. (hangs up phone)

Mordecai: We need to get that tape out now. (Rigby groans, lying on the floor with the VHS player stuck in his hand) We should also get some serious help.

(The scene cuts to the Coffee Shop, where Eileen is watering a plant named Tumurra)

Eileen: Ooh, you're getting big there, Tumurra.

Muscle Man: EILEEN!

Eileen: Guys? What's going on?

Muscle Man: Rigby needs you help. No time to explain!

Eileen: What?! Is he hurt or what happ- Oh. Steffan!

Steffan: Yes, Ma'am!

Eileen: Warm up a tub of butter from the pantry stat!

Steffan: On it!

Eileen: Lay him down on the table.

(Muscle Man and Mordecai put Rigby down on the nearest table, whilst Rigby is groaning)

Eileen: Hey, buddy. How are you holding up?

Rigby: (weakly coughs) Eileen. It's pretty much over for me. I'm so glad I got to see you... before... the end.

Eileen: Rigby, you know you're not

Rigby: I'm gonna miss your face. Your glasses, you little side pony. From now on, I'll be known as "Old Man VHS Hand".

Eileen: That's creepy.

Steffan: Here's your butter, ma'am.

Eileen: Don't worry Rigby. We're gonna get you out of here.

(Eileen pours the butter into the VHS.)

Eileen: Well? Can you get it out?

Rigby: No. Now it's stuck and it's making me feel weird.

Muscle Man: There's no time, bro. We're out of options. We have to go nuclear.

Rigby: (Whimpers) Eileen?

Eileen: I don't know. It could work.

(Muscle Man grabs a hammer and then uses his arms to grasps it and smash the VCR. Rigby screams as soon as he goes near the VCR Suddenly, Mordecai grabs the hammer in order to stop Muscle Man from smashing the VCR.)

Rigby: Wait? Huh?

Mordecai: Don't smash it. I didn't wanna have the resort to this... but... we have to go the VCR Repair Shop.

Rigby: Woah, dude. You don't have to do it for me. It might be easier just to break my arm.

Mordecai: Let's just do it. Maybe he won't be creepy this time.

(Muscle Man and Mordecai pick up Rigby and run out towards the door whilst he is groaning.)

Eileen: Have you just tried letting go of the tape or - ? (M, R, Muscle Man and HFG run out the door) Men. Am I right, Tumurra?

(The scene cuts to the VCR Repair Shop. The duo, along with Muscle Man and HFG, walk into the store)

Mordecai: Lazy Dave?

Lazy Dave: Mordecai? Did your mom come with you?

Mordecai: No, just me and my buddies.

Lazy Dave: Ah, dang. Still? Did you know Mordecai's mom and I used to date. Until that fateful night, when the rain started to fall and... (stares at the VCR) Uh oh. A Rewind King X2. This thing is unbreakable.

Mordecai: Can you just try to get it out?

Lazy Dave: Only if you put in a good word with your mom for me.

Mordecai: No.

Lazy Dave: Fine. We'll start off by popping the face off he VCR (Dave grabs a screwdriver to remove the case, but during the process, the screwdriver snaps in two) You sure your mom's still married.

(Mordecai groans)

Muscle Man: Wait! We don't have to get the tape out. (expanded line soon)

(Scene cuts to the VCR Repair shop)

Muscle Man: Here you go. One tape as agreed upon. And I believe nowhere in the contract does it state that the tape has to be watchable.

VHS Employee: It's the first line! (Shows the contract, where it says "I must return the tape in a watchable condition", along with some signatures made by Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost) And you can't return a tape stuck in a VCR. It also have a dude's arm in it!

Donut Fan #1: Actually, I've been waiting for so long, I don't mind if there is an arm stuck to it.

VHS Employee: The customer gets what the customer wants. Wait here until I get the arm removal shears. (Looks for the Arm Removal Shears) Where did the shears go?

Mordecai: Let's get out of here.

(The group back away quickly from the counter whilst the VHS employee finds the shears.)

VHS Employee: Here they are. Wait. We've got runners!

(We cut to a scene showing a sign for a person named Tape Hunter. Coming out of hiding hole, Tape Hunter stands there with his hands by his shoulders)

Tape Hunter: The customer is always responsible for all lost and damaged tapes.

(Tape Hunter gets onto a bike called "My Friend, the Motorbike"

Donut Fan #2: Yay! Tape Hunter.

(Scene cuts to the outside of the VHS Store)

Rigby: We're never going back to that store.

(The front of the store is blown up by Tape Hunter's grenade)

Tape Hunter: I'm coming for that tape. (grabs a gun)

Muscle Man: Step on it, bros! (Mordecai drives the car at a super fast speed, along with Tape Hunter on his motorbike)

Rigby: The video store has it's own bounty hunter?

(We zoom in to the Bounty Hunter driving his motorbike. He eventually drives over to the left-hand side of the golf cart)

Tape Hunter: Give me the tape and no one gets hurt!

Rigby: Dude, we want to give you the tape!

(The Bounty Hunter grabs his gun and tries to shoot the side of the golf cart. Mordecai swerves the golf cart to another part of the road. Mordecai and Tape Hunter find themselves on different sides of the road.)

Mordecai: What now?

Rigby: Step on it!

(Mordecai drives the cart, along with Tape Hunter on his motorbike)

Mordecai: What's the plan, Rigby?

Rigby: Stay on target!

(The bounty hunter uses his gun to shoot the group in the cart. Rigby stands up and prevents that from happening by using the VCR as a shield. The laser eventually hits the front wheel of the motorbike.)

Tape Hunter: Argh! A Rewind King X2?! Try blocking this!

(Tape Hunter throws a grenade, which turns out to be a dumb idea as Rigby uses the VCR once again as a shield. The grenade hits the motorbike, exploding, leaving Tape Hunter fly in the air and fall into a garbage bin.)

Rigby: Reduce, reuse, re-

Muscle Man: TREE!!!

(Everyone in the golf cart screams as they hit the tree. The VCR comes flying out of Rigby's hand and smashes into a nearby wall)

Mordecai: There's no way the tape survived that. Maybe we can pay for the tape on a plan fee.

Rigby: Argh! I knew I should've never put my hand in the VCR! (Hits himself with the tape, which he doesn't notice) Stupid! Stupid!

Muscle Man: Bro, the tape!

Rigby: (laughs and then kisses the tape) Mmm... Buttery.

(The scene cuts to the V.H.S. store)

VHS Employee: Well, you win some and you lose some. You did blow up our staff bounty hunter, but you did return Donut Factory Holiday on time. Let's call it square. Normally, I would have to pay you a tape washing fee because... the thing's... covered in butter but those guys don't mind so whatever.

Donut Fan #1: We're even happier this way. Actually, we are huge butter fans.

(Donut Fan #3 pulls his shirt up showing us a layer with an image of butter.

Mordecai: Well, I'm ready to go.

Rigby: WAIT!

(We see a tape for the movie Donut Factory Holiday: Spring Break)

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost: Movie night!

(The scene cuts to the house)

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost: DFH! DHF! DFH DFH! DF- (Rigby walks up to the TV to play the movie, but doesn't notice that there is no VCR. When Rigby thinks he puts it in the VCR, the tape falls onto the table)

Rigby: Oh, yeah. We smashed the VCR.


(End of Donut Factory Holiday)
(The episode begins with Rigby on the couch watching TV, and Mordecai walks up)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai, do me a solid and get me a lemonade from the kitchen?

Mordecai: Okay, but you owe me a solid.

Rigby: Of course, that's how solids work.

(Mordecai offers Rigby the lemonade. Rigby takes it. A commercial on the television shows a bald, muscular man using a shake-weight)

Mordecai: Uhh! Do me a solid and change the channel?

Rigby: Do me a solid and pass the remote, so I don't have to get so close to the commercial?

(Mordecai hands Rigby the remote. The two are now in the kitchen)

Mordecai: Do me a solid and turn this comic book page?

(Cut to upstairs)

Rigby: Do me a solid and dry my hands?

(Rigby flaps his hands while Mordecai looks disgusted)

(Cut to outside on the porch)

Mordecai: Do me a solid and fluff this cushion?

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby's room)

Rigby: Sharpen my pencil?

Mordecai: Fold these socks?

(Cut to the kitchen)

Rigby: Cheese these nachos?

(The two laugh goofily and cheese the whole box of nachos)

(Cut to outside.)

Pops: (In the cart) Yoo-hoo! Mordecai, Rigby!

Mordecai & Rigby: Hey, Pops. Hey, Skips.

Skips: Ya think ya want some chips with that cheese?

Rigby: Oh, yeah. I guess we over did it with the cheese, huh?

(Rigby throws the nachos at a tree)

Rigby: Huh!

(Pops, Skips, Mordecai and Rigby laugh goofily)

Pops: Aren't you suppose to be working at the Snack Bar today?

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Rigby: Do us a solid and cover for us?

Skips: You shouldn't abuse the power of the solid. Bad things will happen.

Mordecai: Can you at least pretend you didn't see us?

Skips: Okay. But you owe me a solid.

(Skips and Pops exit the scene)

Rigby: We should probably get out of here.

Mordecai: Do me a solid and buy me a cup of coffee?

(Cuts to the The Coffee Shop )

Rigby: Do me a solid and pull out my seat?

(Mordecai pulls out a chair and Rigby sits in it)

Mordecai: Don't look now dude, but Eileen is totally checking you out. (Eileen is now at the scene, checking at Rigby while she cleans a table) I think she likes you.

Rigby: Shut it!

Mordecai: You should go for it. You'd make a cute couple.

Rigby: STOP TALKING! (Repeatedly punches Mordecai)

Mordecai: Here's your chance. Dude, she's coming this way.

Eileen: Hey guys, here's your order. I triple dipped your sandwich, Rigby, just the way you like it. So, um, Rigby, I was wondering, do you like miniature golf? (Rigby just stares) Me, too! Uh, you know, in an ironic way. My shift ends early tonight. Wanna go?

Mordecai: Yeah Rigby, wanna go?

Rigby: Yeah, I waxing my car tonight, so..

Eileen: Oh, that's cool. I didn't mean it like a date or anything, it would be a group thing; you, me, Mordecai, and Margaret. (Mordecai looks surprised) But it's cool if you're busy, totally cool, totally. I'll get you a refill. (Eileen then walks away, looking depressed, and speaks quietly to herself) Idiot...idiot...

Rigby: Ugh. Why did we have to come on her shift?

Mordecai: Dude, do me a solid and go out with Eileen so I can go on a date with Margaret.

Rigby: What? Why?

Mordecai: Dude, come on. This is my chance to finally get with Margaret.

Rigby: No, I'm not doing it.

Mordecai: What do you want? I'll do your work for a week. You can be player one at any video game.

Rigby: Dude, there's no way I'm going out with Eileen.

Mordecai: Rigby, please! You have to do me this solid.

Rigby: Alright, I'll do it for 10 solids.

Mordecai: (Mordecai hits the table) What? That's ridiculous!

Rigby: Ok, that's cool. Then I guess you don't mind "Morde-crying" yourself to sleep tonight, instead on going on a hot date with Margaret.

Mordecai: Argh! Fine, I owe you 10 solids.

Rigby: Then it's a date.

(Outside of the coffee shop)

Mordecai: I'm telling you dude, I'm gonna make my move tonight with Margaret. I'm gonna make my move!

Rigby: Yeah, making your move to total loser-dom.

Mordecai: Rigby, be cool.

Rigby: Oh, I'll be cool alright, (To himself) but I might have to use a solid or two to get though.

(Margaret and Eileen come out)

Eileen: Hi Rigby, you look nice.

Rigby: (Flatly) Oh, hey Eileen.

Mordecai: I hope everybody's ready for an awesome night. I was thinking that maybe after mini golf, we can grab dinner and then, uh, maybe a late screening of Fat Heat. You guys like that movie?

Margaret: Wow Mordecai, you really figured out tonight's plans.

Rigby: Yeah, he wants to make it last, (Quietly) cause it will never happen again. (Mordecai punches Rigby) Ow!

Margaret: Well, I guess we better get going if we're gonna fit all that in. (All four walk to Margaret's car) It should be unlocked.

(Mordecai stares at Margaret, and sighs lovingly)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai? Can you do me a solid and hang back with Eileen?

Mordecai: Agh! Fine. (We go to the next scene, showing the mini golf area) Hey, Margaret check it out! (Sticks two pencils to his teeth, and talks in a transylvania accent) I want to suck your blood. So red and juicy.

Margaret: (Pretends to defend herself with a putter) Aah! Stay back! I've got a putter, and I'm not afraid to use it.

Eileen: Hey, Rigby, look at me! (She kicks sand over a pile of golf balls) I just laid sea turtle eggs, and now I'm gonna swim out to sea. Although, many of my hatchlings won't live to adulthood.

(The others stare at Eileen)

Rigby: Let's just get this over with. (We now cut to Margaret, ready to putt the ball) Hey, Mordecai. (Rigby gestures Mordecai to come over)

Mordecai: Ugh!

Rigby: Do me a solid, and yell as loud as you can.

Mordecai: What? Why? You don't even get anything out of that.

Rigby: Cool, then we can call off this stupid date and go home.

Mordecai: Okay, okay. I'll do it. (He screams which messes up Margaret's shot) 

Mordecai (continued): (Sheepishly) Ha, ha. Ha...hey.

(Cuts to the next scene where the gang are having lunch)

Mordecai: Sorry about ruining your shot earlier, Margaret.

Margaret: (Gulps) Oh, it's no big deal.

Mordecai: Yeah, especially since you beat us all.

Margaret: I've had a lot of practice. My dad used to bring me here when I was little.

Mordecai: Well, in honor of your big win, I made you a trophy. (Shows her a figure made out of fruit, and he makes monster noises)

Margaret: Oh, wow! I'll treasure it for as long as it stays fresh. (Laughs)

Rigby: Hmph.

(Eileen starts throwing spices at Rigby like confetti)

Eileen: Whoo-hoo! Congratulations on second place, Rigby!

Rigby: (Groans and puts hot sauce on his burrito) Mordecai, can you do me a solid and tell me if this burrito tastes fishy?

Mordecai: Ahh. (Grabs the burrito, takes a bite, and notices the spiciness. He accidentally spits it on Margaret. Then he takes a sip of his drink) Aah! Dude, what did you put in that?

Rigby: Hmph!

Mordecai: Oh, wow. Sorry Margaret.

Margaret: (Wipes the food off her and sighs) It's okay. I didn't like this top, anyway.

(Cuts to the movie theater)

Rigby: Psst, can you do me a solid and get some popcorn?

Mordecai: I'm all out of money!

Rigby: (Clicks his tongue while pointing to Margaret) Eeh.

Mordecai: Ugh! Uh, hey Margaret, can I borrow five bucks?

Margaret: (Annoyed) Sure, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Thank you.

(Mordecai gets out of his seat to get popcorn for Rigby while the movie plays)

Bellhop: You have a telephone call at the front desk.

Man: (On the phone) Yes, I understand. (A lady walks up to him) That was the tailor again. (Mordecai passes by Margaret with the popcorn) He says there's nothing else we can do.

(Mordecai gives the popcorn to Rigby and he starts eating)

Lady: (Gasps) Did he try?

Man: He's tried everything!

Rigby: Hey, do me a solid and get some butter up in this.

(Mordecai gets up again to get the butter, then returns)

Mordecai: Here.

Lady: We can't go in yet. The reactor needs to cool down.

Rigby: (While Rigby eats his popcorn, Eileen reaches out to hold Rigby's hand. Rigby then gives Eileen the popcorn) Dude, my hands are all slick from the butter. Do me a solid and get some napkins.

Mordecai: (Pulls out napkins) You mean these napkins? Ohhhhh! (Throws the napkins in Rigby's face) In your face! Someone just wasted their sixth solid!

Rigby: (Wipes his hands off) Hey, do me a solid and take the heat for this.

Mordecai: Take the heat for what? (Rigby takes a deep breath, and blows out a fake fart) Ugh... (Stands up) Sorry. Sorry, everybody.

(Cuts to the house)

Eileen: This is where you live? Wow!

Mordecai: Ha ha, yeah. Make yourselves at home.

(Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen sit down on the couch)

Rigby: Man, I don't know about you guys, but I can go for some dessert. Mordecai?

Mordecai: (Glaring) Yes, Rigby?

Rigby: Can you do me a solid and get us some ice cream sandwiches? Ahh. Make it a double solid, and get the good ones from the Snack Bar.

Mordecai: (Glares again) I'll be right back. (Walks away)

Eileen: Do you have any board games?

(Mordecai later comes back)

Mordecai: Alright, I brought them.

Muscle Man: It's about time.

Mordecai: Why are Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost here?

Muscle Man: Rigby said there were ice cream sandwiches at this party. (Snatches the bag from Mordecai) Hook it up! (Takes one out and shows it to the girls) Hey ladies, you want some of this?

Margaret: (Takes sandwich form Muscle Man) It's getting pretty late. I think I'm gonna go home.

Mordecai: What? No, the night's still young! Can't you hang out a little longer?

Eileen: Yeah, Margaret. We haven't even eaten our ice cream sandwiches yet.

Muscle Man: They're the premium kind.

Margaret: Alright.

Mordecai: Great. Rigby, can I see you in the kitchen for a second?

Rigby: What for? (Mordecai grabs him by the arm) Aah! Ok!

Mordecai: (Sternly) We'll be right back.

Muscle Man: Awkward. (Continues eating his sandwich)

Mordecai: Why are you using your solids to ruin my date with Margaret?

Rigby: Why'd you use your solid to ruin my life?

Mordecai: (Facepalms) Aaagh! Quit being a baby.

Rigby: Watch it. You don't wanna mess with someone who still has one solid left.

Muscle Man: (Off-screen) Hey ladies, watch what else I can do with my ice cream sandwich.

Margaret: (Off-screen) Mordecai, I think I'm gonna go soon.

Mordecai: Fine. Just use your last solid and get it over with. I don't want Margaret to leave.

Rigby: Okay... Can you do me a solid and... (Whispers the solid to Mordecai, and Mordecai seems to be disturbed)

Mordecai: No, no way! I'm not doing that!

(Rumbles can be heard and the ground starts shaking. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Rigby: (Angrily) You have to, it's a solid!

Mordecai: You're insane! I'm not doing it! (Rumbles can be heard again, but Mordecai just ignores them and walks over to Margaret) Hey Margaret, you wanna check out my record collection before you go?

Margaret: I don't--

Eileen: Yeah, Margaret, you love music. I'll stay down here with Rigby.

Margaret: Okay.

Rigby: Mordecai!

Mordecai: Just ignore him.

(Rumbles can be heard again, again and this time, Muscle Man Margaret and Eileen can hear them.)

Eileen: What was that?

Rigby: You'd better do it!

Mordecai: Lay off, Rigby!

(Margaret and Mordecai begin to go upstairs. A large earthquake occurs, slowly tearing the house apart)

Margaret: What's happening?

Eileen: (Runs to Rigby) Rigby! (A piece of the floor breaks and lifts her up slightly, hitting her in the face)

Rigby: (Points to Mordecai) It's because you didn't do the solid! Do the solid!

Mordecai: No!

(The house rumbles even more; viewed as if trapped in an erupting volcano. Everyone except for Mordecai and Rigby   grab any securing place possible)

Rigby: Do it, or we're gonna die!

(Margaret screams)

Mordecai: I don't care. I'm not doing it.

Rigby: You have to!

(Benson, Skips and Pops walk in)

Benson: What are you two doing?!

Skips: I thought I told you not to abuse the solids.

Mordecai: It wasn't me! It was Rigby! He asked me to do one that was worth like 10 solids!

Skips: What was it? (Mordecai whispers the solid to him) Wow, that's crazy.

Rigby: But he's gotta do it! It's a solid!

Skips: Do us a solid and do your solid.

Mordecai: No! No way!

Margaret: Just do it already, Mordecai!

Mordecai: But you'll never respect me again!

Margaret: Not if you're just doing a solid! That's what friends are for! They come through for each other when they need it most!

Mordecai: (Amazed) Wow, I guess I never thought of it that way before.

Eileen: Margaret does solids for me all the time.

Margaret: Yeah! Like tonight, I broke a date so Eileen could go out with Rigby!

Mordecai: Wait, you're only here because you're doing Eileen a solid? (Looks down in shame)

Rigby: Hey, um, we're really gonna die if you don't do me that solid.

(Margaret screams and jumps as the stairs begin to crumble)

Mordecai: Fine, you win. I'll do it. (Stands in front of everyone and crouches down, making weird noises. Pops covers his eyes and Skips shakes his head)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro.

(As everyone watches in disgust, Rigby records it on tape. Scene cuts to him, Pops, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost watching it)

Rigby: Ok, ok. Shh, shh. Get ready, here it -- here it comes in 5, 4, 3, 2...

Mordecai (on the tape): Honk, honk. Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

(All laugh. Mordecai walks downstairs with a displeased look on his face)

Mordecai: You're watching it again?

Rigby: This is a new version I edited together. Dude, come over here! You gotta see the look on your face, it's the best part.

Muscle Man: Ahaha! Classic!

Mordecai: You know what, Rigby? You're a jerk! Have fun with your little tape. I'm going to the arcade. (Begins to walk away)

Rigby: Aw, come on, Mordecai. Don't be like that. I'll come with you.

Mordecai: No way, I'm done hanging out with you! You're not my friend! I'm outta here...

Rigby: Mordecai, wait! I almost forgot. I still owe you that solid.

Mordecai: What solid? What are you talking about?

Rigby: That solid, remember? The one where you told me to destroy the tape.

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: Yeah. I was just about to do it. (Takes out the tape) I hope there's no hard feelings. (Destroys the tape)

Muscle Man: Aw, man! What is wrong with you?!

Rigby: Sorry, guys. A soild's a solid.

Muscle Man: Aw, what? Come on!

Pops: Oh, well. I suppose it's true.

Mordecai: Hey, Rigby.

Rigby: Yeah?

Mordecai: Do me a solid and come to the arcade with me?

(The episode starts at the Park's house with Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, Starla and Margaret driving back from pizza.)

Rigby: Ah, stuff so good.

Muscle Man: Mama mia.

Starla: Thanks for driving.

Margaret: Yeah, no problem.

Mordecai: Man, who knew pizza can be so good.

Margaret: Uh, that's kinda it's thing.

Rigby: Go, go, go. (Rigby, Muscle Man and Starla rush towards the window to watch Mordecai and Margaret) Shh, Shh. Come on, come on.

Muscle Man: No way man. No way.

Rigby: Here it comes. (They watch as Mordecai and Margaret awkwardly hug.)

Muscle Man, Starla, and Rigby: Ugh!

Rigby: Ugh, man! Ugh!

Muscle Man: Told ya.

(Muscle Man, Starla and Rigby sit on the coach, when Mordecai comes back inside, they stare at him)

Mordecai: So, what do you guys wanna do... now? What?

Muscle Man: That was painful, bro.

Mordecai: What was?

Rigby: That. Uh, uh. Uh.

Mordecai: You guys were watching me!? Ugh, geez.

Muscle Man: Dude, bro, when are you gonna seal the deal? You've been like wanting to kiss Margaret for years now.

Rigby:  This is real talk.

Mordecai: What? What do you guys know? I'm just...waiting for the right moment.

Muscle Man: Bro, you gotta make the moment. Watch. (To Starla) Did you have fun tonight, babe.

Starla: I always do.

Muscle Man: I hope you saved room for desert.

(Muscle Man and Starla make out)

Rigby: Hmm, seems simple enough.

Mordecai: Ugh, you guys don't get it! It's not easy for me. I try.

Rigby: Really?

Mordecai: I mean, I've had some chances in the past that didn't work out, but it's just gotta feel right, you know. Uhh, I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with me.

Muscle Man: Sounds like you need some extra incentive, bro.

Mordecai: Yeah, like what?

Muscle Man: Hmm. (laughs) Okay, it's Sunday. If you kiss Margaret by midnight Friday, I'll wear a diaper for a whole week.

Mordecai: Whooa.

Rigby: Whooa, now we're talking!

Mordecai: Alright, I can do that.

Muscle Man: But of course, if you don't kiss her, you've gotta wear the diaper for the week.

Mordecai: Aw, what? I don't know. This is probably the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

Muscle Man: Hey, you already want to kiss her, right? So all you gotta do is kiss her. Then you can laugh at me in a diaper. It's a win-win, bro.

(Mordecai looks at Rigby and Starla. They are smiling and moving back and forth.)

Mordecai: Alright, I'll do it.

Muscle Man: Whooo! Oh, man! I got you good! (laughs and jumps on the table) You could be wearing a diaper for a week! He's never gonna do it! He's never gonna do it! Diapie time! (laughs)

Starla: You're so bad.

(Starla and Muscle Man make out and leave)

Rigby: Whoa ho ho! Betting big time huh?

Mordecai: Pff. It's no big deal. I just have to kiss her. Oh no. I have to kiss Margaret before midnight Friday.

(The next scene shows Mordecai and Rigby at the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: Dude, we've been here for an hour. You gonna ask her out, or what?

Mordecai: I'm working up to it. Here she comes. Act natural. (Slurps an empty glass)

Margaret: Hey guys. Dude, that glass is empty.

Mordecai: (laughs nervously) Oh yeah, it is. So, do you want to hang out tonight?

Margaret: Like a date?

Mordecai: Yeah, like a hangout, or chillsesh, whatever you like to call it.

Margaret: Sorry, I can't.

Mordecai: I mean, it could be a group thing too.

Margaret: No, I mean I can't tonight, I have class. I'm free Friday night though.

Mordecai: Sure, sounds great.

Margaret: Cool. See you then. (She leaves)

Mordecai: See ya.

Rigby: Dude, Friday!?

Mordecai: Ugh! The bet would practically be over then.

Rigby: Yeah man. And if that date was awkward like that conversation was, Margaret's never gonna let you kiss her.

Mordecai: It's cool. It just means I've got time to get ready.

(While "You Might Think" by The Cars is playing, the next scene starts off on Monday, where Mordecai is getting some exercise, with Rigby cheering him on, and Muscle Man buys every bags of diapers at the store. Then on Tuesday, Mordecai is at the store buying mints, and magazines about how to kiss, and while he practices, a woman gives Mordecai her phone number. Then on Wednesday, Mordecai is getting a haircut, then after that, when Mordecai is finding something cool to wear, he finds all the bags of diapers that Muscle Man bought in his dresser. Then on Thursday, Mordecai does some push-ups, with Rigby timing him, and then we see Mordecai getting a free massage, and getting a tuxedo, and when he had to pay $1,500 for it, he just runs away. Now it's Friday, and Mordecai and Rigby are outside, with Mordecai wearing a shirt a tie and a fanny pack on his waist)

Rigby: Big night, dude. How're you feeling?

Mordecai: You know, I'm actually feeling pretty good.

Rigby: That's good. But I do have one piece of advice.

Mordecai: You gotta pack a mint, bro.

Rigby: That's what I was gonna say. How did you know?

Mordecai: Pff. Everybody knows that. (unzips his fanny pack to show Rigby whats inside) I got it covered. Mints, gum, strips, breath spray, toothbrush, floss.

Rigby: Remember, you got till twelve tonight.

Mordecai: Wish me luck. (He leaves)

Rigby: Good luck.

(Muscle Man comes out)

Muscle Man: Think he'll really do it?

Rigby: Not a chance.

Muscle Man: Wanna follow him?

Rigby: Yeah-a!

(Rigby gets in the golf cart with Muscle Man and they start to follow Mordecai laughing)

(Mordecai is at Margaret' apartment, and rings her doorbell, and while he waits, he takes a mint. Margaret comes out wearing high heals and a yellow dress)

Margaret: Hey, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Hey. You look nice.

Margaret: Thanks, you too. Should we get going?

Mordecai: Ye-yeah. (opens the car door for Margaret) Your chairette, m'lady.

Margaret: (laughs)

Mordecai: Thanks again for letting me borrow your car.

Margaret: Hey, it would be nice having you to drive me around for a change. Makes me feel special.

Mordecai: (laughs) Yeah. (he drops the key and when he tries to get it, he accidentally honks the horn)

Margaret: You nervous about something?

Mordecai: (laughs) Why would I be nervous?

(Now Mordecai and Margaret are at the movie theater)

Margaret: Oh man, I haven't seen a movie in forever. What do you see?

Mordecai: How 'bout Oopsie Daisy?

Margaret: What?

Mordecai: Oopsie Daisy. You know, starring Jannie Rachel as Daisy? The woman who meets the perfect man--?

Margaret: (gasps) "Bucktooth Bob Goes to Europe"! I didn't know it was out yet! Come on, we have to see it, I love Bucktooth Bob!

Mordecai: Really? But I thought we see Oopsie Daisy. It's got a heartwarming story, some romance.

Margaret: Boring! Come on, let's have some laughs.

Mordecai: (reluctantly) Two for "Bucktooth Bob Goes to Europe".

Bucktooth Bob: Man, what the heck is this? A boot washer? (Everyone but Mordecai laugh. Mordecai then takes a whole bag of mints, and then he holds Margaret's hand, and they stare at each other) What do you call this place?

Man in movie: The Eiffel tower. (slips on a banana peal)

Bucktooth Bob: "I-fell" tower? More like "He-fell" tower.

(Everyone but Mordecai laugh again. Then Mordecai notices that Rigby and Muscle Man are behind him, and Muscle Man shows Mordecai a diaper)

(Then Mordecai and Margaret exit the theater)

Margaret: Ah, oh my gosh, my stomach. It hurts. That was so good.

Mordecai: Yeah, ha.

Margaret: I had a really great time tonight, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Yeah, me too.

Woman: I had a really great time tonight. (she and her boyfriend kiss, along with other couples kiss)

Margaret: Ugh, like get a room, right?

Mordecai: Yeah, ha.

Margaret: Well, I guess it's getting kinda late, so--.

Mordecai: What? No, no, it's only 11:2--. 11:25!?

Margaret: Yeah see, so maybe I should go.

Mordecai: No no. Come on, I'm having too much fun.

Margaret: Oh yeah?

Mordecai: Yeah. Look, there's one more place I need to take you.

Margaret: Alright, I'm game. (Mordecai takes Margaret back to the park's lake) It's beautiful!

Mordecai: Yeah, this is one of my favorite places in the park.

Margaret: Let's go sit by the water. (gets out of her car)

Mordecai: Sure. Just one kiss. You can do this. (Muscle Man and Rigby spy on Mordecai) Just--. Ahh! What are you guys doing?

Muscle Man: Six minutes till diaper time, bro. You gonna make your move, or just keep talking to your reflection all night?

Mordecai: I was just about to do it.

Margaret: Mordecai! You coming?

Mordecai: Yeah, just a sec.

Muscle Man: Better get out there.

(Mordecai gets out his fanny pack from the glove compartment)

Mordecai: Right. This is gotta be perfect. (he chews up all the gum, takes a lot of mints, and spots Margaret putting on lipstick. Then he gets nervous, and takes a couple mint strips)

Muscle Man: I think you're good, bro.

(Then ice come out in the car)

Rigby: Uh, seriously dude, you should stop.

Margaret: Mordecai!

Mordecai: Coming!

(Then, Mordecai sprays some breath spray, then he feels sick and a minty breeze comes out of his mouth, creating a winter wasteland)

Rigby: What happened?

Mordecai: (coughs) Hey, where you going?

Margaret: It got really cold all of a sudden. I think we should go back. (Margaret tries to open the car door, but it's stuck) Ugh, it's frozen shut.

(More ice comes on the car, and Muscle Man comes out)

Muscle Man: Aw man! We gotta get outta here!

Rigby: But we got to see if he does it!

Margaret: Muscle Man? Rigby? What are you guys doing here? And see who does what?

Muscle Man: You better tell her about the bet, bro.

Margaret: Bet? What bet?

Mordecai: Uh, well see, it wasn't a bet per se. I just said I would kiss you by Friday at midnight, and if I didn't, I have to wear a diaper for a week.

Margaret: What?

Mordecai: See, but if I did kiss you, then Muscle Man would wear the diaper, so yeah, it was pretty much a bet.

Margaret: So you bet Muscle Man that you could kiss me?!

Rigby: Well, it was more than he would kiss you, not could.

Margaret: QUIET, RIGBY! I can't believe you, Mordecai! Here I thought we were having a great time on a fun date, and it was all for a dumb bet?

Mordecai: Yeah, but--.

Margaret: Ugh! (she runs off)

Mordecai: Margaret, wait!

Muscle Man: Nice going, bro.

Mordecai: Ugh! (runs after Margaret) Margaret! Margaret! You're gonna freeze out here!

Margaret: (off-screen) I don't care!

Mordecai: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'd wear a diaper for the rest of my life if only you forgive me for how dumb I was being.

Margaret: (off-screen) What is wrong with you? You always do this. Every time it seems like we're getting close, you throw me for a loop.

Mordecai: I don't know what's wrong with me!? (his foot starts to get frozen, but breaks it) It's just that, (his other foot gets caught) you're like one of my best friends, and (he breaks the ice off of his foot) I get all weird when I'm around you. (Both of his legs get caught in ice) Sometimes I don't know what to do about it.

Margaret: How about trying to be honest with me? That would be a good start. And you better talk fast.

(Mordecai's entire body but his head gets trapped in ice)

Mordecai: Yeah your right, okay. Look, I really just wanted this kiss to happen, and I lost sight of being a good friend. And the only reason I took the bet was to give me the extra confidence to go through with it. Which, didn't even work anyways, but really it's all because, I LIKE YOU!

(Long silence)

Margaret: What time is it?

Mordecai: Who cares?

Margaret: No, really. What time is it?

Mordecai: (tries to break the ice off of his left arm and checks his clock) 11:59.

(Margaret holds Mordecai close)

Muscle Man: Oh my gosh! No! No!

(The ice starts to melt and Margaret closes her eyes and leans in to kiss Mordecai. Mordecai's eyes sparkle, and he puckers up, and when they are close to kiss, Margaret dodges it, and whispers in his ear)

Margaret: Have a nice week, diaper boy.

(The next scene shows Mordecai wearing a diaper while mowing the lawn in a circle, while Muscle Man, Rigby and Starla are laughing and Muscle Man is trying to take a picture of it on his phone)

Muscle Man: Aw man! This is too good. Wait, why is he smiling? YOU'RE RUINING MY PICTURE!

Rigby: Yeah, why are you so happy?!

Mordecai: I'm happy cause I realized Margaret was actually having a great time on the date, and that means she must like me. Which means that I still have a chance to kiss her one day.

Rigby: You mean we'll have to keep waiting and waiting to see if you'll ever do something about it?

Mordecai: Hey, it's gotta be the right moment.

Muscle Man: I bet you he never does it.

Rigby: You're on.

(Episode begin at Pops' house. Rigby is opening a soda and he gives it to Mordecai. He smiles at the sunset.)

Rigby: Hmmm. (sips his drink) So, how are things with CJ now that Margaret's admitted she has feelings for you?

Mordecai: Psh. I don't know. Pretty weird.

Rigby: Mmmm. Mmmhmm.

(He takes another sip of his soda.)

Mordecai: I actually haven't even seen her very much. She's had some friends visiting out of town, so we haven't really had a chance to talk about stuff. It's awkward.

(The ringtone from "Mordecai and Rigby: Ringtoneers" is heard. Mordecai looks at his phone; CJ is calling.)

Rigby: Don't be afraid of your feelings, Mordecai.

Mordecai: (smugly) Thanks.

(He hits Rigby in the face.)

Rigby: Hey!

(Mordecai answers the call.)

Mordecai: Hey!

(CJ appears in split-screen.)

CJ: Hey.

Mordecai: What's up?

CJ: Mmm, not much. How are you?

Mordecai: Good, good.

(Rigby sighs in exasperation.)

CJ: Do you guys have a lot to do today?

Mordecai: Yeah. Muscle Man's wedding is tonight, so we're gonna be pretty busy. What time will you get here?

CJ: Probably right before the ceremony.

Mordecai: Cool, cool. Well, cool. I guess I'll see you later then.

CJ: Definitely. I'll see you later

(CJ hangs up.)

Mordecai: See? It's awkward.

Rigby: Well, what're you gonna do?

Mordecai: I dunno. It's fine.

Rigby: Dude!

Mordecai: I'm fine, what?

Rigby: Ok, you're fine.

(Cut to the next morning at Pops' house. The groundskeepers are gathered at the front.)

Benson: Ok, Muscle Bro's on his way with the tuxes. Skips, you've got the ice sculpture covered?

(Skips rolls out the ice sculpture; it is Muscle Man and Starla's heads lip-locking in a horn of plenty. Muscle Man gasps.)

Muscle Man:  Our horn of plenty!

Benson: (spinning pen) Let's see, what else?

(Muscle Man stands up.)

Muscle Man: Can I just take a minute to tell you guys something? If you were to ask me to assemble a team of the best wedding planners I could find, a team more potent than the sum of its parts, each wheel turning...independently...yet together...

(Muscle Man breaks down crying, and smashes the sculpture.)

Mordecai, Rigby, Pops and Hi Five Ghost: Whoa, Muscle Man!

Muscle Man: Oh no bro, oh no! I'm sorry! I didn't think I'd be this emotional, but it's been a wild ride since about 4 in the morning!

Skips: Don't worry about it, Muscle Man.

(He gets a replica of the sculpture.)

Skips (continued): We expected this.

Muscle Man: (wipes tear) You guys...(yells in happiness) I meant what I said about the...

(He feels another breakdown, but Benson comes to stop him.)

Benson: (laughs) Alright. Let's get this guy married, people!

(Cut to Parkside Lux. Inside, Mordecai and Rigby are setting up the chairs.)

Mordecai: 57, 58.

(He holds his arms out to catch the next folding chair.)

Mordecai (continued): 58...Dude!

(Rigby is covered in chairs, pretending to shoot guns. He falls back in the pile of folding chairs and laughs.)

Mordecai (continued): Man, come on. Why do you always do that?

(Mordecai's phone rings again. He fumbles with it.)

Rigby: (getting up) Oh, man.

(He grabs a folding chair and goes up to Mordecai. Mordecai turns away and answers his phone.)

Mordecai: Heey, Margaret.

Rigby: Margaret? Is she coming to the wedding too?

Mordecai: (to Rigby) Go away!

(Margaret appears on the other end.)

Margaret: (laughs) I am coming to the wedding.

Mordecai: Sorry, Rigby was just not setting up chairs.

Margaret: That actually sounds a lot better than what I'm doing.

(We get a full view of Margaret's location. Starla is being prepped for the wedding.)

Margaret (continued): Starla's turning out to be a pretty high-maintenance bride.

Starla: Ugh! I feel like a stuffed sausage! Where's Eileen with my Gas-Begone?!

(Eileen frustratingly storms in with an iced coffee.)

Eileen: You asked me to go get you an iced coffee!

(She sighs, places the iced coffee down, and storms out.)

Margaret: I should run. But I just wanted to say sorry for what happened on our double date. I apologize to CJ too. I didn't mean to make things weird, it's just-

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah, it's cool.

Margaret: Well, see you at the wedding.

(Mordecai looks back and is shocked at something.)

Mordecai: Uh, yeah. Ok, bye! (hangs up) Rigby?!

(The chairs are stacked up together instead of in rows.)

(Episode begins at Pops' house. Rigby and Eileen are playing a video game.)

Rigby: Okay. Whoever makes this jump gets to choose lunch.

Eileen: You're on!

(Rigby, who is Player 1, makes the perfect jump while Eileen fails.)

Rigby: Ohhhhh! We're going to Wing Kingdom!

(Eileen sighs. The two go back to playing as Benson comes into the living room.)

Benson: Rigby, did you clean out the gutters yet?

Rigby: No way. That's a two-man job.

Benson: Well, where's Mordecai?

Rigby: I dunno. I haven't seen him.

Eileen: Come to think of it, I haven't seen him since CJ dumped him at Muscle Man's wedding.

Benson: Yeah, no one has. He hasn't come to work for two weeks now. I tried calling, but he won't pick up.

Rigby: What? No, here. I'll call him.

(Without looking, he grabs his phone from inside the couch and speed dials Mordecai's number. He holds his phone to his ear. A vibration is heard, and Rigby hears it in the couch.)

(He opened Mordecai's phone and saw 300+ missed calls from Benson)

Rigby: Huh, that's not like Mordecai.

Benson: (frustrated) I can't believe this! You don't even know where your best friend is!?

Rigby: Hey, I've been busy. (signs which means hanging out with Eileen)

Benson: Look, I just concerned about the well-being about my employees as any park manager, but I've got a business to run in.(continues speaking)If you don't find Mordecai and bring him back to work by tomorrow, then I'm gonna have to fire him.

Rigby: (shocked) WHAT?! (stands up on the couch) WAIT! I can find him.

Benson: Well for your sake I hope so, otherwise you'll be cleaning the gutters solo from now on.

(Scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby's bedroom, Rigby digs out a pile of clothes from the whole room until the whole room is filled with dirty clothes to find Mordecai)

Rigby: (digging out socks from the drawer, speaking to himself) Come on Mordecai, give me a clue here.

(His phone rings, he took out his phone and answered the call)

Rigby: Hello?

Eileen: Hey, I checked from Margaret, she hasn't seen or heard from Mordecai.

Rigby: Yeah, his parents don't know where he is either.

Eileen: And I don't think he'll be hanging out with CJ anytime soon. Well, (she takes out a flyer of Mordecai labeled 'Missing" on the top) I'll start putting these flyers around town.Hopefully a hundred should be enough.

Rigby: Well I'll be privileging his personal stuff he doesn't like me touching, see ya.(hangs up)

(Rigby takes the mattress off and sees the note, he picks up and reads it.)

Rigby: "Dear Mordecai, stop wallowing in your lady woes and come have sodas..." 

Sad Sax: (narrating the letter) "...With other single bros! There's a place with hot sandy beaches and an All You Can Eat buffet. So pick up your sax and jam with the crew in Dumptown U.S.A.! Signed, Sad Sax."

Rigby: (annoyed) Uh, Sad Sax Guy, I should have known! At Dumptown U.S.A.? That sounds so lame! I bet nobody's ever been to this place.

Benson: Woo Hoo, Audrey who?!?! (flashbacks ends) Yep, good times. So good, that some people dont ever leave, and I dont blame them.

Eileen:  You know what?! It's OVER!! GET OUT!! Consider yourself dumped loser!! (Kicks Rigby out) Don't call me!(Slams door)

Rigby: (Weakly) D-did I just get dumped for reals?

(The Sad Sax theme plays while the camera zooms up to show Sad Sax laying on the roof)

Sad Sax: (Scoffs) Chicks man.

Rigby: How long have you been up there?

Sad Sax: Brother, I saw the whole thing.

Rigby: IT WASN'T FOR REALS!!!

Sad Sax: That's what they all say.

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby watching a TV show)

Manetti: You'll never take me, Easton! You put me in jail, I'll just escape!

Easton: Escape this, Manetti. (flips car)

Rigby: Dude, didn't he flip a car in the last episode?

Mordecai: He flips a car in every episode. "Hey, bus full of grade schoolers, learn this."

(He makes sounds for flipping the bus. They start laughing, and Benson walks in.)

Benson: Hey, come on, you two, you're supposed to be working.

Rigby: We're on our lunch break.

Mordecai: Uh, yeah, what he said.

Benson: Yeah, it really looks like you're eating up a storm there. Come on, let's go.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan)

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah, we're going. (Mordecai is about to turn off the TV)

Rigby: Wait, look.

(A commercial for the Eggscellent Challenge is on the TV)

Narrator: Only once every thousand years does an eating challenge appear with the ability to blow everyone away. The Eggscellent Challenge is that challenge. Twelve eggs, chili, cheese, biscuits and a fruit bowl. Finish in under an hour and your party eats for free. And you win this hat that says "I'm Eggscellent" on it. That's right, finish the omelet and get the coolest hat ever invented for free. Many have tried, none have succeeded, could you be the first to slay the dragon and be eggscellent.

Man: Yeah, yeah!

(Commercial ends)

Rigby: Dude, we have to win that hat.

Mordecai: Ha, yeah right. Dude, did you see the size of that omelet? No one will ever win that hat.

Rigby: Aw, come on! Did you see how awesome that hat was? It was a net hat.

Mordecai: Dude, those aren't even cool anymore.

Rigby: Yes, they are! Truckers wear them all the time. It's got air holes in the back to keep a cross breeze going and everything.

Mordecai: Alright, fine, it's cool. But seriously a twelve egg omelet, why don't you just buy the hat?

Rigby: That doesn't make a cool story. "Hey, where'd you get that hat? I bought it. Why does it say 'I'm Eggscellent' on it? Oh it doesn't matter cause I just payed for it with money!" Plus, why would you buy it anyway when you can get it for free?

Mordecai: Yeah, but the omelet probably costs more than...

Rigby: Dude, forget it! You wanna order a measly two egg breakfast, that's fine by me. But when you finish and you're still hungry, don't come crying to me cause I ain't sharing.

Mordecai: Yeah, but...

Rigby: Shubaboo!

Mordecai: But...

Rigby: Sleepypoo!

Mordecai: Ugh, alright, fine. We'll go to that restaurant. I hate it when you talk like that.

Rigby: Maybe we.

(Scene cuts to the Eggscellent restaurant)

Waiter: Have you decided?

Mordecai: I'll take the Eggs Benedict and an orange juice. (hands the waiter his menu)

Rigby: And I'll have the Eggscellent Challenge. (hands the waiter his menu)

Waiter: Oh, I wouldn't recommend the Eggscellent Challenge, it's more of a promotional item.

Rigby: Yeah and it's the only reason we're here so...

Waiter: Sir, it-it's really just...

Rigby: OK hold on, hold on, I'm confused. I'm the customer right?

Waiter: Well, yes.

Rigby: What does the sign say over there?

(sign in the distance reads 'The Customer Is Always Right' near the entrance)

Waiter: Uh, the customer is always right.

Rigby: And what am I?

Waiter: The customer.

Rigby: And the sign?

Waiter: Sir, please.

Rigby: Say it.

Waiter: The customer is always right.

Rigby: Hmm hmm hmm.

Waiter: What would you like, sir?

Rigby: Bring me the omelette.

(Scene goes to an ambulance)

Mordecai: Dude, you're allergic to eggs?!

Rigby: (weakly) I thought if I ate really fast, maybe I wouldn't notice. I just really wanted that hat. Did I win it?

Mordecai: Dude, you didn't even come close.

Rigby: Mordecai, promise me that whatever happens, you'll get me that hat.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Please, just promise you'll get the hat for me.

Mordecai: Okay, I promise.

Rigby: You're a good friend. (passes out)

Mordecai: Rigby? RIGBY?! (gently shakes Rigby) WAKE UP!

Paramedic #1: (to Mordecai) Get back! (pushes Mordecai back, and yells to Paramedic # 2) Punch it, we're losing him!

(Paramedic #1 preforms CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on Rigby while the camera dramatically zooms on to Mordecai. Scene goes to the hospital.)

Doctor: Your friend Rigby's in a coma because of an allergic reaction his body had to the eggs. Unfortunately, due to the large quantity of eggs that he consumed, there's a strong chance that he may never wake up again.

Benson: Is there anything we can do?

Doctor: All we can do is wait. I'm sorry. (exits the room)

Benson: (turns to Mordecai) Well, I hope you've learned something from all of this.

Mordecai: What?

Benson: Maybe if you've been working like you were supposed to, none of this would've happened.

(Mordecai punches Benson in the face, and everyone cries out in shock. Muscle Man and Skips hold Mordecai back; Pops and Hi Five Ghost hold Benson back.)

Benson: Mordecai, what are you doing?!

Mordecai: What's your problem?! This has nothing to do with work! He just wanted the hat!

Benson: And look where it got him! (points to Rigby) Your friend over there is only going to get you into trouble!

Mordecai: (laughs harshly) Right, take advice from Benson about friends, since you've got soooo many of 'em.

Benson: I have friends.

Mordecai: No, you don't. Everyone only hangs out with you because you're our boss! Rigby only wanted to try and win a hat. He doesn't deserve to be in a coma because of it. (walks towards the door)

Benson: Where are you going?!

Mordecai : Back to the restaurant.

Benson: Why?!

Mordecai: Because I made a promise to Rigby and I'm gonna keep it. That's what friends do for each other. (exits)

Muscle Man: Awkward.

(cuts to the restaurant.)

Mordecai : What do you mean it's not for sale?!

Waiter : I mean it's not for sale.

Mordecai: Look, my friend really wanted this hat, and now he's in a coma from trying to finish your challenge. Come on, you've got to be able to make an exception.

Waiter: Sir, I'm sorry about your friend. Really, I am. But I can't just sell you the hat. It's out of my control.

Mordecai: (groans) Then give me the omelette.

Waiter: Sir, please don't.

Mordecai: Give me the omelette.

Waiter: (brings Mordecai the omelette and sets the timer) Go! (Mordecai attempts but fails when timer rings) Time is up, sir.

Mordecai: Sell me the hat.

Waiter: I'm sorry sir. The hat is not for sale.

Mordecai: AUUUUGHHHHHHHH! (throws omelette at the wall) Forget this place. (The waiter shakes his head and the scene goes to the hospital) I'm sorry Rigby, I couldn't do it. (Benson and Skips appear for a sudden.) Huh? Oh, what are you doing here?

Benson: Look, I'm sorry for what I said earlier. It was a stupid thing to say, and I didn't mean it.

Mordecai: THGH! Yeah.

Benson: You know, there might be a way to win that hat.

Mordecai: What? What are you talking about?

Benson: Tell him, Skips.

Skips: (narrating) A long time ago, I knew a guy by the name of Jonathan Kimble. (transits to his backstory) He used to work in the park and just like Rigby, he was obsessed with the hat. His drive for the hat was relentless. Breakfast Lunch, Dinner. The omelet was the only thing he would ever eat. He kept a journal, and kept tracking every advantage he could find that would help him on his quest for the hat. One day, he was really excited. He just kept saying, "I figured it out! I figured it out!" He left to attempt it, but he never came back. (transits back to the present.)

Mordecai: So, what happened?

Skips: I don't know.

Mordecai: What do you mean? Didn't you go to the restaurant?

Skips: None of us did. He'd failed so many times, none of us thought he would ever do it.

Mordecai: Why are you guys telling me all this?

Benson: Because, we got his notebook out of his old locker. (hands Mordecai Jonathan's notebook) It looks like he figured out how to finish the omelet. (Mordecai flips through the notes) If you're willing to take the risk, you could win the hat for Rigby.

Mordecai: Let's do it.

(scene shows the park gang helping Mordecai train for the Eggscellent challenge while track "Holding Out A Hero" by Bonnie Tyler plays. Next scene shows Benson, the gang and Mordecai driving to the restaurant in the golf cart)

Mordecai: This isn't gonna be easy.

Benson: Just stick to the training. You can do it.

(Everyone gets out of the golf cart)

Mordecai: Hey, Benson, sorry about what I said before. Even though you're a jerk most of the time, you're still a good friend.

Benson: Just get in there and win that stupid hat for Rigby.

(The waiter is standing at the counter whistling and writing down something on a piece of paper. He leaves off to the restaurant dining room and approaches Mordecai reading the menu)

Waiter: Oh, good morning sir. Are you ready to order?

Mordecai: The Eggscellent challenge please.

Waiter: Sir, while I am contractually bound by the laws of this restaurant to bring you the omelet, I highly suggest ordering something else.

Mordecai: Bring me the omelet.

(Waiter brings the Eggscellent challenge to Mordecai's table and sets the timer)

Waiter: Good luck.

Mordecai: Thanks.

(Waiter walks away and Mordecai proceeds doing the challenge. The waiter looks at Mordecai surprised that Mordecai knows the strategy to winning the challenge)

Waiter: No, don't (walking back to Mordecai but Benson pushes him back)

Benson: Eh. (Muscle Man, High Five Ghost and Skips are behind Benson) Let him finish.

(The waiter whistles and the restaurant staff come in and stand behind the waiter)

Waiter: Step aside.

Muscle Man: Why don't you make us bro?

(Staff start fighting with the park members)

Benson: Keep them away from Mordecai!

(Park members and staff fight each other and prevent them from attacking Mordecai, as Mordecai is finishing the Eggscellent challenge. The timer goes off when Benson trips over the waiter nearby Mordecai's table)

Waiter: (getting up by the table) Sorry sir, time is.. up?

(view of Mordecai and the empty plate, bowl and glass)

Waiter: Oh no. We were only trying to help!

Mordecai: What?

(Benson, Skips, Muscle Man, High Five Ghost and the waiter look at Mordecai as he teleports to a mysterious room filled with hats)

Mordecai: What the...? (the Eggscellent Knight appears and Mordecai is startled) Where am I?

Knight: You have made it to the final test of the Eggscellent Challenge. Choose your prize, but take heed, for if you choose incorrectly, you will die.

(Knight points to Jonathan Kimble, who is a skeleton wearing the incorrect Eggscellent hat, which is a crown)

Mordecai: Jonathan Kimble.. (Mordecai looks at all the hats) How am I gonna choose? Which one is it?

Rigby (faded head and flash back voice): It was a net hat. Truckers wear them all the time. It's got air holes in the back to keep a cross breeze going and everything.

Mordecai: (gasps) That looks like the hat of a trucker.

(Mordecai picks up the net hat and the Knight is looking at Mordecai as he slowly puts it on his head and doesn't die)

Knight: Your choice... is eggscellent!

(Mordecai teleports back to the restaurant. The Knight walks over to a door and opens it, revealing a stock of Eggscellent net hats and places one in the huge variety of hats. Scene changes to the hospital. The park members are in Rigby's hospital room and Mordecai puts the net hat on Rigby's head)

Rigby: You won the hat for me.

Mordecai: Yeah, man, but I couldn't have done it without some help.

Rigby: Thanks guys. (gasps) LOOK!

(An advertisement on TV appears for a steak eating challenge at the Steak Universe)

Narrator: Do you like steak?

2 men on TV with cutlery and plates: Yeah!

Narrator: Well then come on down to the Steak Universe. If you and a friend can finish our 96 ounce steak and eggs in under an hour, we'll give you 2 free T-shirts that say 'Raise the Steaks'. RAISE THE STEAKS! Free. So remember when you need steak, come on down to the Steak Universe.

Rigby: Dude, I'll eat the steak if you eat the eggs.

Benson: Do you think if we take that hat off him he'll go back into a coma?

Mordecai: Only one way to find out.

(The gang walk up to Rigby to take his hat off)

Rigby: No!

(At City College, a billboard reads "Modern Dance Competition Today". Eileen performs an interpretive-type dance in a pink suit with the audience, including Mordecai, Rigby, and CJ watching. After the dance ended with Eileen diving into a garbage can to set off a party popper, the audience excitedly cheers for her. The Announcer appears on stage)

Announcer: (laughs) Okay; Let me get a "honk-honk" in here 'cause you goosed it!

(A guy managing the soundboard honks his horn twice, prompting the goose to fly away from the announcer.)

Announcer: It's time to announce the winner of the City College Modern Dance Competition. (A pigeon flies by to give the man an envelope.) Now, I don't want to "pigeon-hold" anyone, but first place today goes to Eileen Roberts with the dance "Chewed Gum"!

(Eileen screams excitedly and runs on the stage. The audience cheers.)

Announcer: To say you blew away the competition wouldn't be Ostrich (a stretch)! (Eileen squeals/screams again) Let's see how well you dance after a year of sitting in front of your very own flat screen T.V.!

Eileen: (joyous squeal) This is the best thing that's ever happened to me!

Mordecai, Rigby, and CJ: Ei-leen flat-screen! Ei-leen flat-screen!

Announcer: Thanks for coming everyone and for all of you losers today, don't Rooster (Brewster) on your laurels 'cuz there's always next year! (The announcer pulls out a rooster and it crows.)

(At the entrance)

CJ: Eileen, that was awesome!

Mordecai: Yeah! I knew you were going to win when you came out of that gum wrapper.

Rigby: Nice work, Eiloin!

Eileen: (blushes) Heh heh. Thanks, guys. Aah! I was never into T.V. before, but that was just cause I didn't have the right equipment. I wish I could go watch it right now, but I got to get to work.

Rigby: Don't worry about it Eileen. I'll drop it off at your place for ya.

Eileen: Really?

Rigby: Yeah, of course!

Eileen: Wow, thanks Rigby! I gotta run, see you guys later!

CJ: Bye!

Mordecai: Later!

Rigby: Give me a hand with this, will ya Mordecai?

Mordecai: (lifts TV box) That was really nice of you to offer to help Eileen.

Rigby: Well, I'm not actually gonna drop it off.

Mordecai: (drops box after hearing this) What?! Rigby... Eileen worked hard for this, you can't just-

Rigby: No! I'm not just gonna drop it off. I'm gonna install it for her, to surprise her when she gets home from work.

CJ: (exchanges looks with Mordecai) You are?

Rigby: We can watch some flat-screen, maybe get some pizza. It'll be awesome!

CJ: That will be awesome!

Mordecai: That might be the nicest thing you've ever done.

Rigby: Like you said, she worked hard for this. Be careful Mordecai, there's a step behind you.

Mordecai: Okay. That's enough dude. You're freaking me out.

(Circle-wipe transfers to the guys at Eileen's house)

Rigby: Hang on, let me get the key. (He grabs Eileen's key under a garden turtle figurine)

Mordecai: You know where Eileen keeps her house key?

Rigby: Yeah, I water her plants sometimes when she goes out of town for a dance invitational or whatever.

(He unlocks the door, and they went inside to find a Hanatronic TV sitting on top of a cabinet)

CJ: Wait, I thought Eileen didn't have a TV.

Rigby: Oh, yeah. That's Joanne's.

Mordecai: Who's Joanne?

Rigby: Eileen's new roommate. She's this beast who leaves all her junk everywhere and uses Eileen's hand towels to dry her butt.

CJ: (grabs a snow globe with Joanne kissing her cat inside it) Is this her?

(She hands over the snow globe to Rigby)

Rigby: Ugh, yeah! That's her alright. (He stares angrily at the snow globe) What a donkey! You know she ate an entire thing of Eileen's peanut butter but she won't even let her near the TV? One time we were just hangin' out...

(Flashback begins with him and Eileen sitting on her couch. Eileen is doing string figures with her fingers while Rigby checks his watch as it beeps)

Rigby: (gasps) It's starting! The Carter and Briggs Reunion Special! (He rushes to the TV to turn it on, but Eileen stops him)

Eileen: Wait, Rigby, don't!....Not here.

Rigby: But there's a TV sitting in front of us and a Carter and Briggs Special going on inside it!

Eileen: Aahh....ooh...

Rigby: Eileen, come on! Throw a rig a bone!

Eileen: (sigh) (uneasily) Okay, I guess since Joanne's out of town it'll be alright?

(As she turns on the TV with a remote, Joanne appeared besides the couch)

Joanne: I knew it!

Eileen: Joanne! I thought you were at the beach!

Joanne: I was at the beach, until I realized something like this might happen! How could I enjoy the surf and sun knowing you could be here, messing with my TV?!

Eileen: I'm sorry! I didn't think it- (Joanne slaps the remote away as she gasps)

Joanne: Next time, that remote will be your face. To clarify, next time I'll slap your face.

(Flashback ends to the snow globe)

Rigby: I didn't even make that up, that's exactly what happened. (Hands CJ back the snow globe)

CJ: Ok, sooo I guess we shouldn't touch any of Joanne's stuff. (Sets snow globe down)

Rigby: Yeah, I think we just put the flat screeeeenn...(looks around)...on the wall over here, it'll be cool!

Mordecai: (walks over towards Joanne's T.V.) I can't believe she still has one of these junky old Hanatronic's. (looks closely at it) This must be first generation it's so old.

Rigby: I told ya she's a beast. Her T.V.'s probably too scared to die on her. Let me just grab my tools so we can get mounting. (Rock music plays as Rigby's tool belt is shown on his waist)

CJ: Wow, Rigby those almost look real. (CJ and Mordecai then laugh softly together)

Mordecai: (points at Rigby's rope whip, still laughing softly) What's up with the whip?

Rigby: (annoyed) It's my utility whip! It was a thousand uses. (Smiles while looking at it) Eileen and I got it at a Renaissance fair.

Mordecai: When did you go to a Ren. fair? (puts wings up) And why are you two always hanging out without me?!

Rigby: You and CJ are always together doing your thing! What am I supposed to do, hang out by myself?!

CJ: (Pushes Mordecai away from Rigby) Hey, hey, cool it. (Seriously) Rigby, show us your whipping skills.

Mordecai: (annoyed) Hehe, yeah Rigby, whip it out.

Rigby: (mischievously) With pleasure. (He takes it out and whips) WhaCHA! (It whips the snow globe, breaking it. The three stand there, speechless) Uuuuuhhh, let's focus on putting up that flat screen.

(A montage begins. Mordecai and CJ pull out the T.V. from the box, then Rigby pulls out a small bag of nails and bolts. Then he starts playing with a hammer, when it hits him in the face, then he puts it away. CJ is shown making a small hole in the wall using a drill. The hole soon gives in and creates a bigger one. Rigby pulls out a bucket of plaster. Mordecai hands him a scraper, but he turns it down and instead uses his whip to get it on the hole. In the process, CJ and Mordecai get covered in it as well. Mordecai starts to put the mantle up, when he points towards a screwdriver. He gestures to Rigby to get it and Rigby uses his whip to pass it. The screwdriver ends up above Mordecai's head. Then he gives Rigby an angry glare and they start to argue. Later, Rigby puts the screws in and CJ puts up more of the mantle. They take a break and goof off for a bit. They put empty plaster buckets on their heads. CJ does the robot, Mordecai holds a broom, and Rigby whips his rope whip around. Finally they put the T.V. up)

Mordecai, Rigby, and CJ: Eileen flat screeeeeeeenn!

Rigby: Now to plug it in and try it out. (He picks up the plug and is about to plug it into the outlet, when he notices that Joanne's T.V.'s plug is taking up the whole outlet) (annoyed) UGH! Joanne's giant plug is pluggin' up the whole plug!

CJ: Just move it down to the bottom, they'll both fit. (Rigby is about to move the plug, but he hears Joanne's voice in his mind)

Joanne's voice: (Softer and softer, echoing) I'll slap your face, face, face.

Rigby: (nervous) Isn't there another outlet in here?

Mordecai: (kneels down under the computer desk) This one's looks kinda full....

Rigby: (annoyed) Alright, whatever! I'm not gonna be threatened by some socket hog! (Rearranges the plugs, now happier) And that's that. (Then Joanne shows up at the door, angry)

Joanne: What are you doing?!

Rigby: (faces her) AAHH! JOANNE!

Joanne: Did you touch my T.V.?

Rigby: No

Joanne: (walks towards him, jabs finger into chest) You better not, because the hand that touches my T.V., is a hand you'll never get back. And by that, I mean I'm ripping it off your body and keeping it.

Rigby: Look Joanne, I didn't-

Joanne: What's that?

Rigby: (covering the outlet) What's what?

Joanne: (walks forward) Move it, shrimp!

Rigby: No, wait! (Joanne shoves him, then notices the moved plugs)

Joanne: I KNEW IT! You mess with my T.V., I mess with yours! (jumps onto the flat screen on the wall, takes it down, and runs away with it)

Rigby: (worried) NO, NOT THE FLAT SCREEN!

Mordecai: (Joanne runs out the door, Mordecai runs after her but stops at the doorway) (yelling) Joanne, stop! We can talk this out! (After a couple seconds, he turns toward CJ and Rigby) (frantic) She's already halfway up the street.

Joanne: (Joanne is seen running past house after house. She then runs towards an old man in his car) Get out.

Old man: (worried) Is everything alright?

Joanne: (angry) I said get out!! (pulls the old guy out the car window, shoves him on the sidewalk.)

Old man: Aaaaahh!!! OWW!....Don't hurt me. (Joanne puts the flat screen in the car, gets in the driver's seat and drives away)

Mordecai: (back at Eileen's house, at the car) Come on Rigby, let's go! (Sees Rigby carrying Joanne's T.V.) Dude, why are you bringing that thing?!

Rigby: (with Joanne's T.V.) If she's gonna mess with Eileen's flat screen, we're gonna mess with her Hanatronic! (Puts the T.V. in the back and gets in the car after it. CJ backs the car up and drives down the road) 

Joanne: (Joanne sees them in her rearview mirror) (angry) OOOOHH, Joanne's gonna slap a face today! (speeds up and breaths angrily)

CJ: Where is she even going?!

Rigby: There's no way to know. She doesn't think like the rest of us. Just follow her! (Joanne takes a sharp right. CJ follows her)

Joanne: (notices that they are still following her) UUUUUGGGHHH! (Pulls out a bottle of "Anti-Itch Medication Lotion" and chucks it out the window) 

Mordecai: (sees it coming towards the windshield) Look out! (Impacts with the windshield and smears all over it)

Mordecai and CJ: AAAAHHH!

CJ: (uses windshield wipers and clears it off. Glares) Nice try.

Rigby: (notices a pair of dentures coming at them) TEETH! TEETH!

Mordecai, Rigby, and CJ: WooooAAAHH! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!! OOOF! (CJ swerves to the left, causing the car to crash in a bush) Uuuuuuuuhhhh...

CJ: What happened? Where'd she go?

Mordecai: (points) There she is, on the bridge! (Joanne is seen on the bridge's ledge, about to throw the flat screen down to the river below. The three run towards her, Rigby with Joanne's T.V. as well)

Rigby: Joanne! Stop!

Joanne: (still very angry) I'll teach you to mess with other people's stuff!

Rigby: (puts the T.V. down on the bridge's ledge and speaks in a negotiating manner) Come on Joanne! (Goes into the old guys car and pulls out an air horn. He uses it while speaking) Let's take it easy with the flat screen.

Joanne: GRRRRR!!

Rigby: We were wrong to touch your T.V., okay? Haven't you ever made a mistake before?

Joanne: Only mistake I made, was leaving my T.V. alone with that no respect moochwad Eileen.

Rigby: GRRRRRR!...(sighs) (cools himself down then speaks calmly into the air horn again) Heeeyy, loook. I know you wouldn't want anything to happen to your T.V., just like we wouldn't want anything to happen to Eileen's T.V. (Stops speaking into the air horn and speaks just with his voice. Joanne still looks angry) I get it Joanne. This thing has been your best friend since you were a baby. It entertained you when you were bored, it made you laugh when you were sad, and maybe, just maybe, it helps you forget for a minute that you are a hideous monster. (Joanne glares and growls at Rigby) What do ya say Joanne? Let's just swap T.V.s and move on, ok? (Speaks into the air horn again) No one needs to get hurt here.

Joanne: (looks at the flat screen) Grrrrrr....(sighs) Ok.

Rigby: Ok. (Puts down air horn and gets onto ledge. Is about to take the T.V., but Joanne chucks it down to the ground below) AAAHH!! 

Mordecai and CJ: (slow motion) NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Rigby: (deep voice, fastly) Eileen's T.V. that she won at a dance competitiiioooooonnnn!!!! (quickly pulls out rope whip and whipps towards it. The rope latches onto it, saving it. Things are silent) (sigh of relief) That was close!

CJ: Woah, Rigby!

Mordecai: Nice whip action!

Joanne: Ugh, whatever, just give me my T.V back! (at that moment, the wind blows it off and it plummets to the river. It breaks) AaaaaahhhhoooooooooAAAAAAAAUUUUGGGGHHHH!!!!! (falls on her knees and puts fists in the air)

CJ: (looks at Mordecai) She really liked that old T.V., huh? (Then a ghost comes out of the T.V.)

Joanne: Oh no! The ghost of my family's inheritance lawyer! (The ghost makes a ghost phone appear) NOOO!!

Ghost Lawyer: (dials a number) ....She failed, sir.

Joanne: (covers her face and starts to break down. A black limo then arrives, and her grandpa comes out)

Grandpa Hanatronic: (angry) JOANNE! What have you done?! 

Joanne: Grandpa Hanatronic, I can explain!

Mordecai: Wait, is your last name Hanatronic?

Joanne: Uh yeah, hello? Joanne Hanatronic, heir to the Hanatronic Television Dynasty!

CJ: (To Rigby, annoyed) Did you know that was her name?

Rigby: (shrugs) I just thought it was a weird coincidence!

Grandpa Hanatronic: ENOUGH! Why is our priceless family television sitting at the bottom of this river?!

Joanne: (slowly) It's stiiill........gooood. (A bird is shown eating on the cord)

Grandpa Hanatronic: (nods disapprovingly) You have disgraced the family name. Now, you must give up your modern lifestyle and by that I mean the shared rental unit you inhabit with that commoner.

Joanne: NOOOOOO!!!!

Grandpa Hanatronic: (Points to the open limo door) Get in the limo!

Joanne: (Walks to the limo and gets inside) UGH! Are all my horses still there?

Grandpa Hanatronic: They are. (Gets in as well)

Joanne: (grunt) (Grandpa Hanatronic shuts the door and the limo drives away)

Rigby: Wait, what just happened here?!

Ghost Lawyer: (makes ghost noises as he floats to them) I'm glaaaaaad you aaaaassssked. When Joanne asked to live on her own amongst the, shall we say, "lower classes", we allowed it, as long as she continue to protect the family's most prized heirloom, the original television her family's company produced. (The T.V. is shown, irreparably broken) In retrospect, we probably should've kept it in a safe. (Shows the lawyer again) As a result, she will no longer inherit the company.

CJ: What's gonna happen to her?

Ghost Lawyer: She will be punished with a life of opulence and leisure at the Hanatronic family manor. (Ghost noises) (fastly) She'll be fine. (Snaps and disappears) (The T.V. is shown to be shattered into pieces by a gust of wind. It then becomes part of the wind. The three look down at it as this happens)

CJ: Now I get why she didn't want you touching her stuff. 

(Scene cuts back to Eileen's house. They put the T.V. back on the wall just as Eileen walks in)

Eileen: What's going on?

Mordecai, Rigby, and CJ: SURPRISE!

Rigby: Check it out, Eileen! Your T.V.'s all set up! (rap voice) Don't worry about the installs, it's ready for your eyeballs!

Eileen: (same tone) NU-UUUUHH! (normal voice, but surprised) You guys didn't have to go to so much trouble! Thank you!!

Mordecai: It was all Rigby's idea.

Eileen: (blushes) Really?

Rigby: And as an added bonus, Joanne's not your roommate anymore!

Eileen: (To her self, does a fist pump) Yesssss! (To everyone) I mean, uh, that's cool too.

Rigby: (hands remote to Eileen) Care to do the honors? (Eileen turns the T.V. on. The news is airing)

Phil: And now let's hear from some holiday shoppers down at the Mall.

Grumpy Old Lady: Lines are long.

Brown Haired Lady: (while holding dog) It's too crowded and it smells weird.

Orange Haired Guy: Hey Mom! Look, I'm on T.V.!

Eileen: AAAHH! The local news! This is the best surprise ever!

Mordecai: Well, we wanted to order a pizza and have it ready for you when you got here, but we didn't plan ahead.

Rigby: (smirking) Or did we? (doorbell rings)

Pizza Guy: (just voice) Pizza guy!

CJ: (happy) Woah, Rigby! Impressive.

Mordecai: (happy as well) (CJ nods approvingly) Seriously! This was all really cool. I'm proud of you man.

Rigby: Thanks, Mordecai!....Now, can I borrow some money for the pizza guy?

Mordecai: Pffftt. I guess things are back to normal.

Mordecai, Rigby, CJ, and Eileen: Hahahahahaha!

Eileen: If this is normal, then I'm really happy with normal. (Rigby and Eileen smile at each other)

Pizza Guy: (knocks this time) ....Uuuuuhh, hellooo?

Rigby: Oh, uh, we'll get that, heh. (Goes to the front door with Mordecai)

CJ: (To Eileen) Should I grab some plates?

Eileen: I've got some soda in the fridge! (CJ and Eileen go into the kitchen) (No one is in the living room while the T.V. is still on)

Old Grey Haired Man: Can you tell me how to get outta here?

Margaret: Haha, looks like the usual holiday craziness, Phil! From The Two Pines Mall, this is Margaret Smith reporting live.

Phil: Stay warm out there, Margaret!

Margaret: Thanks, Phil. It's good to be back in town!

(End of "Eileen Flat Screen")

(The episode begins at the movie store. An employee is dancing around at the front. He's wearing an outfit that depicts King Kong climbing the Empire State Building)

Employee: Movies! Rent your movies! (Rigby rushes out of the store, carrying a movie case. He bumps into the employee.) Oh, sorry man.

Rigby: (chuckling) Nice outfit. (runs off)

Employee: It's a costume! They make me wear it!

(cut to the house. It's nighttime, and Mordecai and Rigby are ready to watch the movie.)

Mordecai: Movie night! (holds up a bowl of popcorn.) I got the popcorn!

Rigby: (holding up the movie, showing only the backside) I got the movie!

Mordecai: Wait, I thought we were watching Shy Guy. (He holds up the movie. The case is pink and has a big red heart on it.)

Rigby: Dude, you've seen that movie 100 times. I got something better. BAM! (shows the movie to Mordecai. It's called "Ello Gov'nor," and it has a picture of an evil British Taxi on the cover.)

Mordecai: Ello Gov'nor?

Rigby: Yeah, man, it's foreign. Check it. (reading the back) "A British taxi is possessed by the soul of its driver, seeking revenge on the lowly gang members who murdered him. Pay the fare... ( pops head from behind case) ...or pay the price."

Mordecai: No, dude, not another horror movie. Last time I had to walk you to the bathroom every night for a week.

Rigby: No, man, it'll be different. This one is old and cheesy. It will be hilarious.

Mordecai: You sure you can handle it?

Rigby: Dude, it's in black and white. Come on.

Mordecai: Mmm... alright.

(Rigby opens the case for the movie, and Mordecai turns off the light. Rigby puts the tape into the VCR, and the movie begins playing, with ominous music. The card reads, "ELLO GOV'NOR, (c) MCMLXXXII." M&R fake screaming, but laugh pretty quickly.)

Rigby: See, isn't this fun?

Mordecai: Hmph. Hmph.

(Now, we're in the movie. It starts at a boarding school. In the classroom, a boy sits quietly and opens his composition notebook to see a tire print engraved in it. He gasps, and then looks out the window to see the taxi.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(The taxi drives into the window, and, off-screen, runs him over. Mordecai laughs a little, but Rigby seems like he is scared. In the next scene of the movie, a woman is in her bathroom combing her hair. She closes the cabinet, and, in the mirror, we can see the taxi behind the shower curtain.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(She turns around and sees the British taxi come out of her shower, which runs her over off-screen. Mordecai yawns with boredom, and Rigby is scared, holding a pillow. In the movie, an old man is walking his dog, and hears the taxi's engine. It's standing behind him.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(The old man tries to run away, but he gets hit. Rigby watches in horror as the taxi eats him. He's also sweating hard.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(The taxi spits out some of the man's bones from the engine and later, it's killing more people.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

(More screaming occurs before the movie ends and the screen goes to static. Mordecai snores before immediately waking up.)

Mordecai: Huh? Is it over? (He turns off the TV and rubs his eyes) Dude, that was so cheesy. I mean, what was up with the taxi? Was it supposed to be evil or normal but haunted by a ghost... (Rigby looks freaked out by the movie) ...controlling the taxi or what? You know?

(Fade in to their room. Mordecai is peacefully asleep while Rigby trying to go to sleep. He gets up and looks through the window. He sees no taxi at first, but when he looks at the same spot again, it's there.)

Rigby: Mordecai!

(Mordecai is still asleep. Rigby turns around and sees the British taxi right by his window. He screams and runs to Mordecai.)

Rigby: (shakes Mordecai) Mordecai! Wake up! Wake up!

Mordecai: (in taxi's voice) Ello, gov'nor! (turns around to show that his eyes are lit up like carlights.)

(Rigby screams and step back. Mordecai sits up and the British taxi comes out of his body and comes toward Rigby before nightmare ends. Rigby wakes up, screaming, until he gets hit by a pillow thrown by Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a freaking maniac! (In the UK, the line is "Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a flipping maniac!" In Australia, the line is changed to "Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a maniac!". However, for some people in Australia, the line might come out as "Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a faniac!" making it slightly obvious that CNA put a censor around it.)

Rigby: I keep having nightmares!

Mordecai: Just dream about something else then. (lies back down) Dream like you're a tough guy or something.

Rigby: (trying to sleep) I'm a tough guy. (He says "tough guy" repeatedly).

(In his dream, he is a tough guy named Fists and is walking down the street at nighttime.)

Fists: They say this city's tough. But I'm tougher. (walks into a dark alley, and a gangster with half of his hair shaved off follows him with a knife)

Gangster: You walked down the wrong alley, Riggerson. (Fists pins him against the wall.)

Fists: The name's... (pulls fist back) ...Fists! (He's about to punch him, but then, the taxi comes and shines its lights on him and the gangster.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

(Fists gasps before the taxi drives into Fists. Rigby wakes up screaming from his second nightmare.)

Mordecai: Augh! (sits up) What the heck, Rigby?!

Rigby: It's that stupid British taxi! It's all up inside my brain!

Mordecai: (groans) I knew it! I knew this would happen! I told you we shouldn't have watched that movie!

Rigby: I know, I'm sorry. I can't help it.

Mordecai: (sighs) Alright, dude, we'll just desensitize you to the horror. We're gonna watch "Ello Gov'nor" over and over again until you stop being scared.

(Rigby gets scared. Cut to the living room, where Mordecai is holding Rigby to the TV as it's paused on a frame of Ello Gov'nor)

Mordecai: Look at it! Look at it!

Rigby: Let me go!

Mordecai: It's not real! You can see the microphone showing! (Sure enough, a boom mic is seen on the frame.) Look at it!

Rigby: Get off me!

Mordecai: I'm sick of you keeping me up! You look at it!

Rigby: Let me go! (fade to the daytime)

Mordecai: Look at it!

Rigby: Let me go!

Mordecai: (fade back to nighttime) Look at it! (fade back to daytime. M&R are tired) Look.... At it.  You look at it.  You...look at it.

Rigby: Let.... Me.... GO! (Rigby breaks free and gets the movie out of the VCR. He throws it against the wall as Benson comes into the room)

Benson: What the heck is going on?!

Mordecai: (pushes Rigby) Rigby's just freaked out by this dumb British movie we watched.

Benson: Well, you'd better have this mess cleaned up by the time I get back from my cricket game.

Mordecai: Cricket?

Benson: Yeah. I'm trying new things. So what?

Mordecai: (gasps) Will British people be there?

Benson: It's cricket, what do you think?

(cuts to cricket match. Sure enough, British people are there)

Mordecai: See Rigby, there's nothing to be afraid of. See how calm and collected these British dudes are? (British people come walking up to MR&B)

British People: Ello, gov'nor. Ello, gov'nor, ello gov'nor, ello, ello, ello... (Rigby gets scared by their greetings. The British people look evil for some reason. Suddenly, the British Taxi appears)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor! (Rigby screams and runs away.)

Mordecai: Rigby! RIGBY! (Rigby's still running towards the house. Pops and Skips walk up to Mordecai.) Aw man, I knew we shouldn't have watched that lame car movie.

Skips: He's scared of cars now?

Mordecai: No, just British taxis.

Pops: What a silly notion, my British taxi isn't scary at all.

Mordecai: Wait, Pops, you own a British taxi?

Pops: Yes.

(clock transition to a barn. Mordecai, Rigby and Pops are entering)

Rigby: What's in the barn?

Mordecai: Something that's gonna get rid of your fear.

(Pops opens barn doors. A yellow taxi stands alone in there)

Pops: There she is. Isn't she a beauty?

Mordecai: What the heck Pops? I thought you said you had a British taxi.

Pops: A British taxi? Oh, I thought you said a brownish taxi.

Mordecai: But that taxi's yellow.

Pops: Yellow? My taxi is no coward, I guarantee you that.

Mordecai: (sighs) Never mind. (He and Pops get ready to enter the taxi) Ready to go for a ride?

Rigby: In that thing? No way.

Mordecai: It's not even a British taxi. Come on.

Rigby: I don't care, a taxi's a taxi!

Mordecai: It'll be fun. We'll just go for a little ride.

Rigby: Uhh, I got to gotta the bathroom.

(cut to the bathroom, Rigby washes hands and pulls the toilet paper to see a tire print. Rigby is shocked as lightning strikes. Rigby looks up to the mirror to see the taxi)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(Rigby gasps and runs out of the bathroom. He goes into a dark office and pants when he stands by the door. The phone rings and Rigby grabs the phone to hear who's on the other end)

British Taxi: (over phone) Ello, gov'nor!

(Rigby gasps again and throws the phone. He turns to the sound of a fax machine printing out the words "ello gov'nor." Rigby screams and runs out, and decides to go with Mordecai and Pops)

Rigby: Let's go, let's go! (gets into the taxi) Drive!

(Pops drives out of barn)

Mordecai: What? What is it?

Rigby: That British taxi, man! It's following me!

Mordecai: Dude, come on. You're just seeing things.

Rigby: No! It was the British taxi and it was real!

Mordecai: So it came out of the movie then?

Rigby: I don't know! Maybe.

Mordecai: Alright, fine, look, you're safe now anyways. Let's just try to relax and calm down, Pops will drive us around for a bit.

Rigby: Hmph.

(fade into sometime later. Pops drives into the woods. Mordecai has fallen asleep, but Pops, although tired, still drives on)

Rigby: Wait, Pops? Where are we going?

Pops: I always drive deep into the woods when I want to clear my mind. Don't you just love the scenery?

(Rigby looks out the window at the trees. They all have evil-looking faces on them. It scares Rigby, and leaves him panting against the seat. He looks out the window again to see the British Taxi. Rigby gasps and looks back to see it driving closer and closer. He whimpers as the car suddenly stops)

Pops: Oh, bother.

Rigby: What? Why are we stopping? What's going on?

Pops: It seems we've run out of gasoline.

Rigby: Oh man, oh man, this is not good! He's coming and we're stuck here! Mordecai!

Mordecai: (Wakes up, screaming) What, what is it?

Rigby: We ran out of gas, and he's coming for me! (ducks to bottom of taxi)

Mordecai: (to Pops) Come on, we gotta get out and push. (to Rigby) Come on, Rigby.

Rigby: No! I'm not going out there!

Mordecai: Fine, Pops and I will push you all the way home then. (Him and Pops exit the taxi and start pushing it back) Geez.

Rigby: No, no, no, no, no, not back this way! (sees headlights of British taxi and gasps. They're coming closer) No, no, no, no, no! (M&P see the British taxi coming, but aren't scared)

Mordecai: Alright, help. (Rigby gets out of the taxi screaming, and runs off) Rigby! (looks back and sees that the car really is the British taxi)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

Mordecai: Holy crap, it's real! (In the UK, this line is changed to "Oh man, dudes, it's real!") Run, Pops!

(M&P run away. The British taxi runs over Pops' taxi, shattering it to pieces. Rigby's still running. M&P follow. The taxi is still chasing the three. They all jump over a log, but the British taxi keeps going and runs over the log)

Mordecai: Pops, look out! (grabs Pops in the nick of time. The taxi's still driving on. M&P watch it go) Oh no! It's going after Rigby! We gotta help him! (Pops puts his hat back on)

Mordecai and Pops: Rigby! (Rigby is still running. His tail touches the grill, almost running him over. Rigby sprints, and ends up in a dead end. The taxi comes up and corners Rigby, leading him to lean against a tree. The taxi isn't giving up)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor. (Rigby screams)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(M&P get hit by the taxi's doors, knocking them unconcious.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

Rigby: I'm no gov'nor!

(Rigby tries to run away, but bumps into a tree. The British taxi laughs evilly. Rigby opens his eyes and sees the taxi try to run him over)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor! (Rigby gets up to face the taxi)

Rigby:(furious) The name's FISTS! (smashes taxi's headlights) Leave me alone! (punches bumper and kicks grill) I hate you! (pulls doors off, bites off taxi sign, and rips off roof. Then, he walks off and smashes a tree atop the ravaged car) Stop following me around!

(cut to Mordecai and Pops holding Rigby down. Rigby's squirming)

Mordecai: Rigby! Wake up! Rigby, stop it!

Rigby: Stop... Mordecai?

Pops: Oh, thank show you're alright.

Rigby: I did it! I conquered my fear! I cleaned that taxi's clock, with my fists. 

Mordecai: Kind of, you hit your head and started going psycho on the taxi, but, actually, the taxi was a kid.

(the taxi unfolds itself to reveal that it was the employee from the video store)

Rigby: You?

Employee: Yeah, what's your problem?

Rigby: Why were you following me in that taxi suit?

Employee: (sighs. He's holding a paper) My boss made me wear this. I'm from the video store. Your rental is overdue.

Mordecai: Why didn't you just call or something?

Employee: I did, and I sent a fax!

Rigby: That was you?

Employee: Yes! So can you just return the video, please?

Rigby: We broke it.

Employee: Well, you're gonna have to pay for it.

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops?

Pops: Of course. I'm afraid the smallest bill I have is a 100. Will that do?

Employee: Yeah. Sure. (Pops hands him a lollipop, not a $100.00 bill) Is this some kind of joke? (sees Mordecai and Rigby taking Pops away) I gotta get a better job.

(Cut to the house. M&R are in bed)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Augh, not again.

Rigby: Don't worry, dude, I'm not scared again. I justThanks, dude, for helping me out with my fears and stuff.

Mordecai: No problem, man. Good night, Rigby.

Rigby: Good night, Mordecai.

(ripple transition to Rigby's dream. He's in his Fists persona, driving a car)

Fists: They say this city's pretty tough. But I'm tougher.

(It's shown that he's driving British Taxi, and he's in the sky. The car flies off towards the moon as we fade to black.)

(Episode begins with a cold open at the park house. A new character, Thomas, is knocking on the door. He then knocks again, waiting for a response.)

Thomas: Hello? (Peeks through window. As he backs away, he then notices the knob, and enters the house.) Benson, hello? (Knocks again.) Is anybody here? (Walks further in. His cell phone rings and he answers.) Hey, mom. Yeah, it's my first day at my new internship. No, I'm looking for them right now. Yeah, yeah, I met everybody yesterday and they all seem really cool. Yeah, it's gonna be a really easy way to get three credits. (Suddenly, an explosion of some sort occurs outside, shaking the house.) Mom, hold on!

(Thomas runs outside and sees a fireball explode right by the house as lasers fly past him. To the left, he sees Pops, Hi Five Ghost and Benson running in terror.)

Benson: Run! Run!

(All three are hit with lasers and stunned as Thomas watches. He then sees Skips running past the evildoers. After dodging some lasers, he is eventually shot and hits the ground. He turns to face the shooter, who has a recognizable-looking face. Muscle Man is shown watching from behind a trash can.)

Skips: You. You won't get away with--

(Skips is shot again; Muscle Man makes a break for it but is also shot down. Mordecai and Rigby are then seen running past the destruction. Mordecai is carrying a time machine, Rigby a file.)

Rigby: Dude, hurry!

Mordecai: (Mashing the buttons on the time machine.) I'm trying!

(Just as they are about to be shot, the time machine activates, and Mordecai and Rigby disappear in a golden aura. The man walks up to the house.)

GBF Jr: You should have sold it to me when you had the chance! (He blows up the house with a detonation device, laughing maniacally as a red wormhole forms above the rubble. Thomas looks on in shock. The title cards then appear.)

(REGULAR SHOW - CREATED BY JG QUINTEL - EXIT 9B - WRITTEN AND STORYBOARDED BY: CALVIN WONG, TOBY JONES - WRITTEN AND STORYBOARDED BY: ANDRES SALAFF, MADELINE QUERIPEL - SUPERVISING PRODUCER: MIKE ROTH)

(Fade to two months later. We pan down to see a new place: Skips' Place, Body and Oil Transmission.)

Skips: Let's see... Pops? (Pan through the seats, to Pops, in a zookeeper's outfit.) We got a Pops here?

Pops: Huh?

Skips: You Pops?

Pops: Indeed!

Skips: Car's ready. Sign here. (Shows Pops a clipboard and hands him a pen.)

Pops: I hope she wasn't any trouble, Mister! Mister... (Looks at nametag.) Skips.

Skips: Not really. Just an oil change.

Pops: Oh, splendid! (Runs away, laughing. Skips then looks at the clipboard again.)

Skips: We got a Marcy Stevenson here?

(Pops starts up his car, and drives out of Skips', and onto the road. He turns on the radio to listen to old-style music. At the crosswalk, Muscle Man, dressed like a college professor, checks his watch.)

Muscle Man: Come on! (Looks at the crosswalk sign. It stays on the red hand for a few seconds, before the white stick figure flashes on, Pops is seen driving, not noticing Muscle Man, only seeing him and braking at the last second.) What the heck, old man? (Pops then backs up his car, and drives away.) Hey! (Throws his briefcase at Pops' car.)

Pops: Sorry!

Muscle Man: I'll find out who you are. (Walks up to pick up his briefcase, and Hi Five Ghost appears. He is now a Pizza delivery guy.)

Hi Five Ghost: Hey mister. Do you know the way to the park?

Muscle Man: Uh, hello, I almost died. Besides, I don't have time to tell you, I'm late for my lecture on Quantam Mechanics. (leaves)

Hi Five Ghost: Pff, brainac. (He now looks at a sign that says Old Town <--, and The Park -->, and heads to the park.)

(On the park gate is a sign that reads, 'Exit 9B Coming Soon', Hi Five Ghost knocks on the gate, and Benson opens it, revealing that he still works at the park.)

Benson: You're not the usual pizza guy.

Hi Five Ghost: I'm new. That will be $12.95.

(Benson takes the pizza to GBF Jr. inside the park, which is now a construction site.)

Benson: The pizzas have arrived, sir.

GBF Jr: Excellent. Thomas, come. (We see Thomas, who was listening to music, and he runs to GBF Jr.)

Benson: Sir, do you think I could have some pizza?

GBF Jr: What? Pizza's for winners. You're not a winner, Benson, you're a slacker. NOW GET BACK TO WORK!

Benson: Yes, sir.

GBF Jr: Intern, pizza. (Opens his mouth, and Thomas feeds him a slice. He lets out an evil laugh.)

(We scroll down a little bit and Mordecai and Rigby land from the time machine.)

Mordecai: Agh, my chest.

Rigby: Are you ok?

Mordecai: Huh? (Gets up, revealing the time machine is now destroyed.) Aw, man.

Rigby: Where are we?

Mordecai: Dude, it's the park. Look. Aw man, the freeway's almost done. This is bad. Hide. (Mordecai and Rigby hide from two construction workers.) That was too close.

Rigby: What are we gonna do?

Mordecai: It's not too late. Come on, we can still fix this.

Rigby: But the space time thingy's busted.

Mordecai: We don't need it. Do you still have the document? (Rigby takes out the document that is in the file he's carrying.) All right, we have to find Skips.

(We go to Skips' garage, which is now barricaded, and now Mordecai knocks at the door.)

Mordecai: Skips! (Knocks again.) Skips?!

Rigby: (Wipes the window.) Skips! (We now look inside the garage, showing that it's all dark and full of trash.)

Mordecai: It's hopeless, dude. He's gone.

Rigby: What now? We can't pull this off without Skips.

Mordecai: There has to be a way. (Looks down.) Huh? (Picks up a card that says "Skips' Place Auto Body".)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm, hmm.

(We now go to Skips' Place, Body and Oil Transmission. Mordecai talks to a pair of legs working under a car.)

Mordecai: Hey man, you know where we can find Skips?

Skips: I'm Skips. Who's askin'?

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!

Skips: Yeah. Who are you?

Mordecai: Dude, it's us, Mordecai and Rigby.

Skips: I don't know you.

Rigby: Dude, he's been brainwashed.

Mordecai: Remember, we were co-workers at the park.

Skips: Nah, I never worked at any park.

Rigby: Do you remember that evil bearded guy? He must have scrambled your brain. He was gonna scramble our brains, too, but we escaped through a hole in space time. (Makes time traveling sound.)

Mordecai: We think about two months has past since then, now he's building a freeway on the park, our park.

Rigby: You got to help us stop him.

Skips: Exit 9B is gonna make a huge difference in people's lives. How else are people gonna get from South I-85 to Southwest 85B? You need some help with your car, I'm your guy. Otherwise, get out of here.

Rigby: That's not the Skips we know!

Skips: (Skips looms over Rigby.) I don't know you!

Rigby: Skips, you're in there somewhere, snap out of it! (He slaps Skips in the face. Skips roars in anger before pinning both Mordecai and Rigby up against the wall by their necks, choking them.)

Skips: What's your game?!

Mordecai: (choking) You gotta remember, Skips!

Skips: Who do you work for?!

Mordecai: Well, (gags) technically, you're one of our bosses? Ugh...

Skips: You lie!

Rigby: Wait, we know why your name is Skips! Remember the only woman you ever loved?!

(Skips's eyes widen as he flashes back to memories from "Diary", "The Power", "Death Punchies", "This Is My Jam", "Over the Top" and "Skips Strikes". No longer brainwashed, he lets go of Mordecai and Rigby, who fall to the ground coughing and gasping for air.)

Mordecai: Skips?

Skips: (He breathes heavily for a moment before regaining his composure. He turns to Mordecai and Rigby.) Tell me everything.

(Cuts to next scene.)

Mordecai: That bearded guy tried to take out the park out for months, but then he took it by force. And we're the only ones left who can take it back.

Skips: Uh, do we have a plan?

Mordecai: Rigby, show him the document.

Rigby: Bam! It declares the park a historical landmark. We just need everybody that worked at the park to sign it, then it will be against the law to build Exit 9B, decreed from City Hall, yo!

Mordecai: Easier said then done. If that bearded guy gave you a new identity to hide you, then there's no telling where everyone else is.

Skips: I know where we can find out.

(We cut back to the park.)

Skips: Get down. (Skips sees that the coast is clear.) Go, go!

(The trio make it into the office, where they start rifling through files.)

Rigby: There's gotta be thousands of these things.

Mordecai: Is this what we're looking for?

Skips: (Looks at the file that Mordecai found to see, and it shows all of the park worker's definitions.) Yeah, this is it. It's a case of every bodies new identities. (The file shows a picture of Benson in his new identity with his arms up and seems to look angry) Looks here like Benson's the only one who still works at the park.

(GBF Jr. tries to open the door.)

GBF Jr: Benson, why didn't you lock this door?

Benson: But, I did lock it.

GBF Jr: Oh, you locked it? I guess that's why the handle's turning. And I suppose if I push it right now, it won't open, huh? (Opens the door, but Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips are hidden.) Well, what did you know? You forgot to lock it.

Benson: I could have sworn I locked it! I won't let it happen again.

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips are seen inside the closet.)

GBF Jr: Next time it happens, you're fired. Got it? Thomas, get me some coffee.

Thomas: I'm pretty sure I saw him lock it.

GBF Jr: Nobody asked you, Thomas. I could fire you anytime I want. Just like I can fire Benson anytime I want. Isn't that right Benson? (GBF Jr. now looks at the closet door.) Why's that opened?

Rigby: (whispering) He knows. (Mordecai and Skips covers Rigby's mouth.)

GBF Jr: (He walks up close to the closet door, but only to close a file cabinet.) Break time's over. (GBF Jr., Benson, and Thomas leave and close the door. Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips come out into the office.)

(We now go to the next scene, where Pops is now a butterfly sanctuary instructor.)

Pops: Welcome to the City Butterfly Sanctuary. Admission is free, although donations are greatly appreciated.

Mordecai: (Clears his throat and holds up a lollipop.) Will you take a Butterscotch Ripple?

Pops: (Pops now has memories from "The Power", "Karaoke Video", "Prankless", "Just Set Up the Chairs", "Go Viral", "Brain Eraser", "Sugar Rush", and "The Best Burger in the World". Pops is now unbrainwashed and laughs.) I remember. Jolly good show!

(We go to Muscle Man, where he is teaching college students in an auditorium.)

Muscle Man: And as you can clearly see, C=8. Any questions? (Mordecai raises his hand.) Yes, in the back?

Mordecai: Yeah, we were just wondering, do you know who else's C=8?

Muscle Man: Well actually, yes I do. It's my mom. (Muscle Man gasps. He flashes back through memories from "Trash Boat", "Big Winner", "Slam Dunk", "Fuzzy Dice", "In the House", "Gut Model", "Muscle Mentor", and "Death Metal Crash Pit". Muscle Man is now unbrainwashed, and he rubs his hair back to its original form.) Whoooooo! (Knocks over his table.) Whoooo! Eat it, eggheads. Class is dismissed. Whooooooooo! (Smashes the exit door.) Whoooooooo!

(Back at Skips' Place, Hi Five Ghost comes to deliver a pizza. He is grabbed through the door; Muscle Man knocks the pizza box out of his hand and is about to give him a high-five.) 

Hi Five Ghost: Noooo!

(Muscle Man high fives him. Hi Five Ghost gasps, he sees memories of when he was a baby, when he was in High School, and from episodes from "My Mom", "Rage Against the TV", and "Fuzzy Dice". Hi Five Ghost is now unbrainwashed.)

Hi Five Ghost: Whooooo!

All: Yeah!

(They all sign the document.)

Muscle Man: (to Hi Five Ghost) Looks like my John Hancock's the biggest. Now give me a high five, cause I got a huge signature! (high fives Hi Five Ghost) But seriously, how do we save the park?

Mordecai: We have to get Benson's signature. The problem is he's always with that bearded guy.

Muscle Man: Who is that tool anyway?

Skips: A contractor. He's tried to buy the park countless times, so he can build a freeway there.

Pops: But why must it be the park? Why is it so important to this beard?

Skips: That doesn't matter now. What matters is that we get Benson back to sign this contract.

Hi Five Ghost: But we could get killed.

Muscle Man: Yeah. This sounds pretty heavy, bro.

Mordecai: Look, Skips is right. It might be risky, but we have to try. This isn't just the park we're talking about, it's Benson too.

Muscle Man: You're right. Let's do this thing. On three. (They all put their hands together.) One, two, three!

Mordecai Rigby Muscle Man And Hi Five Ghost: For The Park!

Pops: Jolly Good Show!

Skips: We'll Stop The Contractor!

(Short pause)

Rigby: We could have planned that better.

(Cuts backs to the park where the highway is nearly finished.)

Mordecai: All right guys, Benson could be anywhere. We just need his signature and this will all be over. Skips, you take Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost and go around back. Me, Rigby, and Pops will go that way. And remember, whatever you do, don't get caught.

Thomas: What are you guys doing here?

Muscle Man: Thomas, what's your problem? You trying to give us a heart attack?

Thomas: I have to be here. I need the credits for school. You guys gotta go: the new manager's crazy.

Mordecai: We're not leaving. You gotta tell us where Benson is, so we can get his signature.

Thomas: Uhhh..

Mordecai: Thomas!

Rigby: Thomas, where's Benson?!

Thomas: Uh, right behind you.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost get bagged by other construction workers and Benson.)

Benson: Get all of them.

(Skips and Pops get bagged as well.)

Mordecai: Benson, no! You can't do this!

(Benson snaps his fingers, and Mordecai and Rigby are the last victims to get bagged. End of Exit 9B, Part 1)

(Part 2 begins with GBF Jr. laughing maniacally. The gang of six have bags pulled from their heads and it is revealed that they are sunk neck-deep into cement at the end of a freeway ramp. Benson and Thomas stand next to GBF Jr.)

GBF Jr: Well, well, well. What've we got here? A couple of protesters trespassing on private property. What? You're not a fan of Exit 9B? Let me guess: you stuck yourself in that cement so we'll stop building, hmm? Well, I'm afraid that isn't going to work. In fact, you're one of the final components of its completion. (Laughs evilly)

(The gang struggles to get out.)

Mordecai: Dude, what's your deal?!

Muscle Man: Yeah, what's your beef with the park?

GBF Jr: Beef? I have no "beef" with the park. My "beef" is with Mordecai and Rigby!

Mordecai: Us?!

Rigby: But we don't even know you!

GBF Jr: Perhaps, not in my current form, but maybe this will jog your memory! (He struggles out to reveal he's just only a floating head, and he gives out an evil laugh once again, as everyone stuck in cement gasp in horror as well Benson and two workers.) That's right, I'm the son of universally renowed gaming champion, Garrett Bobby Ferguson: Garrett Bobby Ferguson Junior!

Mordecai: Is this just because we beat your dad's universe record?

GBF Jr: No, it's because you blew him up! You think you can just go around exploding people's dads?

Mordecai: But that wasn't our fault.

Rigby: Yeah, it was just a side-effect of getting schooled so hard!

GBF Jr: Silence! Garrett Bobby Ferguson Sr was a kind, loving father, with a heart as big as his head, and he's gone because of you.

Muscle Man: Good one, dudes.

GBF Jr: When my freeway is complete, it will be a gateway to the fiery center of the earth, and then my dad, along with everyone else you've ever destroyed, will come back from beyond the grave to destroy everything you hold dear. (laughs) And now that I have a captive audience, I present Exit 9B!

(The last part of the freeway is slotted into place. This triggers two poles with huge balls on top which zap into the dark cloud, which becomes a portal; many dozens of villains from previous episodes are seen walking out of the portal.)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro.

Rigby: This is bad.

(The villains stop marching as a giant head appears from the portal. The villains all look at it and it is revealed that it is Garrett Bobby Ferguson Sr.)

Mordecai: No way.

GBF Sr: Get ready for a universe serving of revenge.

(GBF Sr floats to GBF Jr.)

GBF Jr: Father.

GBF Sr: Son.

(They groan as they grow arms and legs. The workers in the cement make disgusted noises.)

GBF Sr: (Hugs GBF Jr.) You're looking good, son.

GBF Jr: Thanks. Now what do you say we show these park scum the meaning of revenge?

The Urge: I'm gonna enjoy this.

Hot Dog Leader: These cowards die tonight! (The guys struggle to get out.)

Rigby: It's useless. We're all gonna die!

Pops: We're surely done for!

Skips: I don't know about you guys. I think it's rude not to invite your friends to the party. (Skips whistles, summoning many allies, including The Guardians of Eternal Youth, Techmo, The God of Basketball, Gary, and Death.)

Death: 'Ello boys.

Everyone except Skips: Whoa.

Skips: Nice of you fellas to drop by.

Leader of the Guardians of Eternal Youth: Greetings, park dwellers. (The Guardians zap the cement, freeing the workers.)

GBF Jr: Huh! What, is that supposed to be an army?

GBF Sr: Huh, yeah!

Rigby: There's too many of 'em!

Hi Five Ghost: He's right. We'll never defeat them!

Mordecai: It's not about defeating them anymore! It's about standing up to them and fighting.! I for one am not just gonna hand over everything that I care about to some floating head that wants revenge on us. I'm not backing down, and I don't think you oughta back down either! (Pops nods in agreement) Today we fight! We fight for the park! (The workers cheer.) Now who's with me?! (The workers and Guardians cheer.) WHO'S WITH ME?! (Everyone cheers again.)

GBF Jr: How touching. Demon spawn of the underworld...

(The undead villains moan in compliance.)

GBF Jr: ATTACK!!!

(The undead villains charge towards the gang)

Mordecai: Hold the line... (The charge continues) Hold the line... (The charge continues) NOW!

(The gang scatters as a demolition ball flies through and smashes most of the undead back and off the ramp. A hand-to-hand fight breaks out with crude weapons.)

(Techmo Raises His Fist in the air controlling the Wrecking ball)

GBF Jr: Charge!

(The rest of the villains charge. Mordecai yells and leads a charge of his own, the protagonists and antagonists battle each other.)

(A Blonde man tries to punch Mordecai, but Mordecai knocks him out)

(The Stag-Man Is Passed out on the ground while the Hammer and the God of Basketball are in a battle as the Master Prank Caller passes by)

(God of Basketball keeps punching the Hammer and when he starts spinning his arm No Rules Man Hits him on the back with a pole then the Hammer Uppercuts God of Basketball to go flying towards Mordecai and Rigby knocking God of Basketball out)

Mordecai: Dude, we've gotta find Benson so we can get him to sign these papers.

Rigby: Let's go!

(The two run through the battle to find Benson The Game Store Manager swings his spike at Mordecai and Rigby but the two duck and Party Pete passes by Mordecai and Rigby in his Inflated Disco form and the Duck Collector also passes by too but holding a sword ready to fight. Some villains charge Skips and the Guardians.)

Skips: Now!

(The Guardians raise their rattles to the heavens, zapping down a beam of light that places the Fists of Justice onto Skips' arms. Skips knocks over several villains with one punch as the fight continues on all sides. Mordecai is seen battling Summertime Song.)

Summertime Song: Summertime lovin'--

(Mordecai smashes Summertime Song in half and he garbles his song to an end as tape spills everywhere.)

Summertime Song: Loving in the summer time (Sings in Fast Forward before dies)

Rigby: Dude, there's Benson!

Mordecai: Benson, you've been brainwashed! (Benson swings his stick at the two and they duck)

Rigby: You're on the wrong side, man.

Benson: Shut up! (collides his stick against Mordecai's)

Mordecai: We're telling the truth.

Rigby: The beard guy's evil!

(A girder on a rope flies and knocks the three off the ramp. Mordecai and Rigby land on the ground.)

Rigby: Uhhh...

Mordecai: Where'd Benson go? (screams)

(A digger appears overhead - it is being controlled by Benson. Mordecai and Rigby jump into a golf cart. Benson chases in the digger, trying to scoop them up.)

Rigby: Benson, you're the boss of the park. How do you not remember that?

Benson: Lies!

Rigby: (to Mordecai) Look out!

( Destroyer of worlds charges laser then shoots at the Gaurdians But The Lemon Chef Comes and helps the park and the baby ducks in super form also join then giant susan rises from the ground to help destroyer of worlds then  they all get mad and ready to fight to the death. Lemon chef and destroyer of worlds run up to each other trying to kill each other with their powers then crash into each other and both explode and die then the super duck and giant Susan engage in a fight but when giant Susan tries to punch super duck he ducks and throws her onto the bridge possibly killing her and she landing on a board on the bridge that the Duck collector is standing on about to kill pops with his sword as pops crawls back in fear but when giant Susan falls on one side of the board it launches the Duck Collector in the air. The bunch of Baby Ducks, in super form, see the Duck Collector flying through mid-air.)

Super Duck: Step off! (He karate chops and the Duck Collector explodes then dies.)

(No Rules Man roller blades past Skips and sprays water on his metal arms, causing them to spark and fly off his hands and explode.)

No Rules Man: No rules.(Laughs)

(Super Duck picks up No Rules Man, shuts him inside a portable potty, shakes it up, and hurls it upward, where a jet plane hits it and kills him.)

Mordecai: Benson, don't do this! The park means everything to you.

Benson: He warned me you'd try to fill my head with lies! Say goodnight.

(Benson raises the digger; Mordecai and Rigby scream. As the digger comes down, Mordecai tries to drive the cart away as he and Rigby scream "Oh!" Because they are stuck in mud, they can only do donuts instead of moving, giving Benson a flashback of Mordecai and Rigby doing donuts outside the house, annoying him. Benson grabs his head in pain and the digger stops. Mordecai and Rigby look up to see Benson deep in painful thought.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Huh?

Mordecai: (gasps), we were doing donuts. Quick, dude: hamboning.

Rigby: Ham-bon-ing! Ham-bon-ing! Ham-bon-ing!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm! Hmm! Hmm hmm! Hmm hmm! Hmm! Hmm! (climbing out of the cart) Not setting up the chairs next time! Not setting up the chairs next time!

Benson: Get.. out.. of my head!!!

Mordecai and Rigby: Whooooooaaaaaaahhhhh!

(Benson has another, longer flashback, including memories from "Just Set Up the Chairs", "Fortune Cookie", "Weekend at Benson's", "Think Positive", "Brain Eraser", "Prank Callers", "Eggscellent" (where he gets punched in the face), and "Busted Cart", and everything comes back to him when he's unbrainwashed.)

Benson: (Jumps off from the digger) Where do I sign?

(Back on the freeway, GBF Jr and GBF Sr watch the battle below going their way and you can see Broseph Chillaxton in the background about to battle the gaurdians of eternal youth and two guys from skull punch capturing muscleman and pops fighting the other one.)

GBF Jr: They're outnumbered. Soon it will all be over.

GBF Sr: I think you just got the universe record for best revenge ever!

(A bright light and noise appears above.)

GBF Jr and GBF Sr : Huh?!

(A white car flies down from the sky. Gary is driving while Mordecai, Rigby and Benson stand on the trunk.)

Benson: STOP!

(the truck lands) 

Benson: (over megaphone) This ends now!

Mordecai: That's right. Benson got his memory back and with his signature this document is complete. (holds the docment showing Benson's name added) Shut down Exit 9B and the portal!

Rigby: Decreed from City Hall, yo!

Mordecai, Rigby and Benson: Historical landmark!

(GBF Jr and GBF Sr hold each other and laugh.)

GBF Jr: They think they got everybody, Garrett Bobby Ferguson Senior!

Mordecai, Rigby and Benson: Huh?

GBF Jr: (walks to a oil drum) You had to get the signatures of all the park employees.

(GBF Jr kicks an oil drum into the air. Thomas is shown hiding underneath.)

Thomas: Huh?

Mordecai, Rigby and Benson: Thomas!

(A new signature was added in the docment)

GBF Jr: Now, hand over the document or the intern gets it. (He holds a laser gun aimed at Thomas' head.)

Benson: Why did I have to hire him right before all this happened?!

Mordecai: (sigh) This isn't his fight. (Climbing off the back of the car, Mordecai slips and loses his footing, dropping the document out of sight.) Sorry.

GBF Jr: Quit messing around and bring me the contract!

Mordecai: (Picking up a file and walking to GBF Jr.) Alright, alright.

GBF Jr: (Takes the file and laughs.) Revenge is a dish best served cold. Intern, fetch the coffee - iced!

Muscle Man: The park...

Skips: Our home.

Pops: (sheds a tear) All is lost.

GBF Jr: Thomas! Stop thinking about things and bring us the coffee already. Kid's worthless, am I right?

(Thomas screams and charges at GBF Jr, throwing the coffee at him. GBF roundhouse kicks him off the edge of the freeway.)

The workers and Gary: (shocked) Thomas!

(As Thomas falls to the ground, Gary's car swoops off after him, with Benson and Rigby still on the back. Pops, Skips and Mordecai watch over the edge.)

GBF Jr: Hmm, alright, gather round, gather round now. (The villains gather.) We'll just tear this thing up and get this war back on. Minions! Behold!

(GBF Jr holds up a crude drawing of him, thinking it's the contract.)

Blonde Man: Uh, is that a drawing of you with a butt for a face?

GBF Jr: Huh? A fake?!

Mordecai: Hey, losers!

(The car floats up from below the freeway. Thomas is clinging from the edge of the trunk.)

Rigby: Should have checked the fine print when we switched the contract in front of yo' face, know what I'm sayin'?

GBF Jr and GBF Sr: No..!

(Thomas signs the last missing spot and the paper glows yellow around his name. The contract takes off into mid air and flies to the portal, closing it. The freeway begins to crumble and crack as the villains fly back to where they came from, followed closely by the bits of destroyed freeway and - unless they can hold on, the park workers, too. The GBFs stand on the last remaining piece of freeway as terror reigns around them.)

GBF Sr: Junior. You just broke the universe record for disappointing your father. Auuuuugh! (explodes)

GBF Jr: (falls to his knees) Nooooo!!!

(GBF Jr explodes and the rest of the freeway disappears before the last remaining piece of the portal explodes, forming a mushroom cloud and when it settles the park is back to normal with green grass and blue skies. The workers stand with awe outside the now-destroyed house. Everyone except Thomas cheers.)

Mordecai: Yeah, Thomas, that was awesome!

Benson: Yeah, you're gonna make a great addition to the team.

(Everyone pats Thomas' head and rubs his shoulders.)

Rigby: Sweet job, Thomas!

Pops: Good to have you!

Thomas: Hah, thanks guys! Does... stuff like this happen all the time?

(Everyone nods and agrees.)

Benson: Don't worry, we'll have this place cleaned up in no time. Right, Skips?

Skips: Ehh, I've seen worse.

Benson: Alright everyone, let's get to it!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost get ready to drive off in the cart)

Muscle Man: Woo! Later, grandmas!

Mordecai: Thomas, we'll catch you later, right?

Thomas: Uh, yeah.

Rigby: Cool. Later, Thomas.

(Thomas is alone as his cellphone rings)

Thomas: (answering the cellphone) Hey, mom. No, no, I'm not going to quit anymore. Yeah, yeah. I think this internship's gonna be really cool.

(End of Exit 9B)

(Episode opens with Rigby starting to pull weeds)

Rigby: Pulling weeds is the worst. Who planted these weeds next to the flowers, anyway?

Old Woman: Excuse me, young man. Are you responsible for this beautiful garden?

Rigby: Pfft, yeah.

Old Woman: You must know a lot about flowers. Are you an expert?

Rigby: I'm totally an expert!

Old Woman: (In manly voice) We got an expert!

(Cameramen come out from the bushes)

Rigby: What the---

(Cameramen point cameras at Rigby. The old women unzips her costume, revealing a young man in disguise. The man kicks away the costume and eagerly begins talking.)

Bert Coleman: Yeah, that's right! I'm Bert Coleman, host of TV's hit game show: Expert or Liar! Each week I disguise myself and question people on the street to see who's an: (Text comes up on the screen, along with people shouting the words 'Expert or Liar') 

(We cut back to the park house where everybody is sitting around, watching Rigby's debut on TV. Everyone appears to be excited, except for Rigby himself, that is.)

Muscle Man: Aw, I've been waiting for this!

(We then cut back to Rigby and Bert Coleman)

Bert Coleman: Now, Rigby, you're claiming to be an expert on flowers; well, we've got ten flower-related questions for you. Answer each one correctly and you're an expert! But get just one question wrong and the world will know you're a big fat liar! First question: what color are violets? (He holds the microphone in front of Rigby's face)

Rigby: Easy. Red! No wait!

Bert Coleman: That is... incorrect! (Bert Coleman points at Rigby) You are a liar!

(The word 'Liar' appears on screen in big red letters. We then cut back to the park house again, where everyone is laughing, to Rigby's dismay. Rigby hides his face in his hands as his television debut continues.) 

(A person working for the show puts a cardboard sign over Rigby, which of course says 'Liar.' )

Anonymous Crew Member: You make me sick, liar!

(He punches Rigby, causing him to fall to the ground. Bert Coleman then bends down so he is at the same height level as the helpless raccoon.)

Bert Coleman: Flower expert? More like a big, dumb liar no one wants to hang out with.

(We cut back to the park house for a third time. Everyone is still laughing at Rigby's national screw up.) 

High Five Ghost: Classic Rigby.

Rigby: Aw, come on, stop it! What was I supposed to do, he just showed up and zipped off his face.

Muscle Man: You gotta admit, he got you good, liar.

Rigby: I'm not a liar! I may not be an expert on flowers, but I'm an expert at something.

Mordecai: Whatever.

High Five Ghost: Yeah, right.

(He and the rest of the park crew walk away, leaving Rigby to sit by himself on the couch)

Rigby: I'm gonna get back on that show, and then you'll see how much of an expert I am. You'll all see!

(A clock transition shows Rigby at the snack bar, stuffing nachos and cheese sauce into a green backpack. He starts to put in even more snacks as Mordecai enters.)

Mordecai: Dude, you don't have to do this, you know.

Rigby: I have to! That jerk Bert Coleman made a fool out of me.

Mordecai: How are you even gonna find him? He's always in disguise.

Rigby: Easy. His costumes are really lame. I just gotta find the weirdest looking person, pull their weirdo face off, then BAM! I go back on TV and prove I'm an expert.

Mordecai: Dude, that's the worst plan ever.

Rigby: I don't care! Nobody ever takes me seriously, and I'm sick of it! I'm going after Bert Coleman and I'm not coming back until I find him, so don't wait up!

(A clock transition shows Rigby walking through town, trying to find somebody that might possibly be Bert Coleman. He approaches an old man that appears to be having trouble with a map.)

Old Man: Excuse me, sonny, could you help me read this map?

Rigby: Maps? Yes, I'm a map expert.

Old Man: Oh, wonderful.

Rigby: I'm also an expert at finding you, Bert Coleman!

Old Man: Bert who?

(Rigby then tries to pull the man's face off, leading to a montage of several failed attempts to find Bert Coleman. He ends up attacking a mime, yelling at an ice cream man, frightening a couple making out on a bench, bothering a construction worker, looking into a horse's mouth, and even fighting with Bloodshed and Manslaughter, who fight back. Rigby is then seen walking around with a black eye and angrily eating food. He looks at a billboard that is advertising Expert or Liar, the camera zooming in to the word 'liar.')

Rigby: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... (Screams dramatically) BERT COLEMAAAAAAAAN!!!

(Back at the park, Benson is seen walking into the snack bar. He is surprised at the amount of chips left in the nacho container and pulls out a tape measure to satisfy his suspicions.)

Benson: Oh no, no, no! These are not optimum chip levels! Mordecai, what did I tell you about hoarding snacks?

Mordecai: It wasn't me, it was Rigby!

Benson: Where is he?

Mordecai: He's not here. He got humiliated on national television for lying and now he's trying to get back on the show to redeem himself. You know, typical Rigby.

(Benson suddenly stops to think about what Mordecai said)

Mordecai (continued): Benson?

Benson: Did you say he was humiliated on a TV show?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Benson: I have to go. (He exits the snack bar)

(We skip to much later at night. Rigby is sleeping on a bench, mumbling about Bert Coleman in his sleep. Suddenly, a vehicle pulls up, its headlights shining over Rigby's body. A shadow is then seen looming over Rigby.)

(Right as he opens his eyes. Rigby is eventually shaken awake by none other than Benson.)

Rigby: Benson? Where am I?

Benson: My apartment. (He hands Rigby a bowl of soup) Here, eat this. You look terrible.

Rigby: (Takes a sip of the soup) Why are you being so nice to me?

Benson: Look, Rigby, I know we don't always see eye to eye, but we do have one thing in common. (He sighs and holds up a tape) I, too, was humiliated on national television.

(He puts the tape in his VCR. A much younger Benson with short brown hair and glasses is shown standing in front of a microphone, waiting for the show to come back onto the air. A game announcer walks up, ready to ask Benson the final question.)

Game Announcer: And now back to: (Text comes up on the screen, along with people yelling 'Say That Word!') Benson, you've made it to the final round. Say that word, and you'll win a hundred thousand dollars! 

Young Benson: (Runs around in circles) Woohoo! A hundred thousand! (He quickly pulls himself together again)

Game Announcer: What will you do with that money?

Young Benson: Quit my dumb job at the park!

Game Announcer: You work at a park? Sounds awful! Now, let's see that final word! (The word bandana appears in front of Benson) Alright, Benson: say that word!

Young Benson: BANANA! (His excited expression quickly fades when he hears a buzzer)

Game Announcer: Oh, I'm sorry Benson, the word is bandana. Not quite sure how you missed that one. (The camera zooms in on the word 'bandana') I mean, there it is: bandana! You just had to say that word. (Mutters) I thought we screen people to make sure they know how to read.

(To add insult to injury, a woman ties a plain white bandana around Benson's neck that says 'loser.' Right after this happens, all of Benson's hair fall out, leaving him to scream 'No!' as static overtakes the screen.)

Rigby: Whoa. Brutal.

Benson: (He puts a hand on his forehead) The mockery. The scorn. For years, I couldn't leave the house without someone handing me a banana. I would never wish that kind of pain on anyone. Not even you.

Rigby: Thanks, Benson. I just need to get back on that show and prove I'm an expert at something.

Benson: Expert, huh? Well, I think we both know what you're best at.

(Rigby and Benson both shout a different answer at the same time)

Benson: Slacking off!

Rigby: Sandwiches!

Benson: Wait, what?

Rigby: Yeah, man, sandwiches! Meat, bread, condiments, what else you need to know?

Benson: Alright, let's go with sandwiches.

Rigby: But how are we gonna find Bert Coleman?

Benson: Let me handle that.

(A clock transition shows Benson addressing everybody in front of the park house)

Benson: Alright, listen up! Today I have a special task for all of you. Go to all the sandwich shops in town-

Muscle Man: (Interrupts) Aw, yes! 

Benson: -and find Bert Coleman for Rigby.

(Everbody starts complaining)

Mordecai: Aw, what?

Muscle Man: Why should we help that liar? He's the one that got himself into this mess.

Benson: (Points at Muscle Man) That may be. But think of all the times his lying got you out of messes. (He points at Mordecai) Mordecai, who lied to get you out of your chores countless times? (He points at Pops) Or when Pops broke that vase. Who lied to Mr. Maellard and told him a bird did it? (He points at Muscle Man) And Muscle Man... (The camera shows a close up of Benson's face) How many times did you get Rigby to lie to Starla because you weren't man enough to do it yourself?

Muscle Man: (Crosses his arms) Point made, bro.

Thomas: Actually, my friend Cody's an intern on Expert or Liar. He might be able to tell us where Bert Coleman will be.

Muscle Man: Geez, Thomas, why didn't you say so sooner?

Benson: Alright, then. Rigby and I will talk to this intern. As for the rest of you: start searching those sandwich shops or you're all fired!

(The next scene starts with Benson opening a drawer of a file cabinet. Thomas, Rigby, and Cody are standing eagerly behind him, waiting to see what he'll find.)

Benson: Thanks again, Cody.

Cody: Anything for Thomas.

Benson: (Rifling through the files) Okay, let's see. (The camera zooms in to show the message on the front of the drawer which says: "Expert or Liar" Upcoming Episodes A-Z) Swim dancing, scuba diving, sword fighting... nope. No episodes about sandwiches. Wait a minute. (He pulls out a file) It says here that Bert Coleman will be at an arcade tomorrow. That's kind of your thing, right Rigby?

Rigby: Of course! Video games! If there's anything I'm a true expert at, it's that! Man, who would have thought skipping work to play video games would finally pay off?

Benson: Uh, yeah. We'll deal with that later. (Points at Rigby) For now, we gotta get you ready.

Cody: It won't be that easy. Expert or Liar doesn't allow repeat guests.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. I got an idea.

(We skip to the next day. A kid is playing Super Donkey Bros. when a short, stout man approaches him.)

Short Man: Hey, buddy, that's a pretty high score. Are you an expert at video games?

Kid: Yeah, I'm an expert.

Short Man: We got an expert! (The short man unzips his costume, once again revealing Bert Coleman. His camera crew runs over as he starts talking.) 

Burt Coleman: Surprise, I'm Bert Coleman, and you're on Expert or Liar!

Kid: Well, I've got a surprise for you, Bert Coleman.

(The kid unzips his costume, revealing a well-disguised Rigby.)

Rigby: We meet again! Now put me back on the show, Bert!

Bert Coleman: We don't do repeat guests. Get out of here, liar!

Rigby: No! I'm here to stand up for myself, and everyone else out there who's been humiliated on television!

Joe: That's right. My name's Joe, and they made a fool out of me on Pull My Finger.

Anonymous: They got me on I Kissed Your Wife!

Anonymous: Pie in the Face!

Benson: (Steps out from behind a game console) And I was humiliated on Say That Word.

Anonymous: Hey, it's Banana! (A banana hits Benson on the back of the head) 

Benson: Urrrrrrrrrrrragh. (Sighs) Put him back on the show, Bert.

Bert Coleman: You want a second chance, huh? Well, I have something real special for you. It's our season finale, and we're broadcasting live! (Bert picks up Rigby and shoves him up against a camera) Say hello to the folks at home.

(Back at the park house)

Skips: He's in for it now.

(Back at the arcade)

Bert Coleman: And that's not all. If you lose, we'll rerun this episode every day as long as this show's on the air. Which will be a long time 'cause our ratings are really good. So what do you say?

Rigby: Bring on the questions.

Bert Coleman: To the gaming center!

(A video-game like background appears behind Bert Coleman, featuring elements such as platforms and ladders. A pixelated audience appears, watching in anticipation.)

Bert Coleman: You must answer ten questions about video games. Each correct answer will move you ahead in the obstacle course. Let the game, begin!

(The platform underneath Bert Coleman raises up, taking the game announcer for a ride)

Bert Coleman: First question: How much lemonade takes you to the final level of Lemonade Stand?

(Four lemons and a pitcher of lemonade appear behind Bert Coleman. Bert sends a lemon tumbling down towards Rigby, which he dodges. Rigby then runs up a steel girder.)

Rigby: I know this! (He hoists himself up onto a ladder when another lemon comes towards him) Sixteen pitchers!

Bert Coleman: That is... correct! (The lemonade pitcher behind him disappears) Name the two main characters in Xtreme Xcape.

(The two main characters appear and try to hit Rigby with their guns. Rigby dodges their attacks, however.)

Rigby: Hairowitz! (The blond character disappears) Afroski! (The other character disappears)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Rigby scampers up a ladder and advances to the next level. Bert Coleman rides up on his platform, making three pixelated basketballs hover over his fingertips.)

Bert Coleman: The secret move in Hoop Jams 5000 is... (He throws the basketballs at Rigby)

Rigby: Triple Double Hand Combo! (The basketballs stop right in front of him and disappear)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Rigby crawls up another ladder to come face to face with two big, buff dudes. He doesn't even need to be asked a question, this time.)

Rigby: John and John from Strong Johns!

(The two characters immediately dissolve into pixelated nothingness)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

Rigby: The Hammer's weakness is furniture! (He bashes the eight bit character over the head with a chair)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

Rigby: Left, right, AB, AB, start! (He deflects a fireball right back into the Destroyer of Worlds's face, causing the eight bit demon to explode)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

Rigby: (Jumps onto a ladder) The Maximum Glove! (The glove flashes red and explodes)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Giant fruit comes flying towards Rigby)

Rigby: Shikara Yama Shi-to! (He eats a banana, giving him a boost of energy)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Rigby quickly jumps from girder to girder as Bert Coleman asks him another question, the camera panning up to Bert as he finishes asking it)

Bert Coleman: In Dig Champs, how fast are the giant slugs?

(A giant slug appears in front of Rigby)

Rigby: Trick question. They're giant snails! 

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(The giant slug turns into a giant snail and breaks through the girder. Rigby quickly climbs up two more ladders, only to end up hanging on for dear life as he reaches a final, spinning girder.)

Bert Coleman: Last question: Who holds the universe record in the game: Broken Bones?

(A giant Garrett Bobby Ferguson forms below Rigby and starts laughing)

(Back at the park house, everyone gasps in shock, and Benson looks on worriedly at Rigby from his place in the arcade)

Rigby: (He barely manages to hold onto the girder) It was... Garrett... Bobby... Ferguson!

Bert Coleman: Wrong! (Laughs) LIAR!

Rigby: I said he was. Until the record was broken by Mordecai and me! And I did it because I'm an EXPERT!

(Rigby jumps up and punches Bert off of his platform, leaving him to fall into the pixelated GBF's mouth. After swallowing him, the video pixelated Garrett Bobby Ferguson yells 'No!' and explodes. Rigby hops up onto Bert Coleman's platform.)

Rigby: IN YO FACE! (A giant eight bit version of himself appears behind him, along with the word 'Expert!')

(Benson happily eats a banana, and the video game audience cheers)

(Back at the park house, eveyone's cheering for Rigby)

Mordecai: He did it! He actually did it!

Pops: Oh, good show! Hahahaha!

Mordecai: Good thing he didn't go with sandwiches, am I right guys?

High Five Ghost: Sandwiches? Oh, no! Where's Muscle Man?

(We cut to Muscle Man yanking on some innocent bystander's burger costume) 

Muscle Man: Take off the bun, Bert! Take off the bun!

(End of Expert or Liar)

(The episode starts at The Coffee Shop with Rigby and Eileen playing cards, and Margaret serves Mordecai his coffee)

Margaret: Here you go. This one's on the house.

Mordecai: Thanks.

Margaret: Hey, are you doing anything tomorrow? My family is having a barbecue. Wanna come?

Rigby: Family function?! Pass. I can't stand my own family barbecues, Why would I want to go to someone else's?

Mordecai: (Elbows Rigby) She's not talking to you!

Margaret: Um. So, how 'bout it? Hehe.

Mordecai: Sure. Sounds like fun.

Margaret: Awesome! I'm really excited for you to meet everybody, especially my dad. I think you'll really like him. He pilots the traffic Helicopter for the local news.

Rigby: What?!

Mordecai: Whoa! Your dad is Chopper Six?!

Rigby: That dude rules! (Imitates "Chopper Six") Psh! This is Chopper Six now flying over a ton of traffic. Bet all of you losers wish you were in this Chopper! (Imitating stops) WHOO! And then he flies over some burning truck in a fifty car pile up! So cool.

Eileen: He is really cool, but don't let your guard down. Margaret's dad can be a pretty aggressive guy. It's common in such a male dominant profession. He even refuses to shake hands with any guy Margaret brings home.

Margaret: Oh, come on! He's not that tough. He's super sweet when you get to know him.

Mordecai: Yeah. I'm sure we'll get along fine.

Margaret: Well, we gotta get back to work. I'll pick you up tomorrow, okay? (Margaret and Eileen leave)

Eileen: Later.

Mordecai: Great. See ya. (To Rigby) I have to shake that guy's hand.

Rigby: What, why?

Mordecai: Dude, it's a huge deal! I'm finally out of the friend zone, and now she's taking me to meet her parents.

Rigby: So what? You wanna date Margaret, not her dad.

Mordecai: You don't get it, dude. If Margaret and I are gonna date, I need her dad to like me. I have to get that handshake.

(The setting changes to the Smith's house and the whole family is having fun)

Denise: Margaret! Margaret!

Margaret: Hey mom.

(She hugs Denise)

Denise: So good to see you.

Margaret: Mom, this is Mordecai.

Denise: (Shakes Mordecai's hand) Hi Mordecai. I'm Denise. Margaret's told us so much about you.

Mordecai: Oh. Hehe. I hope good things.

Denise: Well, she mentioned something about you wearing a diaper.

Mordecai: Uh...

Margaret: Mom!

Denise: Oh, I'm teasing. (Laughs) Mordecai, let me introduce you to the family. We have Margaret's cousins, Ricky, Tommy, Marcie, Robby, Ronnie, Susie, Stacey, you know John.

John: Sup, Mordo.

Denise: Uncle Tim, Uncle Dave, Uncle Bill, Aunt Theresa, Aunt Mary Beth, Aunt Kathleen, Nana Smith, Grandpappy Jack, and over by the grill is Margaret's--.

Margaret: Daddy!

Frank: Is that my little hug-bug? Give me a hug, hug-bug.

(Margaret and her dad excitedly hug)

Margaret: Daddy! (Laughing)

Frank: Aw, look at you so grown up. How am I gonna hug my hug-bug if I can't even recognize her?

Margaret: Dad, I was here last weekend!

Frank: Hey, you bring that mix tape I let you borrow? Daddy's gotta have his rockin' tunes for Chopper Six.

Mordecai: Whoa. Hehe. What a coincidence. I love rockin tunes too.

(He laughs nervously. Frank scowls at him angrily)

Margaret: Daddy, this is Mordecai.

Mordecai: (Raises his hand to let Frank shake it) Nice to meet you, sir.

(Short silence)

Frank: This the diaper guy?

Mordecai: Uh--.

Frank: I better rustle up some more burgers on the grill, put some meat on diaper guy's bones here.

Mordecai: You told him, too?

Margaret: Oh relax. He's just messing around. That's when you know he likes you.

(Frank flips a hamburger while scowling at Mordecai)

Mordecai: I got to get that handshake.

(Music plays while Frank flips a hamburger. He tries to squeeze sauce on to it but cannot. He looks into the bottle and notices that it is empty. He walks away to get more. After this, Mordecai flips it a few times, then flips it backwards and it lands in Nana Smith's burger bun. People start clapping, then Frank walks onscreen. Mordecai puts his hand out to shake Frank's hand. but he just takes the spatula and walks away. Then, we see some of Margaret's cousins trying to get a rugby ball out of Frank's hand while Frank holds it in the air. He puts it on the ground. John kicks it and the rugby ball flies through the air, along with his wooden leg. Mordecai manages to catch them both. John and Frank take the ball and the leg. Mordecai puts his hand out again, but the two walk away. Then we see one of Margaret's uncles eating a hot dog when he starts choking on a piece. Mordecai runs up and perfroms the heimlich, causing the piece to come back out and hit Frank. Margaret, Denise and Frank walk over. Mordecai goes to shake Frank's hand, but he just gives him the hot dog piece. The uncle who originally choked on it takes it back and eats it. The music stops.)

(We see some people swimming, and the scene changes to Mordecai, Margaret and Frank.)

Margaret: I'm gonna swim for a bit. You coming?

Mordecai: (Sips lemonade) Oh, I didn't bring a swim suit.

Frank: Why don't you ask little Susie to borrow a swim diaper?

(Susie laughs)

Margaret: Daddy!

Frank: Alright, alright. I've got a suit he can wear.

(Scene changes to a room in Margaret's house. Frank is going through a drawer to find the suit.)

Mordecai: (Looking at pictures) Wow. You guys really spend a lot of time together.

Frank (offscreen): Here. (Throws a strange suit at Mordecai)

Mordecai: Ummm... Why is the front like that?

Frank: That's the back.

Mordecai: Maybe I'll... skip the pool.

Frank: Skip the pool? What are you, ashamed of your body or something?

Mordecai: What? No! I-

Frank: A real man does not get ashamed. Pathetic. Here. Just give it back. I'll wear it.

Mordecai: No! I'll wear it.

Frank: Oh! You think you can handle it?

Mordecai: Yeah. Pfffft. It's cool. Not a problem.

Frank: Good. (Walks out)

(Mordecai walks outside. Once he gets out, everyone stops talking. Mordecai walks past Susie and she cries. The uncle who choked on the hot dog chokes again when Mordecai walks past him. We then see the back, and Mordecai's buttcheeks are showing. He walks up to Margaret, Denise and Frank.)

Margaret: Umm...

Denise: Oh, Frank, I thought you threw that suit out.

Frank: Hey, I tried to stop him, but the kid wanted to wear it.

Mordecai: You said this was what a real man would wear!

Frank: I don't know what you're talking about.

Mordecai: But...

Frank: You calling me a liar?!

Mordecai: No, no. It's fine. Really! Thanks for the suit, Frank.

(He raises hand for Frank to shake.)

Frank: It's Mr. Smith to you, and get that thing away from me.

(Walks away)

Mordecai: Ugh.

Darrell: You're trying to get a handshake from Old Man Frank?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Darrell: He's a tough nut-to-crack. There is one way he'll shake your hand. (Looks around and takes off his goggles) You'll have to beat him at a cannonball contest.

Mordecai: What?

Darrell: He's the best cannonballer around. Really respects the craft, you know? He'll shake the hand of anyone who can cannonball better than him.

Mordecai: Hmm hmm. (Walks up to Frank) Hey Mr. Smith. I heard you are pretty good at cannonballs.

Frank: Yeah, only the best around.

Mordecai: How about a little contest?

Frank: You're challenging me to a cannonball contest in my own home?!

(Everyone mummers)

Mordecai: Uh...

Frank: Recess is over, skin and bones. It's cannonball time.

(Scene circle-wipes to the cannonball contest where Frank goes first.)

Frank: Cannonball!

(He runs to the pool and jumps into it, doing a cannonball as everyone cheers at him and he gets out of the pool.)

Frank: Beat that, small fry!

(Mordecai turns and walks into the house)

Frank: Ha! Quitting! Just as I thought.

Mordecai: Cannonball!

(He runs to the pool and jumps into it, doing a big cannonball as everyone cheers on him, including Margaret. Frank gets on a diving board.)

Frank: Cannonball!

(He runs and jumps off the diving board and into the pool, doing a bigger cannonball as everyone cheers on him again. Mordecai climbs up the ladder of another diving board)

Mordecai: Cannonball!

(He runs and jumps off the diving board and into the pool, doing a biggest cannonball as everyone cheers on him again. Frank presses a button which activates another diving board on the roof. Mordecai is shocked at this. Margaret sighs and places her hand on her head. Frank climbs up the ladder of the diving board)

Frank: Cannonball!

(He runs and jumps off the diving board and into the pool, doing a large cannonball as water from the pool splashes on Mordecai's face. He runs on the diving board of a treehouse and jumps off of it.)

Mordecai: (in slow-motion) Cannonball!

(He does a larger cannonball as the pool water splashes on the grill, the punch bowl and Frank as everyone cheers on Mordecai again.)

Margaret: Alright, Mordecai!

Frank: Had enough, diaper boy?

Mordecai: You kidding? I can cannonball all day.

Frank: Is that so? But can you do a mannonball?

Mordecai: A what?

Frank: (grabs a walkie talkie) Fred, bring Chopper Six around. It's mannonball time.

(Chopper Six arrives and lands in the front yard.)

Denise: Frank, come on! Just let it go!

Frank: Stay out of it, Denise! This is mannonball business! I'm gonna put this punk in his place!

Mordecai: We'll See about that!

Margaret: Wait, Dad! Come on!

(Frank and Mordecai get on Chopper Six as it flies up into the sky)

Margaret: Ugh, he always does this stuff!

Denise: You know your father. Always thinking with his chopper. But that's why I love him.

(Chopper Six flies above to where the pool is.)

Frank: That's a 50-foot drop. You mess this up, it's gonna take more than a pool boy to clean it up. You ready to call it quits?

Mordecai: No.

Frank: Have it your way. Fred, more altitude! And dont be afraid to shake things up!

Fred: Roger that!

(Fred moves the chopper up higher as Mordecai looks down at the view and gulps. Birds fly by.)

Frank: Its time to give up, skin and bones! You're out of your element.

Mordecai: I'm not giving up! I'm winning this cannonball contest!

Frank: (groans) Fred, take us higher!

Fred: But Frank, she's not stabled!

Frank: DO IT NOW!!!

(Fred moves the chopper up way higher as Mordecai looks down at the view again.)

Frank: Give up! You can't win this!

Mordecai: What's your deal, man?! I only did this contest, because I wanted you to like me!

Frank: It's not about the contest, it's about losing my baby girl!

Mordecai: What?

Frank: Margaret's grown up so fast. Every time she brings one of you yahoos to the house, I'm afraid you're gonna take her away from me. I can't lose my hug-bug!

Mordecai: Dude, Margaret thinks you're the greatest dad ever! She's always talking about how great you are. No matter what happens, you're always gonna be her dad! She loves you, man!

Frank: Fred, take us down.

Fred: The winds are to strong! I'm losing her!

(As the winds start to spin Chopper Six, Frank looses his balance and falls off the chopper.)

Mordecai: Mr. Smith!

(He grabs a parachute and jumps off the chopper to save Frank.)

Mordecai: I'm coming, Mr. Smith!

(As Frank continues to fall, Mordecai arrives in time and grabs him.)

Frank: What are you doing?!

Mordecai: Saving you!

Frank: Why?! I treated you like garbage!

Mordecai: It doesn't matter! The only thing I care about is Margaret! And she cares about you, so hold on!

(He opens the parachute, which rips out of his back due to the wind. He screams)

Frank: Well, that's it. We're gonna die.

(They continue to fall as the family, Margaret and Denise are watching.)

Mordecai: I'm sorry about all this!

Frank: Hey, at least you tried. Not a lot of guys would risk their lives like that. You got guts, kid.

(Mordecai smiles as they are getting closer to the pool.)

Frank: It was nice knowing you, Mordecai.

(He raises hand for Mordecai to shake, and Mordecai places his hand on Frank's hand, finally getting his handshake.)

Mordecai: You too, Mr. Smith.

Frank: Hey, call me Frank.

Mordecai: Thank you, Fran

(They land in the pool, creating an enormous explosion, then it fades away, leaving the entire backyard a huge mess.)

Darrell: Best mannonball ever!

(Scene cuts to the hospital where Mordecai and Frank, covered in body casts and still holding their hands, are lying in bed with their front bodies.)

Margaret: Will they be alright, Doctor?

Doctor: Oh, they'll be fine. If that handshake hadnt broken their fall, they'd be dead. We'll be able to separate them in about six weeks. (chuckles)

(Rigby comes in the room)

Rigby: Dude, Mordecai, I heard what happened! So awesome! I wanna jump out of Chopper Six next! (chanting) Mannonball, mannonball, mannonball!

Frank: You know this bozo?

Mordecai: Nope.

(End of "Family BBQ")

(The episode begins with Muscle Man and Starla sitting on a park bench. Muscle Man chews a piece of gum and spits it out on a wrapper before placing it on the ground. A speedwalker is then shown coming up.)

Muscle Man: Oh, it's on.

(Pulls out popcorn bag) 

Muscle Man: Time to bust out the popcorn, baby.

(Starts eating some of it)

(The speedwalker steps onto the gum-covered wrapper as Muscle Man laughs at what he just did)

Muscle Man: Why aren't you laughing, babe? You always laugh when we go on dates!

Starla: Mitch, we have to talk.

(MM&S get up from the bench as Muscle Man wonders what Starla is about to say)

Starla: I've been thinking. We need to take our relationship to the next level. My parents are in town tonight, and I think you should meet them over dinner!

(MM&S grab each other's hands)

Muscle Man: Whoa, seriously? Babe, that's a huge step!

(Dips her) 

Muscle Man: And I already know the perfect place: Wing Kingdom.

Starla: Uh, I don't think you should take my parents to Wing Kingdom. (Muscle Man frowns as Starla gives her opinion) I have another place in mind.

(Mini montage of a fancy-looking restaurant. First, we see a chandeleir. Then, we cut to a man sitting at a table with a cup of tea. He raises his pinky finger and takes a sip. Next, we cut to a woman with a napkin. She raises her pinky fingers from off the napkin and then wipes her upper lip. We are then shown a sign that reads: No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service. Muscle Man looks through the window, dismayed.)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro.

(To Starla) 

Muscle Man: Uh, are you sure about this place?

Starla: Yeah! This is the best place to make an impression. I really want my parents to like you.

Muscle Man: Sure. Then, let's go here, babe.

Starla: (Kisses Muscle Man) I'm so excited for my parents to meet you! (Gasps) I have so much to do!

(Runs off)

(Clock transition to the kitchen of Pops's house. Muscle Man is making a reservation as Mordecai and Rigby walk in.)

Muscle Man: I'd like to make a reservation.

(M&R notice what's going on) 

Muscle Man: Yeah. Sorrenstein, party of four, seven o'clock p.m.

Maitre'd: Oui, <Yes,> Mr. Sorrenstein, we will see you tonight at seven. Now, we do have a strict dress code.

Muscle Man: (Begins sweating profusely) Dress code?

Maitre'd: Oui. <Yes.> Black tie, jacket...

Muscle Man: (M&R look on) Jacket? I think I might have a windbreaker.

Maitre'd: (Angrily) What?! Did I mention a shirt and shoes are required as well?!

Muscle Man:  Uh... Of course not; I know that! Now, this is totally a joke question, but that shirt has to be clean too, right?

Maitre'd:  What?! Well, I never!

(Cut back to kitchen. Maitre'd is yelling over the phone.)

Muscle Man: (Frightened) See you at seven!

(Quickly hangs up phone, panting)

Rigby: Lemme guess, Bistro en Le Parc?

Muscle Man: Yeah. I have to meet Starla's parents there tonight.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa, takin' it to the next level!

Muscle Man: Yeah, but didn't you hear that? I barely made it through the reservation! How am I gonna impress Starla's parents if I can't even make a reservation?

Mordecai: Dude, just be yourself.

Muscle Man: I can't be myself! Myself sucks! Starla will totally dump me if her parents don't like me.

Rigby: We'll help you get fancy for your dinner.

Muscle Man: Really, dudes?

Mordecai: Yeah, man. We're your friends. We hate to see you bummed out.

Rigby: Plus, last time Starla dumped you, you got all sad and we had to do your work.

Muscle Man: (Laughs) Yeah. Sure glad I'm not you guys. Where do we start?

Mordecai: Not we.

(Cut to Pops's room, where Pops is standing)

Mordecai (continued): He.

(Zoom out)

Pops: (Laughs) I'm so happy that you decided to become fancy, Muscle Man. And, you want me to help! I even wrote a book about it! (Puts a book on the table, titled:) Fanciness, Theory and Practical Application. (Opens book) A practical application of advanced theory of fanciness.

(MR&MM slowly back out) 

Pops: Volume one of six. First printing, published, M-C-M-X, V-I-I...

(Mordecai closes the door)

Mordecai: Dude, we're gonna have to do this our way.

Muscle Man: Good. 'Cause I don't know if I can handle having to listen to Pops speak Spanish anymore.

(Clock transition to a montage of Muscle Man learning fanciness. Mordecai holds up a book called: "Etiquette for Very Young Children," and opens the book to step 1, "A firm handshake." Outside, Mordecai raises his arm for Muscle Man to shake, but Muscle Man clumsily pounds it from the top and bottom, then realizes he did it wrong. Next, they practice step 2, "Open the door for guests." Muscle Man opens the door for Rigby to walk through, but quickly runs in through the doorway, slamming the door in front of Rigby. Rigby facepalms before they practice step 3, "Seat your guests." Muscle Man at first does it right when Rigby sits in the chair, but pushes it in too hard.)

(We then use a clock transition to Muscle Man learning how to use the forks in the kitchen. Mordecai holds up a sign that tells Muscle Man to pick up the salad fork. Muscle Man then picks up the fork to his farthest left. M&R nod in approval, and Muscle Man smiles, as we clock transition to the Awkward and Oblong men's store. We end the montage with Muscle Man coming out of a dressing booth, dressed in a tuxedo, and his hair held back with gel.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Mordecai: Dude! You look like a whole new man!

Rigby: How do you feel?

Muscle Man: Fancy.

(The tuxedo falls apart, and the gel fails to hold Muscle Man's hair back) 

Muscle Man: I can't do this!

Mordecai: We're gonna need a plan B. (To Rigby) Rigby, you still got those mini-headsets?

(Clock transition to the front of Bistro En Le Parc at nighttime. Muscle Man's dressed in his tuxedo again, receiving instruction from M&R.)

Muscle Man: (Into headseat) Testing, testing. I don't know if I can do this, guys.

(Pan over to the window. Mordecai and Rigby, also dressed in tuxedos, are instructing Muscle Man, the former in a fake moustache, the latter in glasses.)

Mordecai: Dude, don't worry. We got this.

(Cut to inside) 

Mordecai: Me and Rigby are already inside.

Rigby: Just stick to the plan. Everything will be alright.

(Cut back to outside)

Muscle Man: Thanks, dudes. I--

(A car horn blares, and headlights shine on Muscle Man. He looks back and sees Starla and her parents, dressed in formal attire, coming out of the car)

Starla: (Waving) Mitch! Mitch!

Muscle Man: (As Starla and her parents approach) Whoa! Babe! You look totally ho-- (Starla frowns) ...uh, lovely!

Starla: Mitch... (Pans over to her parents) these are my parents.

(Short silence)

Rigby: (Over headset) Shake their hands.

Muscle Man: (Shaking the father's hand) Mitch Sorrenstein.

Herb: Charmed. I am Sir Herbert Gotzmendoder. (Introduces wife) And this is my wife, Madame Rose Gotzmendoder.

Rose: (Raises hand) How do you do?

(Muscle Man kisses her hand)

Muscle Man: Let's go inside, shall we?

(They walk toward the door)

Rigby: (Over headset) Dude, get the door!

(Muscle Man runs and open the door for them)

Maitre'd: Welcome to Bistro en Le Parc.

Muscle Man: Sorrenstein. Table for Four.

Maitre'd: I hope Monseur (You) found a clean shirt.

Muscle Man: (Laughs) You know it, Bro.

Maitre'd: Yes. Your table awaits.

(He turns to whisper to another waiter)

Maitre'd: Keep an eye on them.

Rigby: (Over headset) Dude, pull out the chair for Starla.

(Muscle Man pulls out the chair for Starla, and Herb pulls out the chair for Rose)

Rigby: You're up, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Showtime.

Starla: Oooo...

Mordecai: Ah... If it isn't Mr. Sorenstein. Are you ready to order, Sir?

Muscle Man: Uh...

Rigby: Muscle Man, you're supposed to order for the table.

Muscle Man: Oh right. The ladies will have the lobster, and the gentleman will have the (Mispronouncing) filet mignon. I mean, if the ladies and gentleman are cool with that.

Both: Indeed.

Mordecai: Excellent choice, sir.

Muscle Man: And here's a little something for yourself. Make sure things are extra fancy.

(All laugh)

Mordecai: (Whispering to Muscle Man) Put your napkin in your lap.

Muscle Man: Oh, right.

(Muscle Man puts his napkin in his lap)

(Mordecai walks away)

Mordecai: (To Rigby) You're up.

Rigby: Okay, Muscle Man, get ready for some fancy conversation topics.

Muscle Man: (Fake chuckle)

Rigby: How are you two enjoying-

Muscle Man: The weather? Um... because I think it's uh... nice lately.

Both: Indeed.

Muscle Man: Uh... so what do you uh... do? Uh... I work full-time in park, uh... management.

Rose: Oh.

Both: Indeed.

Muscle Man: Yeah, I'm just lucky I get to do what I love, which is basically just mowing the lawn topless.

Mordecai: Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Hot salads coming through. Cool it with the topless talk. Here's your salad, sir.

Muscle Man: Salad? I love salad; I eat it frequently. Let's dig in, shall we?

Rigby: (Over headset) FORK, FORK! USE YOUR FORK!

Muscle Man: Uh...

Both: Salad fork!

(Muscle Man picks up the salad fork. Mordecai and Rigby sigh in relief)

(Muscle Man chews slowly, is given chocolate pie with whipped cream, cleans his face with a napkin, and makes a rousing toast)

Muscle Man: To which I replied: "My mom".

(All laugh again)

Starla: Hey, this is going so well. They really like you.

Mordecai: He did it! He got through the whole meal!

Rigby: Wait, who's that?

Maitre'd: Your dessert, sir.

Muscle Man: Huh? Uh... you're not our waiter.

Maitre'd: Oh no, your waiter is on a break.

(Mordecai and Rigby get strangled and the recorder breaks)

Maitre'd: But do not worry. I will take care of you now.

Muscle Man: Uh...

Maitre'd: Please taste the dessert. It's the fanciest we have to offer.

Muscle Man: But there's no forks.

Maitre'd: Oh, there's no forks for this dessert. Only spoons. NOW PICK UP A SPOON AND EAT IT!

(Muscle Man struggles to pick the right spoon. He eventually picks one up, hoping it is the right one, but the waiter just frowns.)

Maitre'd: You chose wrong. (Snaps fingers) It's time for you to leave.

Muscle Man: What? Why?

Maitre'd: Because you're not fancy. You do not eat the Crème brûlée with that kind of spoon. You disgust me.

(Everyone mumbles to themselves)

Herb: Is that true, Mitch? You faked being fancy?

Maitre'd: Oui <Yes>. (Referring to Muscle Man and Starla) It's true; they're not fancy at all.

(Everyone leaves, and the Maitre'd claps to signal the security guards)

Maitre'd: And if you will not leave, we will escort you out. So what will it be?

Muscle Man: So what? So I'm not fancy. I only faked it so I could impress my girlfriend's parents, who, by the way, I learned are actually pretty cool. Who cares what kind of spoon this is. 

(Throws spoon in anger) 

Muscle Man: Starla, you're the only one I care about. We're finishing our dessert.

Maitre'd: Very well. Enjoy your desserts... IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM!

(Waiter grabs the girls)

Muscle Man: Hey, get your hands off her, bro!

Waiter: What are you going to do about it?

Mucsle Man: Huh? Herb?

Herb: I have something to confess too: I'm not fancy neither!

(Herb and Muscle Man punch the waiters)

Maitre'd: Destroy them!

Herb: Me and Rose were just pretending cause, we wanted to impress you.

(Herb and Muscle Man kick a waiter)

Muscle Man: You didn't have to do that.

(Employees attack, and Rose and Herb both punch a waiter)

Rigby: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Mordecai: We're unarmed.

Security guard: Well, let me give you a hand. 

(Attacks Mordecai with a chain with brass hands attached)

(Mordecai grabs the chain)

Security guard: Let go of my satisfaction chain!

(Rigby fights another security guard)

Muscle Man: Hey, Starla, nice- (Kicks) What? What the?

(Security guard repeatedly kicks Muscle Man while drinking tea. Rose and Herb grab onto the security guard's legs.)

Starla: Are you okay, Mitch?

(Waiter attempts to force Herb and Rose off his legs. Muscle Man and Starla charge at the waiter.)

(Maitre'd picks up the sharpest fork from his fork case and charges at them. Muscle Man trips him, sending him through a window and onto a parked car, killing him. His fork falls out of his hand.)

Muscle Man: Let's get out of here.

Herb: I know exactly where we can go.

(Scene cuts to Wing Kingdom)

Muscle Man: I thought you guys are picky.

Herb: We are. Hey, this place makes Bistro en Le Parc look like Bistro en Le Trash.

(All laugh)

Herb: This calls for a toast!

Muscle Man: I'll do you one better, Herb.

(Muscle Man flips over the table, and he and Herb start twirling their shirts)

Mordecai: You want the rest of my wings?

Rigby: No, thanks. I just lost my appetite.

(End of Fancy Restaurant)

(Episode begins at the now dome-sealed Park. Cut to Mordecai, Rigby and Fives pruning trees. Rigby grunts as he is pruning, and stops.)

Rigby: Aargh! Pruning's lame!

Mordecai: It wouldn't be so bad if Benson would buys some new tools. These things are like a hundred years old.

Rigby: Yeah! How come Muscle Man gets to do this the cool way?

Muscle Man: Uh, maybe because I'm highly trained, bro.

(The episode begins with a firework shooting up in the air and exploding.)

Rigby: Muscle Man, there is no way you're gonna pull this off.

Muscle Man: I swear, I've done it, before.

Mordecai and Rigby: Pffffft.

Muscle Man: Watch me!

(Muscle Man lights up two gun lighters and lights up two fireworks. The two fireworks shoot up in the air, they bump and explode. Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost watch the fireworks.)

Mordecai, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Whooooa...

Rigby: Oh, wow.

(The tiny spark from the fireworks itself lights up all the fireworks. They look back, and then the fireworks explode. All of the fireworks goes up and explode all at the same time. Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost look at the fireworks, while all of this is going on, Benson appears on the scene. Benson looks at the fireworks exploding, and the grand finale explodes with the words "HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!" Benson turns red, clearly enraged by what he has seen, he gets out the cart and goes up to them.)

Benson: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!?!

Muscle Man: We were just...

Benson: WHY WOULD YOU LIGHT OFF ALL THE FIREWORKS BEFORE THE BIGGEST EVENT OF THE YEAR?!?!

Muscle Man: Just hang on now, Benson. I know this looks bad, but I can fix it.

Benson: Fix it?! FIX WHAT?!?! YOU JUST RUINED THE 4TH OF JULY!!!!

Muscle Man: I know, I know. Just hear me out. I know a guy who's got the hook up on cheap fireworks.

Benson: I DON'T WANT CHEAP FIREWORKS!!!! THAT STUFF YOU JUST BLEW UP WAS TOP OF THE LINE!!!!!

Muscle Man: Benson, trust me. This guy's stuff is quality. I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.

Benson: Alright, fine! But if you guys aren't back before the show starts at sundown, YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!!

(Benson drives away, still fuming.)

Mordecai: Dude, you better to be able to get those fireworks.

Muscle Man: Don't worry, we'll get 'em.

(Clock transition to a desert where the gang are driving the cart and a sign reading "SOUTH OF THE LINE" features the mascot eating chile rellenos. The gang then make the turn into South of the Line.)

Rigby: Dude, no way. Is this where they make South of the Line Chile Rellenos?

Mordecai: Oh, yeah. I heard about those. These are the really spicy ones right?

Muscle Man: Yeah, my boy Hector runs this place.

Rigby: So they sell fireworks here?

Muscle Man: Yeah, but it's just a little business he's got goin' on inside. So keep it under DL. Alright, you guys just stay put and don't go anywhere! I'll be right back.

(Muscle Man leaves the cart, knocks on the door to the warehouse, and whistles. Then a man is seen looking through a peephole.)

Man: Are you lookin' for somethin' friend?

Muscle Man: Um, I'm here to see Hector. Oh man.

(The man then brings Muscle Man into the warehouse. A couple of employees are also bringing in Mordecai, Rigby, and HFG.)

Rigby: Let go of me! Dude, what's goin' on!

Muscle Man: (To Rigby) Just keep your mouth shut!

(A door opens to reveal Hector and a couple of employees)

Muscle Man: (nervously) Hey, Hector.

(Hector cracks his neck from side to side and laughs)

Hector: Muscle Man! (hugs Muscle Man) It's good to see you, mi hermano! Why don't you never come to visit me, huh?

Muscle Man: (nervously) I.

Hector: Who are your friends?

Muscle Man: (nervously) Oh it's just a couple of...friends from The Park.

Hector: Oh. Well, welcome...friends from The Park. (laughs)

(Mordecai, Rigby, and HFG nervously say Nice to meet you)

(Hector's employees bring him a chair, and he sits on it)

Hector: (Talking to Muscle Man) So, tell me. To what do I owe this pleasure? Ah, let me guess! You're here for some of the world's spiciest chile rellenos!

Muscle Man: (nervously) Oh, thanks Hector. But, we were actually wondering if we could get some...fireworks.

Hector: Some what?

Muscle Man: (nervously) Um...just some fireworks.

Hector: (talking to his employees) I don't think I heard him correctly. Did you hear what he just said?

Employee: He said fireworks.

Hector: Oh, fireworks. (He screams in anger, throws the chair at the wall, and yells at Muscle Man) YOU COME HERE ASKIN' ME FOR FIREWORKS ON THE FOURTH OF JULY?!!

Muscle Man: Look, we screwed up and blew all of our fireworks by accident.

Hector: So you think you can just come to your uncle Hector and then bear you out huh?! I understand people make mistakes, and I'm a reasonable man. (calls for the person with the fireworks)

(A forklift came with a crate and Hector opens it, revealing fireworks)

Hector: Does this please you?

Mordecai, Rigby, and HFG: Oh yeah.

Muscle Man: That's perfect. Thank you, Hector.

Hector: (asking for money) Then hand it over. (Muscle Man hands him an envelope. He looks in it and is in shock) Where is the rest?

Muscle Man: What do you mean? It's all there.

Hector: But these are last minute fireworks, it's gonna cost you double!

Muscle Man: But that is all we have!

Hector: It's one box minimum. You can't afford it, then get out of my place of business!

Rigby: (points to El Diablo) How 'bout you just give us that one big one over there.

(Scene shows El Diablo, a firework displayed in a glass case)

Hector: (laughs) You want to buy El Diablo? Let me tell you a little story about El Diablo. It has been prophesized that if it is ever lit it will kill me, so no it is not for sale!

(Muscle Man pushes the people behind him and jumps onto Hector's leg)

Muscle Man: C'mon, Hector, please, you gotta hook us up with the fireworks! We'll do anything!

Hector: Ahh! (shakes Muscle Man off his leg) Get off of me you filthy dog! Alright! You want the fireworks so bad! (takes out a package from his pocket, and tosses it to Muscle Man) Here! If you deliver this package with no questions asked, I will give you that box of fireworks!

Muscle Man: Oh, thank you, Hector! Thank you!

(Clock transition to another part of the desert where the gang drives up to a business with a few men outside sitting at a table)

Muscle Man: Alright. Let's do this.

(The gang gets off the cart as a man walks up with a shotgun)

Man: Can I help you?

Muscle Man: We're here to deliver a package for Armando.

(Muscle Man knocks on the door)

Armando: (Inside) What's the matter with you?! I got a caller in here! You're costing me money! (opens door) What?!

Muscle Man: Armando.

Armando: Yeah!

Muscle Man: Package delivery from Hector.

Armando: Oh! (takes package) Then come on in! (The gang goes inside) Just wait here for a minute. I got something for you to deliver to Hector.

(The door closes behind him.)

Mordecai: Uh... we kinda have to get going.

Armando: Yeah, have a seat! (The gang sits down on the couch) Yeah, have a seat. (closes door to factory, and yells) Keep going ladies why are you so lazy?!

(A dog walks up to the gang with a chile relleno in his mouth and growls)

Hi Five Ghost: (nervously) Nice doggy!

Rigby: Forget this I'm going to find this dude.

Mordecai: Rigby, wait!

Mordecai, Muscle Man, and HFG: (to Rigby) Dude! No! Don't!

(Mordecai, Muscle Man, and HFG goes after Rigby, who opens the door to the factory)

Rigby: Whoa!

(The scene reveals workers working in the factory making 'South of the Line' chile rellenos, Armando rips the paper on the side of the package and the words gun powder is shown, and pours gunpowder in the chile rellenos)

Rigby: They're putting gunpowder in the South of the Line chile rellenos!

Armando: (To the gang) I told you to wait!

(Armando whistles and the gang are bagged up by his employees, the next scene reveals the screen to be black)

Rigby: Dude, what's goin' on?!

(A car labeled 'South of the Line' on the back window drops off the gang. They are unbagged as they are chained to a bench)

Hector: Tisk, Tisk, Tisk! Looks like somebody stopped their noses somewhere they don't belong!

Muscle Man: Hector, we can explain!

Hector: No! Let me explain something to you, amigo. The FDA allows 0% gunpowder in each chile relleno. Do you know how much gunpowder is in each South of the Line chile relleno? 500%!

(The gang gasps)

Muscle Man: We're not gonna tell the FDA, Hector!

Hector: I know you're not gonna tell the FDA (takes out chile rellenos), 'cuz we're gonna blow you into a million little Muscle Man pieces! (laughs)

Mordecai: Hector, you don't have to do this!

Hector: Oh don't worry! It's no trouble really! (laughs)

(He lights up the chile rellenos with a gun lighter)

Hector: Happy Fourth of July! (laughs)

(Hector and his employees go into another room where they watch the gang through a window)

Hector: (laughs)

(The gang struggles to break free)

Mordecai: Muscle Man, (struggles to break free) how do you even know this guy?!

Rigby: Yeah! You got us into this Muscle Man!

Hi Five Ghost: What are we gonna do?!

(Hector is still watching through the window, while eating a chile relleno and chuckling evilly)

Muscle Man: I got an idea, follow my lead! Stand! (The gang stands up with the bench) Now turn around! (The gang turns around)

Hector: Let's stop them! (one of his employees is trying to find the right key) C'mon! C'mon!

(The chile rellenos explode and the blast shatters the bench into pieces, unchaining the gang in the process)

Mordecai: Let's go!

Hector: Give me the keys! (Hector struggles to unlock the door) AAAHH!

(Rigby grabs El Diablo from the glass case and runs out of the door)

Muscle Man: Let's go! Let's go!

(Hector finally unlocks the door)

Hector: Get them!

(Muscle Man picks up a chile relleno and locks the door and uses a broom to jam it. He throws the chile relleno through the window and it lands on the other chile relleno. The South of the Line explodes as the gang drive away using the cart. The sun is shown to be setting)

Rigby: We're not gonna make it!

Muscle Man: HAAA!

(Muscle Man steps on the accelerator and the cart goes faster)

(The scene changes to the park)

Spectator #1: Hey! What's going on? Why aren't they starting yet?

Spectator #2: Yeah! It's sundown.

(The spectators start to protest.)

Benson: I'm going to ask you to please remain patient. The fireworks show will commence shortly.

(Benson then screams in anger, unheard by the audience.)

Benson: (to Skips) I knew I couldn't trust them.

(The cart is shown to have entered the park. The gang gets off the cart and Muscle Man places El Diablo in the ground)

Benson: Where have you guys been? I told you to get here before the show!

Mordecai: Sorry it took so long.

Muscle Man: We're good to go! Rack 'em and stack 'em!

Benson: (snatches the lighter gun from Skips) Wait, where's the rest of the fireworks?

Muscle Man: That's all we could get.

Benson: You guys only got one firework?

Rigby: That's not just any firework.

Benson: This wasn't the deal! You guys were supposed to replace the ones that you set off this morning.  That's it, I'm calling it off. You guys are all fired! (walks back to the microphone about to call off the show.)

Hi-Five Ghost: What?!

Muscle Man: Oh, come on Benson!

(Hector suddenly arrives, wielding a golden rifle)

Hector: Ah-Ah-Ahhh... Hand it over. 

(Benson is scared. He reluctantly gives Hector the gun lighter)

Benson: Who are you?!

Hector: I'm the guy whose business your employees just destroyed. I'm also the guy who's gonna blow you all sky-high with this! (he gets a rocket from his pocket and puts it in the rifle) Starting with you, JEFE (Aims at Benson. Hector activates the gun lighter)

Muscle Man: Men! What are we gonna do?

Mordecai: I think I got an idea. (whispers to the other guys) Hey Hector! Your Chile Rellenos are the least spicy Chile Rellenos in the world.

Hector: (stops from lighting the rocket) WHAT?!

Rigby: Yeah! They're not even world-renowned!

Muscle Man: Nobody's even heard about them, Hector!

High Five Ghost: (sprouts two hands) And...all the people who have heard about them, don't even think they're spicy.

Hector: (slowly at first) South of the Line Chile Rellenos are the spiciest... most world-renowned... (begins raising his voice) CHILE RELLENOS... IN THE WORLD! (he lights up the rocket and shoots it at the gang)

Mordecai: NOW!

(The rocket hits El Diablo and some Chile Rellenos, which sets off El Diablo.)

Hector: NO, THE PROPHECY!!!!

(El Diablo shoots to the sky and a firework version of the South of the Line mascot appears in the sky. Everyone cheers as the mascot starts to spangle. The gang and Hector look up in the sky.)

Hector: She's even more beautiful than I could ever imagined.

(The mascot repeatedly fires his revovlers as everyone cheers, then he turns to Hector)

El Diablo: Hector.

Hector: NOOOOO!!! (As he retreats, the mascot drops his revolvers, grabs his shotgun and starts shooting a firework at Hector. As Hector continues running away, the firework sends him flying up in the air, screaming. The mascot then repeatedly pumps his rifle and shoots fireworks at Hector. The mascot then pumps his rifle and shoots the last firework at Hector) No! (The last firework sends him back to the warehouse as he's screaming and falling) 

(He and the South of the Line sign explode, killing him, as the fireworks starts to spangle. The spectators and the gang cheer.)

Benson: Hahahahaha. Alright, you guys, somehow you manage to top last year's firework show, so I'm guess I'm not gonna fire you.

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost: Alright! Yeah! Yes! Alright.

Benson: In fact, I'm putting you four in charge of a very special job.

Rigby: Oh, cool. What special job?

Benson: (turning red) REPLACING THE THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS WORTH OF GRASS YOU JUST BURNT!!! (He and Skips walk away)

Muscle Man: (to the guys) Don't worry, I know a guy who's got the hook up on real cheap sod.

Mordecai: *awes* Alright, dude, time to get up. (Rigby whines) Come on, Rigby. (Rigby whines more.) Dude, get up. We gotta get ready for work.

Rigby: (sits up) Okay, okay. (grunts)

Mordecai: (stands up) Dude, this is so cool. I never got a job that got you a place to live.

Rigby: I never even had a job.

(Rigby gets the dirty clothes off of him while Mordecai is watching him struggle getting it off.)

Mordecai: Yeah, about that. (Rigby gets up and puts the dirty clothing in one corner.) I kinda told them you'd be a good idea to hire, so can you try not to do the whole "Rigby thing".

Rigby: "Rigby thing"? What do you mean?

Mordecai: I mean you're lazy.

Rigby: What? I'm not lazy.

Mordecai: Dude, you were too lazy to fill up the application for this job. That's why I had to vouch for you in the first place.

Rigby: (angrily) Just because I was too lazy to do something boring like filling in a job application doesn't mean I'm lazy.

Mordecai: Okay. Okay. Look. Let's just both promise that starting right now we're not gonna do anything to screw this up. Okay?

Rigby: Okay. You think there's breakfast stuff in the kitchen?

(Mordecai thinks...)

Mordecai: Only one way to find out.

(Scene changes in the fridge where Mordecai opens it.)

Mordecai: ...Milk.

(Gets the milk.)

Rigby: ...Cereal.

(Gets the cereal.)

Mordecai & Rigby: ...Combine.

(Mordecai pours the milk & Rigby pours the cereal.)

(Scene changes where they sit down in the kitchen table where Rigby was about to eat his cereal until Mordecai puts his hand in his chest.)

Mordecai: This is the only clean spoon left, dude. Let's play "Punchies" for it.

Rigby: Okay. Me first. (Rigby punches Mordecai but, gets surprised when he thought it was weak. Mordecai laughs then punches Rigby hard in his arm.) Owww. Take it.

Mordecai: (laughs then talks with his mouth full) Man, so far this job is awesome! I still can't believe we get our own rooms!

Rigby: Dude, those rooms aren't cool. There's nothing in 'em. I had to sleep on the floor last night.

(Rigby eats the cereal from the box.)

Mordecai: Well, yeah, I mean, we could get some stuff for it after we make some money. You know?

Rigby: I guess.

Mordecai: You want some milk.

Rigby: Yeah.

(Mordecai pours the milk into Rigby's mouth when all of a sudden benson comes in.)

Benson: Hey! Please don't eat up in the table like that.

Pops: Like what? (Gentle music appears when the scene is shown closer to a chair that Pops & Benson are taking out. Scene then shows Mordecai & Rigby in shock staring at it when they're not even paying attention to what they're doing.) Oh my. I've never seen anyone eating cereal like that. How quaint!

Benson: Yeah, well they shouldn't be doing that. That's what the bowls are for.

Pops: Oh, they're fine!

(Pops & Benson leave the room.)

Mordecai: Did you see that chair?

Rigby: I love chairs.

(They stair at each other and suddenly go outside where Pops & Benson took the chair out.)

Mordecai: Hey, Pops! What are you doing with that chair?

Pops: Oh, well. I no longer require its services. So, Benson & I are taking it to the place where the big man-made come upon & wisk it away to magic trash city!

(Mordecai & Rigby stay silent then look at Benson for an answer.)

Benson: We're throwing it away.

Rigby: Aw, what?

Mordecai: Yeah, why would you throw that thing out? It looks awesome. Can we at least check it out, before you chuck it?

Rigby: (Quickly) Yeah, can we at least check it, before you chuck it?

(Pops & Benson put the chair down.)

Pops: (Laughs) Oh, that would be fine.

(Rigby laughs.)

Mordecai: Yeahhh...

Benson: Look, I gotta get back to work. You guys help him throw it away when you're done.

(Benson leaves the scene while Mordecai & Rigby come closer to the chair.)

Mordecai: Aw, man, this chair is awesome. Look how awesome it looks.

Rigby: Dude, it sounds like old man pants.

(They both feel the couch which makes a cushion sound)

Mordecai: (laughs) I'm gonna sit in it.

Rigby: Good idea.

(Mordecai sits on the couch while awing. Later, he then feels uncomfortable.)

Rigby: What? What's wrong?

(Mordecai positions with the chair in many ways to feel comfortable.)

Mordecai: (quickly) This is the most uncomfortable chair I ever sat in.

Rigby: Aw, what? Let me try it.

Pops: Yes, I'm afraid it's true, I purchased it through the post, and it just isn't as comfortable as it looks.

Rigby: Awwwwwww. This is terrible. Maybe we're just not sitting it right.

Mordecai: Hmm, Hmm.

Rigby: Come on, baby, come on, baby, come on! Come on, baby!!!

(Rigby pull his eyes and bites the chair and sits on the chair)

Rigby: Ugh. It's just not comfortable, man. If you ask me, I think we should throw it away.

Pops: Oh, well, yes, that's what I'm on my way to do.

Mordecai: Hey, Pops, since you're throwing it out anyway, can I just have it?

Rigby: No, let me have it!

Mordecai: I asked him first. Come on, Pops!

Rigby: No, Pops, me!

Pops: Well, I don't think I know who to give it to. But if you two can settle it between yourselves, then you're more than welcome to have it.

Mordecai: Yeah, let's play punches.

Rigby: No way. I'm not playing that game with you anymore. If we're playing for something like that chair, then we need to play a game that takes a little more skill.

Mordecai: How much skill?

Rigby: Rock Paper Scissors.

Pops: Oh, I adore Rock Paper Scissors. Although where I come from, we called it "Quartz Parchment Shears".

Mordecai: Alright, how do you wanna play it. Are we go in a one-two-three go? Or one-two-three, shoot on three?

Rigby: Let's do it on three.

Mordecai: Alright, fine. But let's stretch first. I don't wanna put my hammy or whatever.

Rigby: Okay.

(M&R stretch first for Rock Paper Scissors)

Muscle Man: What's up with the new guys?

Pops: They're getting ready to play Quartz Parchment Shears for my old Silounna.

Muscle Man: Nice. You know who else is gonna play Quartz Parchment Shears for your old Silounna?

Pops: Who?

Muscle Man: My mom!

(Pops, Hi Five Ghost and Muscle Man laugh)

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost give a high five)

Muscle Man: See? I told you I was gonna say it!

Mordecai: Ready?

Rigby: Hmm.

(Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears one tie)

Pops: Oh, my!

(Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors two ties and Pops laugh)

Benson: Shouldn't you guys be throwing that thing away?

Pops: Benson, come quick! Quartz Parchment Shears and they've already tied two times, it's absolutely fascinating!

Benson: I have work to do. And they shouldn't be playing that. It's an evil game.

Pops: Whoo, an evil game.

Rigby: Two ties. You don't know what I'm throwing next, baby.

Mordecai: Pfft. I already know what you're gonna throw before you even throw it, baby.

Rigby: That's not even possible, baby!

(Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors eight ties and Pops watches in amazement; Rigby kicks the dirt)

Mordecai: Come on! (He walks away)

Pops: Good show! Jolly good show! (He pulls out a walkie talkie) Everyone, come quick! The most amazing game of Quartz Parchment Shears is happening right now! (laughs)

(Montage begins where Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears 99 ties and Pops watches in shock until the montage ends. A crowd of people are yelling as they watch Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors)

Rigby: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

Mordecai: No! No! No!

Pops: Ninety-nine times in a row! (laughs)

Mordecai: Enough! Why are we even doing this? You don't think this chair is comfortable.

Rigby: So? Neither do you!

Mordecai: Dude, I was lying. I was just saying it so you wouldn't want it.

Rigby: I was lying also. I love that chair!

Mordecai: Well, then, I guess it's too bad, because after I win it, I'm never gonna let you sit in it.

Rigby: (groans) Then finish it.

(Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors 100 ties, but lightning, thunder and an evil voice laughing is heard from the sky)

Evil Voice: Since no one can decide, and all is played is tied 100 times, I'd take it upon myself to eat your prize.

(A black hole appears in front of them, and the people run to the house for safety)

Rigby: What is that?!

Mordecai: Come on, let's go!

(They go to the house for safety, except a business man, who gets sucked into the black hole)

Rigby: This is all your fault!

Mordecai: How is this my fault?! I just wanted to play punchies!

(They see the chair about to be sucked into the black hole)

Rigby: The chair! (He goes after the chair)

Mordecai: Rigby! (He goes after Rigby)

Pops: Oh? Oh! Oh, dear. (He goes after the duo to save the chair)

(Cut to a different area of the park where Benson and Skips are driving in the cart)

Pops: (over the speaker) Hello, hello? Please, someone, come quick! Quartz Parchment Shears has gone terribly wro--- (The speaker dies)

Benson: Pops, where are you? (He and Skips see an explosion behind the bushes; sighs) Skips, take the shortcut, I'll go around back.

Skips: Hmm.

(He takes the shortcut through the bushes and Benson drives the cart back to the guys)

Benson: Idiots.

(Rigby, Mordecai and Pops hold on a lamppost as they're screaming, trying to save the chair, but the black hole monster reveals itself and roars and goes back into the black hole, and it gets bigger and stronger, making Pops let go of the lamppost, and as the trio are about to be sucked into the black hole, Skips grabs Pops' legs)

Pops: Skips!

Skips: What did you do?

Benson: (he came with the he cart) They were playing Rock Paper Scissors, grab on.

Skips: (he grabs on a bar) Don't you know that's an evil game?

Benson: Hold on, everybody!

Pops: Hold on, everybody!

Mordecai: Hold on, every... Rigby!

(Half of Rigby's body is sucked into the black hole along with the chair, and Benson and Skips gasp, but Benson drives the cart towards the garage door, pulling half of Rigby's body and the chair out of the black hole, and Benson continues driving until he hits the garage door)

Skips: What do we do?

Benson: You have to break the tie!

Mordecai: Rigby, we have to end this! I'm gonna throw rock!

Rigby: Yeah, right.

Mordecai: I'm not kidding!

Benson: Hurry up! Do it now!

(Mordecai and Rigby breaks the tie, causing the black hole to explode, leaving the park ruined. Everybody gets up)

Mordecai: Did you win?

Rigby: (coughs)

Mordecai: I think you've won.

Rigby: (sighs) It doesn't matter. I wasn't able to hold on to the chair anyways.

Pops: Look!

(Half of the chair is still left)

Mordecai & Rigby: Aw, cool.

Benson: No, you don't. You're not getting that chair. But here's what you do get. You get to flip that cart back over, you're throwin' that chair away, and then you're cleanin' up this whole MESS! (the camera zooms out, revealing the entire lawn destroyed) Pops, you're comin' with me. And you two idiots, if this isn't cleaned up when I get back, YOU'RE FIRED!

(Benson walks into the house with Pops and Skips before he slams the door shut)

Mordecai: Okay, starting now, let's both promise not to do anything to screw this up. Agreed?

Rigby: Agreed. Rock Paper Sissors for who gets to drive the cart? (both shake their fists, attempting who gets to drive it first)

(End of First Day)

(A strange red meteor is heading toward earth. It passes two planets and goes toward earth. Meteor's eyes open. Cut to the house, where Mordecai and Rigby are playing video games.)

Mordecai: You missed!

(Mordecai knocks out Rigby's character)

Mordecai: Aw yeah!

Rigby: Whatever, dude, I don't care, cause I got all day to beat you because we got the day off!

Both: Aww Yeah! (high fives)

(Skips enters)

Skips: Hey, guys you busy?

Rigby: Yeah, Skips, we're playing Alley Fight Dudes.

Skips: Oh, cause I was wondering if I could cash in this coupon you gave me for my birthday.

(Zooms in on coupon)

Skips: It says you will do all my jobs for a day.


Rigby: What? I don't renember writing that.

Skips: It's from six months ago.

(Flashbacks to Skips' birthday party)

Muscle Man: (laughs) Open it, Skips, open it!

(He takes off his shirt and spins it, )

(We pan over to Mordecai and Rigby.)

Rigby: Aw, man. Did you get Skips anything for his birthday?

Mordecai: No, did you?

(Rigby shakes his head)

Mordecai (continued): We gotta get him something!

Rigby: But we don't have any money! And it's too late.

Mordecai: Dude. Birthday coupon.

(Mordecai picks up coffee cup from napkin and writes)

Mordecai: (While Writing) Mordecai and Rigby promise to do all Skips' chores for one day. BOOM!

Rigby: Aw, man! I don't wanna do Skips' chores for the day!
Mordecai: Dude, we have to get him something! Besides, no one ever uses these things anyway.
Rigby: Good point.

(Both walk up to Skips)

Mordecai: Hey, yo, Skips, my man! We went all out on this one.

(Flashback ends)

Rigby: Oh yeah. UUUHHH! Can't we just do it some other day?

Skips: Sorry, fellas, I've been saving this for today. 

(We zooms in on Skips)

Skips (continued): I have something very important to do, that if I can't get to because you guys didn't do my chores, the whole world could come to an end.

Rigby: UUUHHH! Okay! We'll do your work!

Mordecai: Yeah, Skips. We got it.

Skips: Thanks guys. (Hands paper to Mordecai) Here's a list of my jobs for the day.

(Mordecai and Rigby look through the list.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Looks at paper) Aw, What?

Rigby: Seriously?


Skips: Best gift in the world.

(Skips walks away)

Mordecai: Uuhh. This is brutal.


Rigby: I know. I'm not doing that.

Mordecai: Well, dude, we have to. Do you want the world to come to an end?

Rigby: Yeah, right. That's just what you say if you want somebody to do something.

Mordecai: (Shrugs) Cmon, dude, let's just get this over with.

(Montage begins. Mordecai mows the lawn. Then we see he has sunglasses on. Rigby is next to him wearing goggles and has a metal detector. They check off mowing the lawn on list. Next they are planting trees. They plant a tree. They cross off doing that job. Next Rigby is cutting wood and Mordecai is retiling the floor in the bathroom. They check it off. Mordecai uses a chainsaw to cut wood while Rigby uses a wood chipper. They carry wood to the cart. They check it off.)

(They are raking)

Both: (Throw down rakes) Yea! (They high-five)

Mordecai: Dude, that's the fastest we've ever finished anything!

(They walk on path)

Rigby: Hey man, when we're done, do you want to grab some sodas and play Alley Fight Dudes?


Mordecai: Yeah. That sounds good. The only thing we have left to do is that we have to move Pops' harpsichord.

Rigby: Nice.

(Cuts to Pops' room)

Mordecai: (picks up harpsichord) Alright. 1, 2, 3!

(They Both Lift, but it is really hard to lift)

Rigby: Dude! Let's just call Skips!

Mordecai: No, man! Cmon! You can do this! Go go go go go go! Go!

(They carry out of Pops room and down the stairs. Harpsichord makes noises. The harpsichord is too big to go through door.)

Mordecai: Cmon, Rigby. Keep pushing!

(Still can't get it through)

Rigby: Dude, it's stuck. I'm calling Skips.


Mordecai: NO! We made him a promise. We are not calling Skips.

(Benson drives near the house in the cart)

Benson: Hey! What are you two doing? I thought that was Skips' job.

Mordecai: We were just-


Benson: You know what, I don't care. Just get it out of there, it's a fire hazard.

(Benson drives away)

Mordecai: Dude. We gotta call Skips.

(Cuts to a candle with a red glow, then shows Skips meditating around many candles. His phone rings, and Skips ignores it. It has Mordecai and Rigby leave a voicemail.)

Voicemail: This is Skips. You know what to do.

Mordecai: Skips! Skips! We need your help. The harpsichord got stuck in the doorway.

Rigby: Yeah, Skips, it's stuck! You gotta help us! Benson said it was a fire hazard!

Mordecai: Yeah, it's a fire hazard. Pick up the phone, Skips!

Both: We know you're home, Skips, pick up the phone, Skips! (Skips is getting angry) We know you're home Skips, pick up the phone, Skips!

Skips: ALRIGHT! (Picks up phone) I'll be right over.

(Back at house)

Skips: Alright, What did you guys do.

Mordecai: We were trying to move it and it got stuck.

Skips: Alright, on three, I want you guys to push. I'm gonna try to pull it through, alright? 1, 2 3, HUUUUH!

(Everyone pushes)

(Rigby notices the top part was blocking it)

Rigby: Oh, it's stuck on this thing.

(He takes it down, and the top lands on Skips' fingers)

Skips: AAAAAH!

Rigby: Man, I'm sorry, Skips!

Skips: Dooh, haaa! (He tumbles back)

Mordecai: Skips, are you alright?

Skips: This is bad.

(Skips lifts up broken fingers)

Rigby: Are pinkies supposed to bend that way?

Mordecai: Well, at least it was your last chore for the day.

Skips: No. You don't understand!

(Out of the blue, Gary's truck comes from the air and flies toward the ground. The door opens and Gary comes out.)

Gary: SKIPS!

(Everybody walks up to him) 

Gary (continued): Skips, the time has come once again for you to fight Klorgbane the Destroyer

Mo: Wait a minute, is that what you have to go do? You gotta fight somebody?

Rigby: Yeah, who's Klorgbane?

Mordecai: Skips. you can't fight anybody with your hands like that!

Gary: What's wrong with your hands?

Skips: Uh...

(He hides his broken fingers.)

Skips (continued): Nothing, Gary.

(He laughs nervously.)

Skips (continued: I'm fine.

Gary: Are you sure?

Skips: Yeah, I'm sure. Come on, Gary. Let's go.

(They teleport inside the car and drive off.)

Rigby: Dude!

Mordecai: We gotta make sure he's okay come on

( Mordecai and Rigby chase and get into the truck)

Rigby: Dude, where's this thing going?

Mordecai: Do you really have to ask?

(Gary's car flys into the blue and teleports to the Guardians of Eternal Youth's Realm, where the Guardians of Eternal Youth are waiting for Skips)

Gary: Guardians of Eternal Youth, I bring you the mighty Skips.

(Skips kneels)

Reginald: Skips, another one hundred-year cycle has passed. Thank you for once again saving us by fighting the dark one, Klorgbane the Destroyer. Brothers, let us unleash the Fists of Justice.

(Guardians of Eternal Youth shoot a hole in the ground and the fists of justice appear and are connected to Skips arms)

Skips: AAAHHHH!

(Mordecai and Rigby run to Skips.)

Mordecai: Skips wait!

Skips: What are you doing here?! I told you to stay at the park!

Mordecai: We're here to help!

Skips: Would you forget about the coupon? you can't help me with this! Now get out of here!

(Strange red meteor from the beginning crashes onto the realm.)

Reginald: Klorgbane!

(Klorgbane looks up to the Guardians of Eternal Youth)

Guardians of Eternal Youth:  AAAHHHH!

(Klorgbane flies upwards)

Klorgbane: Hello, my brothers. I have returned once more to claim my right for place of the council.

Reginald: Never! You're evil Klorgbane.

Klorgbane: Then after I defeat Skips I shall destroy you all!

Reginald: You will never defeat Skips, Klorgbane.

Klorgbane: We will just have to see about that, won't we?

(Klorgbane pulls out a red spike on a stick)'

Guardians of Eternal Youth: AAAHHHH!

(Skips and Klorgbane are ready to fight)

Rigby: Get him, Skips!

(Skips dodges Klorgbane's red spike, but he fails to punch him due to his fingers still broken)

Skips: AAAHHHH!

Klorgbane (laughing) What's the matter, Skips? Forgot how to use the Fists of Justice?

(He swipes his spike at Skips, but Skips dodges it again, then he kicks Skips to a corner)

Skips: AAHHH!

Reginald: Why isnt he fighting?

Klorgbane: I've waited many years for this moment.

(He charges his spike, hits the floor, causing it to rumble, and it hit Skips, sending him flying up in the air and he falls on a column)

Klorgbane: (laughing)

Guardians of Eternal Youth: AAAHHHH!

(Klorgbane charges his spike and hits Skips in the arm)

Skips: AAAHHHH!

Mordecai: Skips, no! Let us use the Fists of Justice! We were supposed to do all of Skips' jobs today, anyways.

Reginald: Don't be ridiculous! No mere mortal is capable of wielding the awesome power of the Fists of Justice!

Archibald: Nonsense! Brothers, let me handle this.

(He goes to Klorgbane)

Klorgbane: Hello, Archibald.

Archibald: Klorgbane, your reign of terror is over! I'm gonna crush you! I'm gonna make you eat that diaper like a giant diaper sandwich! And as soon as you finish that diaper sandwich, I'm gonna make you wear it like a cape!

(Klorgbane hits Archibald through the stomach with his spike, killing him)

Reginald: Give them the Fists of Justice.

(The Guardians of Eternal Youth translates the fists of justice from Skips and into Mordecai and Rigby's arms)

Mordecai: You know what? I think you guys were right. I mean, no mere mortal can fight Klorg-.

(The fists of justice move them to Klorgbane, but Mordecai and Rigby avoid him, and they don't know how to use the fists of justice)

Rigby: How do you use these things?!

Mordecai: I don't know!

Skips: (weakly) They have controls in them like that video game you guys play!

(Rigby pushes buttons that moves the fists)

Mordecai: Dude, it's just like Alley Fight Dudes!

Rigby: Yeah, it is!

Mordecai: Press start on three! Ready? 1...

Mordecai and Rigby: 2, 3!

(Rigby pushes the button and Mordecai moves a control stick, which the fists punches Klorgbane)

Mordecai: Let's cross this chore off the list.

(Mordecai and Rigby run to Klorgbane and start punching him)

Guardians of Eternal Youth: Yeah!

Gary: Go! Go! Go!

Skips: Go...!

(Klorgbane charges his spike to hit Mordecai and Rigby)

Skips: Watch out!

Mordecai: Rigby, cover me!

(Klorgbane is about to hit Mordecai and Rigby, but they hit him with the fists, then Mordecai grabs his neck, then Rigby punches him, sending back into space)

Klorgbane: AAAHHHH! I'll be back!

Mordecai: Klorgbane, huh? More like Klorg-lame.

Mordecai and Rigby: WOOOOOOOOOAAAAHHHHHHHH!

(After the fight with Klorgbane)

Reginald: Thank you for saving us from the wrath of Klorgbane.

Rigby: No problem.

Reginald: How can we repay you? Eternal life, Supreme knowledge of the universe? Just say the word, and it's yours.

(They look at Skips; back at the house, Reginald and a guardian are moving the harpsichord)

Reginald: You are very welcome, Skips.

Guardian: Youre welcome, Skips.

Skips: Best gift in the world.


(The episode opens at the snack bar with Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost around a table eating lunch)

Mordecai: Alright. Best movie crash scene of all time...Go!

Muscle Man: It's gotta be "Full Metal Impact".

Everyone but Benson: Full Metal Impact!

(Rigby imitates the scene from Full Metal Impact, and everybody laughs)

Benson: Never saw that one.

Mordecai: What?

Benson: Maybe I'll pick it up on VHS.

(Everybody else groans as Benson takes a bite of his sandwich)

Muscle Man: Benson, we're all deeply offended by that word you just said.

Benson: What, VHS?

(Everybody groans again)

Benson: What?

Muscle Man: Didn't you learn anything from the format wars?

Benson: When was that? I don't know, you guys never include me in stuff outside of work.

Mordecai: If you wanna watch it, you gotta watch it on the best format out there.

Benson: What format is that?

(Transition to the Library, with a section titled "LaserDisc". Many people are seen searching through laserdiscs, as we see Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and HFG walk up to Archie the Archivist)

Archie: Well, well, well. If it isn't the Discmasters!

Mordecai: Hey man. One copy of "Full Metal Impact" on laserdisc, please.

Archie: Excellent choice! 

(Archie gets the movie from under his desk)

Archie: And - here it is!

Mordecai: Thanks.

(Mordecai goes to grab the laserdisc)

Archie: Oh, I can't hold it in! Things have been so wonderful lately!

(Archie swipes the laserdisc away from Mordecai, much to the discmasters' confusion)

Archie: Thanks to you - you can't go anywhere without seeing a laserdisc!

Mordecai: Cool, man. Can we just get - ?

Archie: Oh, right.

(Archie goes to pass the laserdisc to Mordecai)

Rigby: So what else is new, dude?

(Archie suddenly pulls the laserdisc back again much to the other guys' annoyance)

Archie: Well, you know...funny you should bring it up. I recently saw something troubling. It's in the tapestry!

(Archie walks the discmasters over to the "Tapestry of Formats", guiding them through it as what he says is seen on the screen)

Archie: See, back here is the first prophecy. Here are you defeating VHS during The Great Format Wars three months ago. There's me in my Laserdisc Guardian form...and there I am undergoing painful surgery to look human again. Say, who's that handsome devil?

(The discmasters stare at him, as he quickly clears his throat and continues)

Archie: And here we are at the second prophecy. Something about a second format war...a new format rising, and it all begins with the arrival of a fifth discmaster.

(Benson walks out of the library's restroom)

Benson: Hey guys, you get the movie yet?

(Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Archie all gasp. Benson, whose hands are dripping wet, is confused)

Benson: Huh? No, they just ran out of paper towels!

Mordecai: Benson, could you move over there for a sec?

(Benson moves towards the tapestry)

Rigby: Now go like this...

(Rigby raises his fist and Benson follows. The camera zooms out to reveal the tapestry showing a silhouette of Benson doing the same thing)

Archie: We must gather the remaining obsolete formats. War is coming.

(Small montage of the discmasters collecting together the Guardians of Obsolete Formats. Betamax is seen cleaning a car, before being interrupted by the discmasters. Reel-to-Reel now has a job at Cheezers, and while taking out the trash, finds the discmasters. Floppy Disk is seen mourning at 8-Track's grave, but is then stopped by the discmasters once again. We see a shot of the Laserdisc team walking through the street. Cut to Wing Kingdom, where they are all sat)

Archie: Now, according to the second prophecy, a new format will rise, and seek total domination. The only way to stop it is with the Universal Remote!

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man & HFG: Whoa...

(The door suddenly slams open with an obsolete format known as Microfiche coming through it. He has a disc through his chest, and he collapses)

Microfiche: My...brothers...

Betamax: Microfiche!

(Everybody runs over to him. Archie pulls the disc out of his chest)

Archie: What is this?

Microfiche: New format...called...DVD!

Floppy Disk: The prophecy!

(The original discmasters gasp)

Microfiche: He has a new weapon called...Special Features!

(Microfiche starts gasping for air, before his screen blacks out - indicating his death)

Archie: No!

Betamax: DVD!

(Betamax punches Wing Kingdom's window, as we transition to an e-waste dumpster, where Microfiche has been put into. Archie puts his hand on the dumpster and looks to the sky)

Archie: The hour is near...hurry my brothers!

(The scene transitions to the gang on the top of a tall building)

Benson: Are you sure about this?

Archie: Yes.

(Archie is seen reading a book showing a position of how the discmasters should be to find the Universal Remote. He lowers the book to reveal the gang in those exact positions. Mordecai and Muscle Man are both bent over on their knees, while Rigby is standing on their backs with Benson on his shoulders. Hi Five Ghost is standing to the side)

Mordecai: So...now what?

Archie: Now, the Universal Remote shall be revealed.

Benson: Argh, this is ridiculous! Rigby, put me - down?

(The sun shines through Benson's glass head, creating a laser-like beam from his head pointing towards their destination)

Rigby: Whoa...

(The destination is revealed to be "Sam's Electronics")

Archie: Sam's Electronics! Of course.

(The Guardians smash through the store window, as the discmasters continue to move in their earlier position, with Fives floating alongside them)

Hi Five Ghost: Nice work, guys.

(They see the beam leading them to the Universal Remote, which everybody gathers around)

Everyone: Whoa...

Archie: Behold - The Universal Remote!

Muscle Man: Looks like a sword-in-the-stone type deal. Since I'm clearly the strongest, I'll probably have no problem pulling it out.

(Muscle Man runs over to pull the Universal Remote out of its stand but is electrocuted immediately, blasting him back)

Archie: Discmasters, remember the tapestry. There's only one person who can free the remote.

(In Archie's book, the figure holding the remote is similar to Benson)

Mordecai: Dude, Benson. It's you.

Rigby: Yeah, dude.

Benson: Ugh, seriously?

(Benson walks up to the remote and attempts to lift it. He sees a light shine above him as he majestically pulls it out with no struggle)

Benson: I actually did it! Muscle Man couldn't even do it and I actually did it! You guys go through this every time you wanna watch a laserdisc?

Mordecai: Yeah, pretty much.

Rigby: Mhm.

(The discmasters and friends leave Sam's Electronics, to be stopped by the voice of DVD)

DVD: Not so fast, guardians!

(A light shines onto the group, which is seen coming from a giant robotic DVD player. There are two more of these as well as a whole army of DVD soldiers)

DVD: We've got you surrounded! Give up.

Archie: Who are you?

DVD: Are you really that dense, old man? Microfiche knew who I was.

Archie: *gasps* DVD!

DVD: Way to crack the jewel case, Laserdisc Holmes. Or should I say...Sherlock Father!

Archie: I...have a son? Why am I not surprised? Another cheap knock-off of the real deal

DVD: Cheap knock-off? Not only do I hold more data than you, I'm smaller and more compact too!

(DVD passes Archie a DVD disc)

Archie: Ha, hate to break it to you, kid. All through history, man has favored large things. Large horses, large bank accounts, large ice cream sundaes. Nobody's gonna want this - size matters!

Mordecai: Laserdiscs are everywhere, now!

Rigby: Yeah! Good luck having people switch to DVD. Probably stands for "disc that's very dumb".

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOHHHH!!!

DVD: It stands for "digital versatile disc". You'll know DVD soon enough.

(DVD presses a button, causing a radio tower to create a signal, summoning Internet)

DVD: Meet my new ally: Internet!

Internet: NEUTRALISE OBSOLETE FORMATS. LOLOLOLOLOL.

DVD: With internet controlling my army via wifi, the world will quickly know DVD. Bow down to your new master, father.

Archie: Never!

Benson: Okay, can we just-? Look, I don't know if you know but I'm the fifth discmaster, so - DVD...say goodnight!

(Benson presses a button on the Universal Remote, but nothing happens. He presses it a few more times but still - nothing happens. Everybody smiles awkwardly while Benson panics)

Archie: What's going on...?

(The Universal Remote pings)

Universal Remote: Enter DVD device code.

Benson: How do we get the device codes?

(The Universal Remote prints off a giant list of device codes, which Mordecai opens)

Mordecai: Uhh...

DVD: Hahahahahahaha! 

(DVD grabs a DVD and puts it in his chest, transforming him into his true form. Archie does the same but with a laserdisc, turning him into the Laserdisc Guardian)

DVD: Prepare to become...obsolete.

(A chopper appears above the street the two teams are on. Floppy Disk points at it)

Floppy Disk: The Old Format Army! 

(A load of video store clerks and scientists grapple down ropes from the chopper, as well as two additional obsolete formats, Ampex Quadruplex and ENIAC)

ENIAC: Not so fast, DVD!

Rigby: Who's that?

Floppy Disk: That's ENIAC: The first digital computer!

ENIAC: You didn't expect us old formats to step aside while you make these poor video store clerks learn a new format, did you?

Clerk: Yeah, they're not paying us enough to learn new stuff, man!

ENIAC: Charge!

(The clerks charge towards DVD, as the scientists push ENIAC a long, since ENIAC has no legs. Unfortunately, ENIAC's wheels get stuck on a stump, causing him to drop to the ground and explode, killing him. Everyone gasps)

Floppy Disk: ENIAC!

DVD: Attack!

(Both sides charge towards and fight each other)

Floppy Disk: What's the status of the DVD code?

Mordecai: These instructions are really complicated.

Benson: I'm on it.

(Benson pulls out his phone)

Benson: What's the tech support number?

(One of DVD's lasers fires a huge hole in the ground near the discmasters)

Floppy Disk: Take cover. We'll hold them off until you find the code!

(The discmasters hide behind a van. The Laserdisc Guardian prepares his attack)

Internet: INITIATE FIREWALL

(Internet summons a literal fire wall to protect DVD, one of the players, and him from being attacked. The Laserdisc Guardian tries to use his attack on DVD's minions but it doesn't work. Meanwhile, the discmasters are still trying to find the device code. Benson is on the phone)

Universal Remote: Enter device code.

Rigby: Stop talking!

Benson: Person! I wanna speak to a live person!

(A DVD minion is inside a giant moving blade-like disc, and runs over multiple people on the opposite team, killing them. This includes Floppy Disk, but is stopped by the Laserdisc Guardian, who makes the operator fling into the air. Meanwhile, Benson has finally got through on the line)

Tech Support: Universal Remote Tech Desk, how may I help you?

Benson: Finally!

(The operator who the Laserdisc Guardian made go flying in the air lands on Benson's phone, crushing it)

Benson: No!

(The Laserdisc Guardian throws the giant DVD at one of the players, destroying it)

DVD: Eject the disc-fighters!

(A group of giant discs eject from the gaps of a tall building, and fire lasers down to the battlefield)

Ampex Quadruplex: You're all mine, DVD!

(Ampex Quadruplex runs towards DVD, who is firing DVDs at him. He tackles DVD, who then reappears to his side and erases the tackled version of himself, showing he has the power to change fate)

DVD: Ha! That was just an alternate ending, here's how it really ends!

(DVD jumps into the sky and bursts through Ampex Quadruplex, killing him. He lands near the Laserdisc Guardian, his father. A few more DVD minions are seen riding giant DVDs, and are headed towards the two family members. DVD quickly jumps as the giant disc mows over the Laserdisc Guardian. The Guardian turns around and speaks in his own language)

DVD: Why am I doing this? Because you left me and mom when I was just a mini-disc! W-w-where were you when my product launched? Where were you when I said my first words?

(The Laserdisc Guardian responds in his own language)

DVD: What were they? "Laserdisc rules", so...yeah.

(The Laserdisc Guardian responds again)

DVD: You're...sorry?

(The Laserdisc Guardian once again responds in an unknown language)

DVD: You wanna start the road to healing? Oh dad, I -

(Internet comes out of nowhere and fires a laser at the Laserdisc Guardian, killing him)

DVD: Father!

(He turns to Internet)

DVD: This wasn't part of the plan!

(Internet starts moving towards DVD threateningly)

Internet: ALL OBSOLETE FORMATS MUST BE NEUTRALISED.

DVD: I'm not obsolete, idiot!

Internet: ALL OBSOLETE FORMATS MUST BE NEUTRALISED.

DVD: Stop saying that! Special features!

(DVD fires a special-features-laser at Internet, but is has no effect)

Internet: NOBODY CARES ABOUT SPECIAL FEATURES. ONLY CONTENT MATTERS. I CAN STREAM IT DIRECTLY TO THEIR PC, LAPTOP OR TABLET. TV IS DEAD, AND SO ARE YOU...

DVD: Have a heart?

Internet: 404. NOT FOUND. STREAMING CONTENT.

(Internet fires a streaming-laser at DVD, who quickly escapes. Cut to the discmasters)

Mordecai: Try this one: 73928.

Reel-to-Reel: Look lively, troops...!

(The code disables Reel-to-Reel)

Rigby: Ugh! It's like we got all the codes except DVD!

Benson: Come on!

(Another robotic DVD player towers over the discmasters and is ready to fire. The gang screams, but the player is quickly impaled by DVD bursting through it)

DVD: I've made a terrible mistake. Internet is unstoppable!

Benson: Why should we help you?

DVD: If you don't, the world will have to settle for poorly compressed video on the web...forever.

(They all look passed the van)

DVD: Look, Internet's power comes from his wifi server.

(The camera focuses on the radio tower from which Internet was summoned)

Benson: Wifi...server!

(Benson snaps his fingers)

Benson: DVD, give us your code!

(Cut to the discmasters on a flying giant DVD)

Mordecai: Yeayuh!

(Internet notices the discmasters flying towards his server, and fires a laser at them. He hits the disc, causing it to crash land. Internet moves towards the discmasters)

Internet: TERMINATION INCOMPLETE. MUST NEUTRALISE ALL THREATS.

Mordecai: Rigby...the remote.

(Rigby lifts the Universal Remote)

Internet: REMOTE CANNOT CONTROL INTERNET.

Mordecai: But we can control everything else. Guys, now!

(Everybody presses a bunch of buttons on the Universal Remote, turning all of DVD's minions and allies against Internet. They all shoot at his server)

Internet: LOSING SIGNAL. NO-NO!

(The radio tower collapses)

Streaming: NO!

(Streaming collapses, and is disabled. Everyone gathers together)

Reel-to-Reel: The discmasters have triumphed! The Format Wars are over at last!

(Everybody cheers. Later at Pops' house, Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Reel-to-Reel, DVD and the ghost of Archie are watching "Full Metal Impact" on laserdisc. Everyone cheers after the crash scene. Pan over to the living room window. Internet is seen in a few form in a router, and he looks in at the discmasters)

Internet: FIDELITY IS NOT A PRIORITY FOR CONSUMERS. FREE STREAMING CONTENT WILL CONQUER ALL.

(End of Format Wars II)
(Episode starts with the park workers are at a Chinese restaurant, celebrating Benson's streak of good luck. They are all sitting at a table.)

Benson: I'm glad you could all join me for brunch today.

Pops: What's the occasion?

Benson: Do you even have to ask, Pops? It's to celebrate my amazing streak of good luck.

Pops: Good luck?

Benson: Yeah, don't you remember last night?

(Scene shows flashback of Benson beating Rigby at cards)

Rigby: Augh! You only beat me last night because of my bad luck.

Benson: No, Rigby, I only beat you because of my good luck, and it's that luck that makes me trust that we're all gonna love this restaurant that none of us have ever even been to.

Everyone: Yeah!

(Waitress appears to give food)

Waitress: Sui mai, har gow, fung jao...

Benson: I don't know what any of that is, but with my luck, I'm sure it's gonna taste great. We'll take it all! Dig in everyone, dim sum's on me!

(Waitress takes menu and writes on the menu)

Everyone: Yeah!

(Waitresses appear and give everyone their food)

(Everyone finishes food)

Muscle Man: That was delicious. Hey Rigby, where's your food?

Rigby: Food? He hasn't even brought my water yet.

(Waiter appears to serve Rigby)

Waiter: Excuse me? Here is your soup sir. (Spills it over Rigby).

Rigby: I didn't order soup!

Waiter: Oh, I'm so sorry, I'll go check on your order.

Benson: Oh my gosh, whoa, check it out. (Benson is seen holding a pearl while the park workers exclaim in amazement) Yeah, I just bit into that oyster, and there it was.

(Muscle Man, Hi-Five Ghost, and Skips exclaim in amazement)

(Waiter appears with fortune cookies)

Benson: Hey, so can I pay with this?

Waiter: Oh, of course, but I don't think we have enough money in the register to make change. Will you take a check?

Benson: Sure!

Waiter: Come on! (laughs)

Benson: I'm telling ya, I can't lose! (gets up and walks away)

Rigby: I gotta go dry off. (gets up and goes to the bathroom) Aw what, they're all out of towels?

Waiter: It must be your lucky day sir, the 1000th customer gets a free meal.

Benson: All right!

Rigby: Finally, my fortune cookie's here. At least one good thing will come from this meal. (opens cookie and sees fortune) Aw, what?! "Bad luck is coming your way". Ugh, I can't get a break! (switches his fortune with Benson's)

Mordecai: What are you doing dude? Hey, that's Benson's cookie! Man, that is not cool, put it back.

Rigby: Why, Benson will never know. "Good luck is coming your way", that's what I'm talking about.

Benson: Oh, we're reading fortunes eh? Okay, lets see what we have here, probably gonna win the lottery or something. Bad luck is coming your way? Ha! Whatever, it will take more than just a slip of paper to break the winning streak I'm having. Come on, let's get out of here.

(The park members except for Mordecai and Rigby walk away)

Mordecai: Rigby, seriously. You need to switch those fortunes back.

Rigby: (slaps Mordecai's hand away) Oh, come on! Benson's been having crazy good luck lately. He won't even know the difference. (walks away from the table) Besides, it's just a piece of paper.

Mordecai: (walks away as well) Yeah.. I guess.

(The park workers walk out of the Good Luck Restaurant)

Benson: You know what would make that place better? Some fortunes that were actually true.

(A black cat trips Benson over. Benson stumbles under a ladder and steps on a concrete crack. He knocks his head on a car side mirror and falls down)

Mordecai: Dude, Benson, you okay?

Benson: Yeah, I'm alright.

Rigby: (picks up a gold coin) Alright! It's a bus token!

(Skips boards on a nearby bus)

Pops: Come on guys. The bus is here.

(Pops, Mordecai, and Rigby get onto a bus and Benson runs after them)

Bus Driver: Nuh-uh. Sorry bro, bus is full.

(Bus door closes and the bus drives away leaving Benson behind)

Benson: That's cool guys! I guess I'll just walk!

(The rest of the park members are in the back of the bus)

Rigby: I told you Benson would never notice. Now we can both be lucky.

(The thugs approach Benson outside through the back window of the bus.)

Thug #1: Yo punk, give us your wallet!

(Thugs beat up Benson to the ground. A montage shows Rigby getting good luck, which includes beating Mordecai and Muscle Man 3 times in a row at Rock Paper Scissors, receiving free pizza and a drink from a pizza truck, and seizing a dollar note without getting run over, and Benson getting bad luck which includes his bathrobe getting sucked from the janitor and locked out of his room, having coffee spill on him when he goes for a sip, gets shocked when he is almost hit by a pizza truck and stumbles into a tree, which leads him being chased by bees, incidently knocking down their hive, and having his car key broke along with his car getting wrecked by a falling tree, before getting beaten up by the same thugs, once again and has bees all over him when a beekeeper comes along and slams a hive on Benson's face. The scene changes to Mordecai and Rigby in the arcade. Rigby is playing a video game [Super Donkey Bros.] with his back faced to it, and is surrounded by a crowd of people. Rigby reaches the high score and the crowd cheers)

Rigby: Oooooh! High score up in here! Mordecai, are you seeing this? I'm so lucky I don't even need to look at the screen! In fact, I don't even need to use my hands! Check it!

(Rigby does a handstand and uses his foot to press a button which activates the game's New World Record. The crowd and Rigby cheer and Mordecai has a blank face)

Mordecai: Ugh, I don't believe this.

Dante: Woah dude. You got some pretty sick gaming skills. The kind to get you on the cover of Video Game Monthly? (hands Rigby a business card) Name's Dante. I'm the magazine's lead editor. Today's your lucky day bro, cos I'm looking for the world's best gamer and you are totally it! (Mordecai looks disgusted) Gimme a call, we'll do an interview. Catch 'ya on the flip side bro!

(Dante and the rest of the crowd walk away from the arcade game)

Rigby: OOOOHH! Did you see that? I'm gonna be on the cover of Video Game Monthly!

Mordecai: Dude, you're horrible at video games! You just got lucky.

Rigby: Exaactlyy! I should have switched fortunes with Benson years ago!

Mordecai: None of that good luck is yours. It belongs to Benson. All this good stuff should be happening to him.

Rigby: What? No way! My life's never been better! I'm on a serious winning streak!

Mordecai: Give it back! (pushes Rigby to the floor and does a pat search on him)

Rigby: What are you doing? Hey, get off me!

Mordecai: Give me the fortune!

Rigby: No!

Mordecai: I'm not gonna let you ruin Benson's life. Ugh! (lets go of Rigby and Rigby stands up) Where is it?

Rigby: It's not on me. I knew you'd try something so I hid it.

Mordecai: Dude, you have to trade it back. Bad things are happening to Benson and it's only gonna get worse!

Rigby: What are you talking about? I haven't seen a single bad thing happen to Benson. You know what I think? I think you're just jealous.

Mordecai: Jealous?

Rigby: Jealous!

Mordecai: Dude, seriously-

Rigby: JEALOUS!

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: JEALOUS OF MY LUCK!

Mordecai: I'm calling Benson.

Rigby: (jokingly) Oh no, don't call Benson.

(Mordecai pulls out his mobile phone and dials Benson's number and the voice says that the number Mordecai is calling has been disconnected)

Voice: The number you are calling has been disconnected.

Rigby: Oooooh!

Mordecai: Ugh, forget it. (walks away) I'm telling him.

Rigby: Whatever. I'm so lucky I bet he wouldn't even notice. Hm hm hm hm hm!

(Scene changes to Benson's apartment. An eviction notice is stuck on Benson's apartment door and Mordecai pulls it off. The janitor walks by)

Mordecai: Hey, have you seen the guy who use to live here?

Janitor: Oh that guy. Man, what a string of bad luck. He lost his car, his apartment, his wallet, his credit cards, his driver's license.

Mordecai: Did he say where he was going?

Janitor: I just clean floors, I don't ask questions. Ooh, excuse me, there's a hot chick getting paper over there (walks away)

(scene changes to Pops' house and Mordecai walks into the kitchen and into Benson's room calling for Benson. Mordecai knocks on Muscle Man's caravan door)

Muscle Man: I haven't seen him.

(Mordecai opens the garage door and drives in the golf cart calling for Benson. Scene changes to Skips' house)

Mordecai: Skips, have you seen Benson?

Skips: He's playin' cards in my garage. He's convinced he can turn his luck around

Mordecai: No, he can't. It's not even his luck. We have to stop him.

(Benson walks into Skips' room)

Mordecai: Benson, I gotta tell you something.

Benson: Not right now, Mordecai. I'm in the middle of a hand.

Mordecai: No, Benson, listen. You shouldn't be playing cards right now.

Benson: Okay, so I've had a bad stretch lately. So my wallet and credit cards got stolen. So accounting lost my paycheck. So I can't afford to pay my rent or feed myself. But cards are where I'm luckiest. Cards are my girl. She's never let me down before and she won't do it this time.

Skips: Well you gotta stop playin' now cos you got nothin' left to wager with.

Benson: Actually, Skips, there is one more thing. (Benson walks back into Skips' garage and walks back into the room again). I just lost the park to the guy in the fanny pack.

(The guy's eyes glow yellow and Mordecai, Benson and Skips look scared)

Skips: He's a Warlock.

(The Warlock transforms into his true self and grows bigger and taller. He crashes through the top of Skips' garage and Mordecai, Benson and Skips run out of the house. Warlock cackles and conjures his fanny pack, sucking the Park into it)

Mordecai: Wooh, what the?

Benson: The park! What have I done?

Mordecai: I gotta find Rigby.

(The Warlock continues to suck the Park in and Mordecai is running for Rigby as the surroundings behind Mordecai are being sucked in. Mordecai runs past Muscle Man driving the golf cart)

Mordecai: Park! Warlock! Fanny pack!

Muscle Man: What was that bro? (screams in terror and jumps into a bush which gets sucked in)

(Mordecai runs into Pops' house and pushes the door open)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: (holding a mobile phone) Uh uh uh! Interview. Video Game Monthly. Can't talk. You're a loser.

Mordecai: Ugh! (snatches phone off Rigby)

Rigby: Hey!

(Mordecai throws the phone at the wall and breaks)

Rigby: Dude! Why did you do that?!

Mordecai: Look out the window!

Rigby: (looks out the window) Huh?

(The Park is still being sucked up and is on an isolated island)

Warlock: Lucky me! A full house!

(Warlock evil laughs and sucks up a part of the roof Mordecai and Rigby are standing under and Rigby screams)

Mordecai: Come on!

(Mordecai and Rigby run out of Pops' house and watches it get sucked up)

Rigby: What's going on??

Mordecai: Don't you get it? It's the fortunes! Benson's luck is getting so bad it's gonna destroy everything, look!

(Benson is being sucked in, but is holding onto a lamppost)

Mordecai: Benson! Take my hand!

(A black cat hits Benson's face and Benson loses grip of the lamppost)

Mordecai: Nooooo!

Rigby: Aw, man! (Benson gets sucked in) Okay, okay, I'll switch back!

Mordecai: Where's the fortune?

Rigby: It's under my trampoline!

(The trampoline is being sucked in, and the fortune is sticky taped under the trampoline)

Mordecai: Oh man. How are we supposed to get over there?

(A man in an orange car arrives in front of Mordecai and Rigby)

Man: What are you guys doing? You gotta get out of here! Here! (tosses Rigby his car keys) Take my car! (screams and runs away and jumps off the 'island', but gets sucked in too)

Mordecai: Give me the keys.

(Mordecai starts the ignition of the car and drives up to the trampoline dodging the flying park objects)

Mordecai: Almost there!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump out of the car, which gets shredded by the merry go round. Mordecai and Rigby scream but land on spring rocking toys. Rigby reaches for the trampoline and jumps on the trampoline. He tears the fortune off and tries to give it to Benson)

Rigby: Benson! We gotta trade fortunes!

Benson: Why bother? Another bad thing is just gonna happen.

Rigby: No Benson! All these bad things are happening because of me! I switched fortunes behind your back at the Chinese restaurant!

Benson: You what?

Rigby: I was jealous of all the good luck you've been having so I gave you all my bad luck! I'm sorry.

(Benson takes out his fortune and swaps it with Rigby's. The fortunes glow and the scenery is clear again. Mordecai, Rigby and Benson are back on the park ground and look around themselves)

Rigby: Is it over?

Mordecai: I think so..

Rigby: Ah, good.

Benson: (to Rigby) OVER?! Nothing's over! You switched my fortune! Do you have any idea what I went through?!

Rigby: Alright alright, I'm sorry! At least I confessed, that's gotta count for something (the broken mobile phone rings and Rigby picks it up). Hello?

Dante: Yeah this is Dante from Video Game Monthly. Yeah uh, so looks like I gotta cancel your interview.

Rigby: Aw, what?

Dante: Sorry, got a new hot player here. He's tearing through all the records!

(Scene changes to Dante with Muscle Man in the background breaking the records of Super Donkey Bros, twirling his shirt around with a crowd behind him)

Muscle Man: Woooo! Wooo! You know who else is hot and tears through stuff? MY MOM!

(Flashback to the park members at the Good Luck Restaurant when Benson and Rigby get up and walk away. The waitress places a plate of 3 fortune cookies on the table)

Benson: I'm telling ya, I can't lose! (gets up and walks away)

Rigby: I gotta go dry off (gets up and walks away)

Waitress: Here are your fortune cookies.

Muscle Man: (opens fortune cookie) You know what's a hilarious game? Saying your fortunes and saying 'in the back of a car'. (reads the fortune) "Bad luck is coming your way in the-" Uh, that's not gonna work.

(Muscle Man sees one unopened fortune cookie left and swaps fortunes)

High Five Ghost: Hey, that's Rigby's fortune!

Muscle Man: So? "You're gonna be on the cover of Video Game Monthly". In the back of a car.

(Muscle Man and High Five Ghost laugh)

Rigby (voice): Finally my fortune cookie's here! At least one good thing will come from this meal.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost laugh again.)

(End of Fortune Cookie)

Rigby: Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man! Mordecai, check it out! I found it in the trash in the back. Isn't it cool?

(Rigby brings a cracked plate decorated with a face and words SIMON KIPNER GODFATHER OF THE SOUL PATCH)

Mordecai: Dude, you gotta stop pulling stuff out of the trash. It's unnatural.

Rigby: You're unnatural! Besides, this is different. It's a treasure from the past.

Mordecai: It is a pretty sweet plate.

Rigby: We should put some food on this baby!

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Agreed. You know what would look great on this plate? Chocolate cake!

Rigby: Ahhhhh, yes. But how can we afford something as good as chocolate cake?

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. I think I know where we can get one.

(Mordecai and Rigby are at the grocery store)

Mordecai (continued): Check it, dude. Cake mix. Add some water, slap it in the oven, pull that greasy pig out and BAM! You've got yourself a cake, baby.

Rigby: I can't wait to eat that greasy pig. Wait, how much does it cost?

Mordecai: (Looks at the box) A buck fifty.

Mordecai & Rigby: Aaaargh!

Rigby: I told you cake mix is too expensive.

(Mordecai and Rigby go to a wedding)

Doorman: Do you know the bride or the groom?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhhh..

Mordecai: The one with the cake?

(The doorman shuts the door)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugghhh!!

(Mordecai and Rigby go to the free store)

Cashier at the free store: Yeah, we don't have cakes.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan, scene cuts to the house)

Mordecai: (Sighs) Well, I'm all out of ideas.

Rigby: Ooh! I got it! There's that chocolate cake at the snack bar!

Mordecai: Yeah. But, Benson will only let you have it for free if it's your birthday.

Rigby: Who's to say it's not my birthday?

Mordecai: Who's to say it's not my birthday?

Mordecai & Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Benson: It's neither of your birthdays.

Rigby: Aw, man! He's killing us with that!

Mordecai & Rigby: (Sadly) No cake. No cake.

Pops: But it is Skips' birthday.

Mordecai & Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Benson: But he's really private about it.

Mordecai & Rigby: (Sadly) No cake. No cake.

Benson: Come to think of it, I don't think we've ever had a party for Skips.

Pops: If memory serves, Skips secludes himself in the woods every year on the day of his birth.

Mordecai: So, wait? You guys have never thrown a party for Skips?

Benson: No.

Mordecai: Dude, that sucks. Skips totally deserves a party.

Rigby: (Who interrupts) And cake.

Mordecai: Whenever something goes wrong, it's Skips who fixes it. Hes always there for us, no matter what. I bet Skips wants a party, but he's such a quiet guy he doesn't know how to ask. We owe him a party.

Rigby: And also a cake.

Pops: Woo! Good show, jolly good show! Benson, a soiree for Skips, what a crackerjack idea!

Benson: You're right. Fine. If you two get Skips on board, we'll throw a party for him.

Mordecai: Oh, we know how to get him on board.

(We cut back to the house) 

Mordecai (continued): Okay. How will we get him on board?

Rigby: Oh, I know! Let's get a van.

(Dream Mordecai and Dream Rigby throw an unconscious Dream Skips into a van) 

Dream Rigby: Happy birthday, Skips. 

Rigby: BAM! Free cake!

Mordecai: No, dude. Thats kidnapping.

Rigby: But we can't just tell him. You heard Benson, Skips isn't into this stuff.

Mordecai: I know, but dude, Skips is cool. We should just go and tell him we gonna throw him a party.

Rigby: Argh, laaaame!

Mordecai: What? What's wrong with that?

Rigby: Two things: one, no surprise, and two, no vans.

Mordecai: (gasp) That's it.

Rigby: What, vans?

Mordecai: No, Surprise. Dude, we should throw Skips a surprise party!

Rigby: Dude, that's perfect!

Mordecai: Yeah, I know. 'Cause no one can say NO to a surprise party.

Rigby: 'Cause they can't.

Mordecai and Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Skips: No, I don't wanna hang out with you guys at 8 o'clock tonight.

Mordecai: Well, then... How about later tonight?

Skips: No! I wanna be left alone!

Mordecai: Argh, man. What would we do now?

Rigby: Dude, Check it. We'll just lie to Benson and get the cake first, and figure out the Skips part later.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Sounds like a cake worthy idea to me.

Mordecai and Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Mordecai: Skips totally wants a birthday party.

Benson: Really? How did you convince him?

Mordecai: We told him there's gonna be cake.

Rigby: Yeah, he wants an extra-large chocolate one.

Benson: Really?

Mordecai: Yeah. 8:00. His place.

Rigby: But he wants it to be a surprise, so if you see him, don't say anything. (Mordecai punches Rigby.) Ow!

Benson: Okay. Here's the key to the cake in the snack bar. I guess Ill see you at 8. But if you morons are lying to me, you'll be on dish duty for the next month!!

Mordecai: We did it!

Rigby: Let's eat it!

Mordecai: No! You heard Benson. Do you wanna be on dish duty?

Rigby: Arghhhhhhh, fine. We'll do dish duty.

Mordecai: No, dude. We have to get Skips.

(Mordecai and Rigby walk through the woods. Rigby carries the cake.)

Rigby: Are you sure Skips is even here?

Mordecai: Pops said Skips secludes himself in the woods. Where else should we look? (Rigby's stomach rumbles.) Don't touch that cake.

Rigby: It's a medical emergency.

Mordecai: You just ate a sandwich.

Rigby: Are you a doctor now? Did you go to medical school in the past 5 minutes?

Mordecai: We're saving it for the party, and that's THAT.

(Mordecai takes the cake from Rigby.)

(At Skips place.)

Benson: Do you see them?

Pops: Not yet.

Benson: Hit the lights. It's almost 8 p.m.

Muscle Man: Whooooo! Skips is gonna be so surprised when he comes in and sees us totally naked.

Benson: It's not that kind of party, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: Ohhhh... Don't turn on the lights.

(In the woods.)

Rigby: Ohhhh, man, it's almost 8. We're not gonna find him, let's just eat it.

Mordecai: No. Benson's gonna get pissed, so we shouldnt. (In reruns, the line is changed to "Benson's gonna get ticked, so we shouldn't.")

Rigby: Benson's gonna get like that no matter what. (Grabs the cake from Mordecai.) Better to have no regrets.

Mordecai: Dude! No! (Grabs the cake back. Rigby jumps on Mordecai trying to get the cake.) RIGBY! GET OFF! (Mordecai throws Rigby off and tries to run away with the cake, but Rigby gets him. They fight over the cake.) Dude! Quit it! You're ruining the cake! (A mysterious sound is heard.) Wait. What's that? Sounds like some kind of weird Aztec ritual... (Mordecai and Rigby stop fighting. While Mordecai was puzzling over the sound Rigby sneakily obtained the cake.) I think it's coming from over there. We should go to check it out.

Rigby: That's funny. Usually, if there's a strange noise in the woods, you don't check it out. Mordecai? (They see Skips singing and jumping around a blue-colored bonfire with a big rattle.) What's Skips doing?

Mordecai: I don't know. But it looks kind of important. Maybe we should leave him alone.

Rigby: What about the cake?

Mordecai: Would you forget about the cake for a minute? Rigby!

(Rigby interrupts Skips.)

Rigby: You're coming with us, Skips!

Skips: What are you doing?!? (The bonfire goes out.) Fools! You interrupted my spirit dance! You don't realize what you've done!

(A white pickup lands near them.)

Gary: Skips. You have broken the pact with the Guardians of Youth.

Skips: Gary, You don't have to do this!

Gary: Listen. I'm just doing my job.

(Both teleport into the pickup.)

Mordecai: Wait! Where are you taking him?

Gary: I'm only the chauffeur.

(The pickup leaves.)

Mordecai: Dude, I think we just screwed Skips!

Rigby: And ourselves! No Skips, no cake!

Mordecai: Come on. We better follow him. (They jump into the trunk. The pickup arrives onto a sandy island in the space.) Dude. What the...

Rigby: Dude. What's with the babies? We've got to get Skips back to the park.

Mordecai: Shh! Shut up!

Gary: Guardians of Eternal Youth. I have brought you the condemned.

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Skips. You have failed to complete the Spirit Dance. And thus the pact you made with us for eternal youth has been broken. Now you shall shrivel into dust and disappear, Forever.

(The Guardians of Eternal Youth blast Skips with energy beams. Skips turns very old and collapses to the ground.)

Mordecai and Rigby: SKIPS!!!!!

(Skips starts crumbling to dust.)

Mordecai: Wait! It's not his fault!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: What's done is done.

Mordecai: But this is our fault! We interrupted the dance before he could finish!

Rigby: Yeah, man. Let him finish that dance thing!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: The decision of the Guardians cannot be overturned.

(Skips continues crumbling to dust.)

Mordecai & Rigby: SKIPS!!!!!

Mordecai: We're sorry, Skips.

Rigby: Yeah, we're sorry.

Mordecai: (sniffles) We just wanna to throw you a surprise party.

Rigby: Yeah. It was going to be really cool. We were gonna eat cake...

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Cake? Did someone say cake?

Rigby: No. Theres no cake.

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Wait, brothers. I smell cake. Do you smell it as well?

Guardian of Eternal Youth 2: I smell cake.

Guardian of Eternal Youth 3: As do I! Cake! Cake!

Mordecai: Wait. You guys like cake?

Guardians of Eternal Youth: Yes! Yes! We love it!

Mordecai: Give me the cake, dude.

Rigby: No way!

(Mordecai grabs the cake from Rigby.)

Mordecai: So, you're telling me you like cake?

Guardian of Eternal Youth: The blue one has cake. Cake. Give us the cake!

Mordecai: Nah, The cake for Skips.

Rigby: Mordecai, what are you doing?

Mordecai: Dude. Do you want Skips to die on his birthday?

(Skips is almost dead.)

Rigby: Alright.

Mordecai: Do we have a deal?

(Guardians of Youth decide to debate a situation.)

Guardian of Eternal Youth: What flavor is it?

Mordecai: Chocolate.

Guardian of Eternal Youth: We have reached a new decision. We will restore Skips' youth in exchange, for your cake.

(Mordecai puts the cake on the ground.)

Mordecai: Now change him back!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Done!

(Skips returns back to normal. Guardians of Youth start smearing themselves with the cake.)

Rigby: Aw, what? They are not even eating it! They're just smushing it on their faces!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Be gone with you.

(Mordecai, Rigby and Skips disappear and materialize at Skips' place.)

Benson, Pops, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost: Surprise!

Pops: Let the merry making commence! (laughs)

Skips: You guys almost killed me for some cake?

Rigby: Hey, Skips. We've got you a birthday present. (Rigby gives Skips the plate he found in a trash.) It says: SKIPS --- GODFATHER OF SOUL.

Skips: No one's ever thrown me a birthday party before. Thanks.

Benson: So, where's the cake?

Mordecai: Ahh, cake?

Rigby: I don't remember anything about cake.

Mordecai: Me neither.

Rigby: Must be a misunderstanding.

Mordecai: Oh, The cake from the snack bar.

Rigby: You wanted that cake for this party?

Mordecai: Ha-ha-ha! Oh, man! I mean what a mix-up, right?

Rigby: The important thing is we are all together.

Benson: Argh. I knew I couldn't trust you idiots. You're lucky Pops brought a spare. Happy birthday, Skips.

Mordecai: Ha-ha! Yes! Finally! (Takes a piece of the cake.) Argh, Vanilla...?

(End of Free Cake)


(Episode begins in the Phone Home area, located in the Space Tree Station. Benson is calling Pam.)

Pam: Listen, Benson. We need to talk.

Benson: We are talking. Ooh, wanna hear how many pushups I did at training today?

Pam: No, we need to really talk.

Benson: Oh, okay.

Pam: This...this isn't working for me anymore.

Benson: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Pam: Benson, you're a great guy, but I have no idea when you're coming back, or-or if you're coming back.

Benson: Sure, sure.

Pam: You know, statistically, the further away two mates are from each other, the less likely it is that their realationship will last. I've done the calculations, and our odds *sniffles* are only 1.35%.

Benson: Mm-hmm.

Pam: I'm...I'm-I'm sorry, Benson. It's not you, it's just...math. I think we should just be friends.

Benson: I get it. I was sent millions of miles into space against my will, you're back on Earth...

Pam: Are you sure you're okay?

Benson: I totally understand. I am good.

(Cut to Benson, he didn't take the breakup very good as he starts crying hysterically, surrounded by chicken wing mess.)

Benson (continued): Pa-a-am!! Why?!

(He slumps down splattering wing sauce and continues crying. Mordecai and Rigby come walking in.)

Rigby: Okay, okay, okay. My turn.

Mordecai: Hmm-hmm-hmm.

Rigby: Would your rather have spaghetti for fingers, or have spiders crawl out of your mouth every time you yawn?

Mordecai: Hm. That's a good one. If I eat my spaghetti fingers, do they grow back?

Rigby: Yes, but they're whole wheat pasta.

Mordecai: Aw sick, dude! Well, in that case, I gotta go with- uhh...

(The two notice Benson depressingly eating wings.)

Mordecai (continued): Uh-oh.

(Sympathetic, M&R walk up to Benson.)

Mordecai (continued): Um, hey, buddy. Everything okay, man?

(Benson finishes sucking on a chicken bone.)

Benson: No. Pam dumped me. I've been eating all these wings, but they're not making me feel any better.

Rigby: Hey, wait. Didn't you and Pam eat wings on your first date?

(Benson widens his pupils in realization.)

Benson: Oh nooooooooo! That's why they're not working! They're just making me think about Pam!

Mordecai: Whoa, whoa! Forget about wings.

Rigby: Yeah, these space wings are wack anyways. We know what'll make you feel better.

Benson: What?

Mordecai & Rigby: Umm...frriiiiiiieeeeee...Fries!

Benson: Fries?

Mordecai: Crispy, delicious fries! I'm talkin' curly!

Rigby: Crisp cut!

Mordecai: Wedge cut!

Rigby: Crinkle cut!

Mordecai: Shoe-string!

Rigby: Artisanal salt, yo!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops are working, Pops is laughing)

Pops: Oh! 

(Pops sees a man running) 

Pops: Mordecai! Rigby! Why was that man running? Nobody seems to be chasing him!

Rigby: I don't know, Pops. Why does anyone do anything in this crazy world?

Mordecai: He's probably on a fun run, you know? Just running for the fun of it!

Pops: Fun run? (his eyes inflate) Run for fun...!

Rigby: Hey Pops, hand me that other bag of mulch, will you? 

(there is no response)

Rigby: Pops?

(Pops' hose is just spraying water all over the ground)

(We cut to Pops tying his shoes, putting on headphones and switching on a tape called Beloved Musical Jams)

("I Ran" by A Flock of Seagulls plays as Pops runs, Mordecai and Rigby wave at him, he passes Skips and Benson, who look at him and smile, he passes Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, Fives waves, and Muscle Man salutes and swings his shirt, Pops starts running through a load of streets, Frank Smith is in Chopper 6, he puts his thumb up to Pops, who then puts his thumb up to Frank, we see smoke come from Pops' shoes, revealing the other park workers, in 80s costumes and playing instruments, Mordecai is singing, Rigby is on the guitar, as well as Muscle Man, Skips is on the keyboard, and Benson on drums, a light comes out of Skips' eyes, then Mordecai blows and it transfers into the next scene, where Pops is still running, a woman in a red car passes him and winks, then drives forward as her scarf blows towards Pops, Pops runs passed multiple people, we then see Pops running in the rain, a rainbow shines through the clouds, Pops looks up and smiles, he runs up the rainbow and appears in space, then runs down the rainbow, we cut to Pops, still running, but very tired, he rubs his eyes, and gets faster, we then cut back to the other park workers, still playing "I Ran", we see Eileen dancing too, Skips then pulls an Overdrive lever, and everybody jumps, as the screen freezes, breaks up and cuts back to Pops, animals, such as a deer, eagle and wolf pass Pops to give him food and drink, day turns to night as Pops grows a beard, Pops is then seen running on a boat passing the Statue of Liberty in New York, then he runs up and down the Grand Canyon, and passes Mount Rushmore, where the Faces of the Past Presidents widen their eyes and watch Pops, he is then seen running out of a restroom, on an exercise machine, Pops is then seen running across some mountains, as more people follow him, Pops reaches a dock, where he stops running, spreads his arms out, and gets carried away by a flock of seagulls, a man widens his eyes while staring at him, all of Pops' clothes then come flying off in the wind, and his shorts hit the man in the face, as we see Pops in the distance being carried away, the song ends, everybody walks away, and the faces of the park workers appears at the side of the ocean)

(Benson's office, interior, day. Mordecai and Rigby walk in when all the other groundskeepers are sitting down)

Benson: Ugh, finally! Could you close the door, please?

Rigby: Yeah, close the door!

Mordecai: (pushes Rigby) Just sit down! (closes door and goes to sit down as Benson begins to speak)

Benson: As you guys may or may not know, it's Pops' birthday tomorrow. (flips page on easel to reveal the words "Pops' Birthday) I was planning on getting him something nice from the arts and crafts fair last Saturday, but, nothing really stood out. Has anybody gotten him anything yet?

Muscle Man: No.

Benson: Why am I not surprised? (pulls cap off of the  marker) Ideas? Anybody?

Muscle Man: How about one of them Jeff Forgeman grills?

Benson: That's actually not a bad idea, but Pops has been watching his cholesterol. Doctor's orders. What else?

Skips: How about we get him some new gardening tools?

Benson: Well, maybe. It's just, he gets new gardening tools all the time.

Mordecai: What about some horseback riding lessons?

Benson: Please tell me you're joking.

Mordecai: Well, no. Isn't he into that?

Benson: Don't you remember? That's the exact same gift we got him last year.

Rigby: Psht.

Mordecai: Don't "psht" me. I don't hear you coming up with anything.

Rigby: Yeah, but at least I didn't say the same thing that we got him last year.

Pops: (from outside, knocking on door) Hello? May I please enter?

Benson: Just a second! (flips page on easel back onto the blank sheet) Okay. You can come in now.

Pops: (opens door) Ooh! What's everybody doing in here?

Benson: Oh, hey Pops. We were just, uh... going over the schedule.

Muscle Man: No! (to Pops) We were talking about how no one knows what to get you for your birthday.

Pops: Oh!

Benson: Muscle Man, what are you doing?!

Muscle Man: I'm saying what's on my mind, bro. I'm just real like that.

Pops: You want to know what to get me for my birthday? Well, that's quite simple.

Benson: What is it, Pops?

Pops: A pair of fuzzy dice from the Fun Fun Zone.

Rigby: Fuzzy dice?

Pops: Yes! They're so much fun! (sadly) But alas, the only way to get them is to win a million tickets. I'm afraid I'm not very good at throwing Skeeze Ballz. (He walks away.)

Benson: Well, fuzzy dice it is.

Rigby: Yeah, but I'm not going to the Fun Fun Zone.

Mordecai: Yeah, me neither. I can't stand that place. All those nasty kids...

Muscle Man: Yeah, and talk about sub-standard pizza.

Rigby: And what about that annoying animatronic band? (Everyone agrees with him.)

Benson: Alright, alright. Look, I don't like the Fun Fun Zone any more than you do. (close up of face) But if Pops wants those fuzzy dice, then we're gonna get him those fuzzy dice!

(cut to a bird's eye view of the Fun Fun Zone, accompanied by a sound of an explosion. On the inside, the groundskeepers, minus Pops, enter, and look at all the bad stuff about it: the animatronic band, "Dance Like a Loser 3," the pizza, the kids laughing, two kids slapping a third kid with pizza while atop a car statue, and two kids passed out on top of an ice cream stand)

Benson: Let's get this over with.

(The groundskeepers attempt to walk on in, but are stopped by a female employee.)

Employee: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me! Where do you think you're going?

Mordecai: We're just here to get some fuzzy dice.

Employee: I'm sorry, but you must accompany at least one child to enter.

Mordecai: Aw, come on! We'll just buy the dice and leave.

Employee: Oh, I can't bend the rules for you, sir. Because it just wouldn't be a "Fun Fun Zone" without fun fun rules.

(cut to the exterior of the Fun Fun Zone. The groundskeepers are walking out)

Muscle Man: Man, how are we supposed to get this stupid dice now?

Skips: I think I have an idea.

(clock transition to the interior of the Fun Fun Zone. With Rigby hidden, the groundskeepers try to get in again, but the employee tries to stop them)

Employee: Hey, I already told you that you need a kid to get in! (The groundskeepers walk to the side to reveal Rigby dressed in a backward-facing hat, sweatshirt, pouch and sneakers. There is silence for a few seconds, then, Mordecai punches Rigby)

Rigby: What's up, man? (repeatedly zips and unzips pouch, while saying "LOL!" in sync with the zipping).

Employee: (suspiciously) Hmm... (perks up) Okay! Go on in, folks! (unhooks velvet rope) Have a great time!

(The groundskeepers walk into the main Fun Fun Zone as electro-music starts playing. While walking in, Benson steps on a slice of pizza)

Benson: Ugh! (gets pushed by kids) Hey!

Mordecai: Let's just find the dice and get out of here.

(The groundskeepers go over to a prize center, run by a man named Diego Montez.)

Diego Montez: May I help you?

Benson: Yeah, hi. We'd like a pair of fuzzy dice, please.

Diego Montez: That'll be one million tickets.

Benson: (sarcastically laughs) No. (pulls out wallet) We're actually gonna be paying with cash. (pulls out dollar bill) How much is that gonna be? Ten, fifteen bucks?

Diego Montez: One million tickets, sir. If you like, all of our price listings for our items are on the wall.

Muscle Man: Well, can we just buy the tickets?

Diego Montez: Tickets are a penny each. (The groundskeepers all groan.)

Rigby: Nice, what's that, like, ten bucks?

Mordecai: Dude, it's not ten bucks. It's ten thousand dollars.

Rigby: Wow, really?

Benson: (turns to the other groundskeepers) Alright, bad news, everybody. We're gonna to have to win some tickets if we're gonna get those dice.

Skips: Uh, yeah, we were right here the whole time.

Muscle Man: It's go time!

(Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Hi Five Ghost, Muscle Man and Skips all six-way high-five as we clock transition to a montage of the gang playing the games. First, Rigby plays air hockey. He beats three kids: one in a blue shirt, one in a blue sweatshirt, and another in braces, the last of which cries as Rigby dances while the tickets print out of the slot. Next, Mordecai is seen playing Skeeze Ballz. We're given trippy imagery of another Mordecai being added every time he rolls the ball into the hole in the center, up to three Mordecais. After that, we see a shot of a Skeeze Ball being rolled up the ramp, and turning into a token that gets entered into a slot when the ball goes airborne. Then, we see Skips playing a game called "T-Nuggets." Skips smashes the nuggets with a mallet every time one comes up, eventually smashing the machine with it. Then, we see Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost playing Dance Like a Loser 3. When they start, they dance [though Hi Five Ghost uses his hands] as the image goes into a grid view that eventually turns into six views of Muscle Man & Hi Five Ghost playing. Finally, we have a shot of the animatronic band followed by a shot of the groundskeepers doing another six-way high-five under the words "Fuzzy Dice." When the montage ends in a clock transition, we find that they have, so far, earned 980,000 tickets)

Benson: Alright, guys, I got some bad news. We're 20,000 tickets short of the fuzzy dice. And what's worse, is that we only have one token left. But I've noticed one game that gives out more tickets than all the others.

(cut to the Skeeze Ballz game. Dramatic music plays as we pan up to the name)

Benson: Skeeze Ballz. This will have to be a team effort. (points out the timer and the balls) The faster we go, the more chances to throw the balls we get. So I want everyone to line up, and when the balls drop-- (M&R laugh at the sexual innuendo. Benson facepalms.) Ugh... when the game starts, you throw, and get back in line. (close up of face) Now let's roll!

(Benson inserts a token, and the game starts. He throws the ball up the ramp, followed by Rigby, and Mordecai, who score 3,000, 5,000 and 5,000, respectively. Skips then throws his ball, followed by Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, who score higher scores of 10,000 and 15,000. The timer shows that there are five seconds left)

Benson: Hurry!

(Rigby takes another throw, but the ball bounces away. There's three seconds left, and 990,000 points scored)

Benson: Come on, Mordecai, sink it!

(Mordecai rolls the ball up the ramp with two seconds left on the clock. The ball dangles on a 10,000 hole as the others gasp. The ball then falls in, totaling one million, with no time to spare. The groundskeepers celebrate as the tickets start printing. Twenty minutes later, the tickets are still printing as the groundskeepers look on, bored. When the tickets stop printing, we cut to the prize booth)

Benson: (drops tickets on stand) One million tickets.

Diego Montez: What would you like?

Benson: We'll take the fuzzy dice. (the groundskeepers cheer as Diego grabs a pole with a hook) For Pops. (Diego removes the lid with the hook, and grabs the dice, then, gives them to Benson) Yeah! We did it! Now, we can give these to Pops.

(Having somehow come off the stage, along with the other animatronic band members, the bear robot grabs the dice out of Benson's hand)

Bear Robot: Sorry, but you ain't giving nothing to nobody.

(the groundskeepers question the animatronics' actions. Then, the bear pulls out a remote, extends the antenna and presses the button, causing a car to fall from the ceiling after the support explodes)

Mordecai: Aw, what?! (the animatronics get in the car and drive off the stage and through the wall of the Fun Fun Zone as the groundskeepers watch) Let's get 'em!

Muscle Man: WHOOO!

(The groundskeepers run into the golf cart and drive into the street, crossing right in front of another car. The animatronics continue to drive on, cutting in front of cars and running red lights. The bear robot looks through the rear view mirror, seeing the golf cart. The chase continues onto a bridge as the animatronic named Louie looks back at the cart, then, picks up a drum and throws it at the cart. They dodge it as the drum explodes on the road)

Mordecai: Give us back the dice! (rams side of cart into the band's car twice)

Muscle Man: Give us...the...dice! (jumps off of cart, onto the band's car. Louie punches Muscle Man in the jaw. Weakly, he tries to reach for the dice, but is elbowed by the duck robot)

Duck Robot: Back off, creep!

(the bear robot opens the door as he is still driving, leaving Muscle Man dangling inches above the road. He squeals. Then, we get a bird's eye view of the bridge. A truck is approaching both vehicles. Muscle Man screams on the sight of it. Just as he is about to be hit, Skips yanks him off the door, letting the truck pass between the two vehicles. Back in the band's car, the bear robot laughs looking at the dice as he heads to a dock)

Benson: They're getting away!

(Mordecai grabs the gear and resumes driving)

Rigby: Through there!

(Mordecai drives to the dock the band are at. On the dock, the band continue their getaway. The bear robot is having trouble with the brake)

Duck Robot: Stop the car!

Bear Robot: I'm trying! (looks ahead and sees a pile of barrels. The robot avoids the pile, but rams the car into a streetlight. The car then bursts into flames. They are unconscious for a moment. Louie sees that his cheek has been destroyed. The bear robot wakes up and grabs the dice) Go, go, go! (the robots waddle away from the burning car, but seconds later, it explodes. The groundskeepers see the explosion)

Rigby: What was that?!

(They continue to drive to the dock. When they see the band, the cart stops, and the groundskeepers all jump out of the cart.)

Mordecai: Give us back our dice! We won them fair and square!

Bear Robot: There's no way you're getting these dice. (points away) Now get out of the way before somebody gets hurt!

Benson: What could you possibly want with fuzzy dice?

Louie: Well, ten years ago, we knocked over Big City Jewelers, and made off with millions worth of uncut diamonds. (points to dice) Those diamonds are in those dice.

Bear Robot: (slaps Louie) Shut up, Louie!

Benson: I remember reading about that! That was you?

Bear Robot: Yeah, that's right. We've been laying low for ten long years waiting for the statute of limitations on grand theft larceny to run out. And it was supposed to end tonight at midnight.

Duck Robot: Mm-hmm. Until you clowns came along and ruined everything!

Rigby: Can't we just have the dice without the diamonds?

Bear Robot: It's too late. And you know too much.

Duck Robot: Mm-hmm.

(Muscle Man leaps for the dice and yanks them out of the bear robot's hands)

Bear Robot: Hey, give that back! (Muscle Man throws the dice to Skips, who throws it past the band, and to Rigby, who was running to catch them) Alright! No more games! (reaches into jacket)

Rigby: No, don't! (a light shines onto the bear robot)

FBI Agent: This is the FBI. You're surrounded! (we get a view of the FBI helicopter, vehicles and agents) Get on the ground, now!

Pilot: (as agent packs heat with a sniper, laying on ground) Targets are considered hostile, repeat, targets are considered hostile. (loads up)

FBI Sniper: (crosshair view) Copy that, red leader.

Louie: Uh, what do we do, boss?

Bear Robot: We do what we were made to do: show these folks a fun time.

Duck Robot: Hm. Funny, I was thinking the exact same thing. (Louie whimpers)

Bear Robot: Well then, I guess it's showtime! (pulls out gun)

FBI Agent: Gun! (the FBI shoots the bear robot down. Rigby runs to the cart while being chased by the bullets of the duck robot's gun)

Duck Robot: Eat lead, sucker!

(the gunsmen shoot the duck robot, causing her to fall of the dock and into a boat. Louie fires at the gunsmen, but not one bullet hits him at first. Then, a man launches a rocket at Louie, which finally hits him. Louie then blows up, along with the rocket. A gunsman sees a pole on the ground. The bear robot, having survived his shots, picks up the pole and lets out a war cry as the groundskeepers watch in horror. The gunsmen then fire several more shots until a man with a mini gun comes out firing, the bullets falling as he shoots the robot. The machine gun bullets finally knock him into a boat. His head knocks a gear, which causes the boat to go across the ocean as the searchlight of a helicopter watches from above)

Pilot: Smoke 'em.

(A man carrying a rocket launcher fires at the boat, which hits and destroys the boat. The groundskeepers watch in shock, then, jump into the air and high-five into a freeze-frame. We then show a closing montage set to the song "Don't You (Forget About Me)" by Simple Minds)

Text: Benson and the guys got the fuzzy dice after the FBI retrieved the uncut diamonds from them. The whereabouts of the Capicola Gang are currently unknown. Though there have been sightings reported all across the lower 48. Diego Montez quit his job at the Fun Fun Zone 3 1/2 weeks later...and became a multi-millionaire after patenting his ergonomic reaching hook. Pops received the fuzzy dice for his birthday and loved them. So did Muscle Man. ...A little too much.

(The montage ends as we cut to black. End of Fuzzy Dice)

(Episode starts at Pops' House. Rigby is laying on the living room sofa with his eyes wide open. Mordecai bursts through the door)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(Rigby screams and rises up)

Rigby: Agh! Don't do that!

(Mordecai puts a box on the table)

Mordecai: Dude, you gotta stop sleeping with your eyes open. It's creepy.

Rigby: Whatever, it's totally natu-

(Rigby glances into the box)

Rigby: -oh, what!? A Tonare 3500 console!? Where did you get this?

Mordecai: I found it in my parents' house, and look what else I found.

(Mordecai passes Rigby a video game)

Rigby: What? Tim and Mark's Golden Badge Secret Adventure! We never got passed Level 65 because we were dumb kids who didn't know how to play video games!

Mordecai: Oh, I bet we can get passed Level 65 now.

Rigby: Oh, I bet we can beat the whole game right now.

Mordecai: Plus it's Saturday, so we won't even get into trouble.

(A very short montage is shown of Mordecai and Rigby unplugging their usual console, and plugging in the Tonare 3500)

Video Game: Tonare!

Mordecai & Rigby: So many memories.

("Tim and Mark's Golden Badge Search Adventure" loads on the screen)

Rigby: Hmph, hmph! This is only gonna take twenty minutes tops.

(10 Hours Later. Mordecai and Rigby are still playing the game)

Rigby: What's that?

Mordecai: Dude, it's the final boss. We're gonna beat it! One...two...three!

(They defeat the final boss)

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOHHHHH!!! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

(The TV screen seems to have additional content on it)

Mordecai: Huh?

(An 8-bit character resembling the in-universe game designer Maury Moto walks along their screen. Mordecai gasps)

Mordecai: It's legendary game designer, Maury Moto!

Maury: Congratulations. You are a super player. Claim your golden badge here.

(Their TV screen displays an 8-bit platform-type map of a real world location)

Rigby: Whoa, wait! They're real!? Golden game badges are real!?

Mordecai: Dude, take a picture! We gotta save the map!

(Rigby runs up to the TV with a camera and takes a picture. Unfortunately, the photograph is bad quality only features a portion of the map)

Rigby: Oh, man! The pixels make it look all weird.

(Skips enters the room)

Mordecai: What are we gonna do?

Rigby: Skips!

Skips: Yeah?

Rigby: Do you know some kind of magical ritual thing we can use to bring the TV with us and keep it on?

Skips: You got a car battery?

(A short montage of Skips connecting a car battery to the TV and taping it down to a wheeled table)

Mordecai & Rigby: Whoa...

Rigby: Skips! Do you have any other magic tricks that can take us to this address?

Skips: You got any gas money?

(Short montage of Skips taking Mordecai and Rigby to the actual location of the map in his van. Mordecai and Rigby wheel the TV away from Skips' van)

Mordecai: Good to go. Thanks Skips!

Skips: Eh, I had some free time. It's a Saturday!

(Skips beeps his horn and drives off)

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmph, hmph!

Mordecai: Okay, so the map starts here. It says we need to look for a lighthouse?

(Mordecai and Rigby look around)

Rigby: I don't see a lighthouse.

Mordecai: Wait, what about that hot dog stand?

(Mordecai and Rigby turn the TV towards a hot dog stand next to a lighthouse. Rigby gasps)

Rigby: It totally matches!

Mordecai: Awesome.

Rigby: Then that means we have to go to...this blob here!

(Mordecai and Rigby follow the distance between the lighthouse and the blob in the real life)

Rigby: Blob, blob, blob, blob, blob, blob, blob, blob - BLOB!

(They see a mall)

Mordecai & Rigby: The mall!

(Mordecai and Rigby pull out some sunglasses)

Mordecai: Hmph, it's time to go shopping.

(They both put on their sunglasses and move towards the mall. Meanwhile at the Park, Benson is measuring some sprinkler heads)

Benson: Two centimetres short. Looks like I just booked a ticket to the hardware store.

(Benson gets in his car, and inserts the keys, but for some reason his car won't turn on. He sighs and moves towards the front of his car to check the engine)

Benson: Let's just see what the problem is and go from there.

(Benson opens his car up and sees that his car battery is missing, with a note attached saying "I.O.U. one car battery - Mordecai & Rigby")

Benson: Mordecai and Rigby!!

(His voice echoes as the scene cuts back to Mordecai and Rigby at the Coast Mall. They enter the mall with their sunglasses on)

Mordecai: Actually, this is kinda dark.

(They take their sunglasses off as a man with a clipboard walks towards them)

Petition Guy: Hey, do you wanna sign this petition to help fund stronger cli-

Rigby: Agh, no!

(Mordecai and Rigby move on with the TV through the mall)

Rigby: Well now where are we supposed to go? This mall's huge!

Mordecai: Yeah, I'm surprised there's enough foot traffic to sustain it out here in the boonies like this. Let me ask the game.

(Mordecai pulls the joystick on the Tonare 3500. 8-bit Maury Moto shows up again)

Maury: If you've found the village store, follow your heart for one hundred paces to reveal the next step in your journey.

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmm...

(Mordecai and Rigby look around the food court and notice a love test arcade machine in the corner. Mordecai gasps)

Mordecai: Follow your heart for one hundred paces! But, that's through the food court.

Rigby: I have an old trick for situations like this.

(Mordecai and Rigby shove through the tables of the food court knocking people over)

Rigby: Excuse me! Sorry, whoops! Look out!

Mordecai: We have to go in a straight line, sorry! Sorry!

(Mordecai and Rigby reach the love test, but it's a dead end)

Mordecai & Rigby: Huh?

Mordecai: Dead end?

(Mordecai attempts to use the love test machine to hopefully open up a secret doorway, but it doesn't work)

Mordecai: This machine doesn't even work! How many paces have you gone?

Rigby: How many whats?

Mordecai: Augh!

(The scene changes to outside the mall, where Skips is suddenly back, outside his van, and Benson is there too, confronting the worker at the hot dog stand while snapping his fingers)

Benson: Excuse me! Are you listening to me? Hello!?

(The worker turns around to Benson)

Benson: I'm looking for two guys who came through here. A tall one and a short one.

Cashier: Sure. Those guys come here every day.

(She points towards two people who aren't Mordecai and Rigby, who have a horse with them. One is a tall basketball player with a high-pitched voice, the other is a short jockey with a low-pitched voice)

Basketball Player: Oh, no! I bet he means those guys with the TV!

Jockey: We saw them headed toward the mall.

(Benson walks up to Skips)

Skips: You know, I have extra car batteries. I can just give you one.

(Benson passes Skips a hot dog)

Benson: No, Skips. This is between them and I...me and them? Which one is it?

Skips: Them and me. I'm going to a movie, have fun doing your thing.

(Back inside the mall)

Mordecai: Alright, dude. Three, two, one...

Mordecai & Rigby: Hologram wall! Wuwuwuwuwuwuh-

(Mordecai and Rigby run towards the wall, hitting it. They fall back to the ground, as Rigby's drink goes flying in the air and lands next to a caged secret passage. The drink drips into it)

Rigby: Well, that was my last idea. This is hopeless!

Mordecai: Wait, listen.

(They can hear the drink dripping to an underground base)

Mordecai: Do you hear that?

(They look over to the entrance)

Rigby: Do you think?

(They open up the entrance)

Mordecai: It's Maury Moto's secret passage!

(They both carefully enter the passage, while having to carry the TV down too. Rigby suddenly hears Benson)

Benson: Have you seen two guys with a TV?

Petition Guy: Sure. They were headed toward the food court. You wanna sign this petition to help fund stronger clipboards?

Benson: Of course!

(Benson grabs the guy's pen and goes to sign the petition, but the man's clipboard breaks immediately. Rigby gasps)

Rigby: Go, go, go, go, go!

(Benson signs the petition on the man's back, then walks off and glances towards the food court, where he can see the aftermath of the guys' earlier mishaps shoving through the tables. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby going down a ladder with the TV underneath the entrance to the passage. The ladder sounds unsteady however)

Mordecai: Dude, warn me if you're gonna rip one.

Rigby: I always warn you, those are the rules!

(The ladder suddenly snaps and the guys with the TV fall to the ground screaming. They survive the fall, and hear birds chipping from the other side of an underground tunnel)

Mordecai & Rigby: Huh?

(Mordecai and Rigby walk through the tunnel to see an abandoned underground mall)

Mordecai & Rigby: Whoa!

Mordecai: This mall must be like 15 years old.

Rigby: Man, it smells like a nuke cage in here.

Mordecai: You've been smelling a lot of stuff, lately.

Rigby:  Yeah, I just got over a cold so everything's really jumping out at me.

(Rigby stands on a booby trap  which causes a flying bladed disc to come hurling their way)

Mordecai: Run!

(Mordecai and Rigby run from the disc, they go up an escalator)

Mordecai: Up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

(The disc slices the bottom half of the escalator, causing the steps to drop to the ground. Luckily, Mordecai and Rigby make it in time. However, darts suddenly start flying out of the mouths of people on posters in the underground mall. The guys run and Rigby steps on another booby trap)

Mordecai: Dude! Stop stepping on booby traps!

(A giant axe swings from the ceiling towards Mordecai and Rigby. They quickly run into a video game store as the axe stops at the entrance, knocking the dudes slightly. Mordecai looks up to see the game store)

Mordecai: Oh, whoa! It's a game store.

Rigby: Yeah, except they only have lousy games left!

(Rigby picks up a game called "Lord Fury's Countdown Castle")

Rigby: Bleugh!

(Out of nowhere, the Eggscellent Knight pops up from behind the counter)

Eggscellent Knight: Weary travellers!

(Mordecai and Rigby gasp)

Eggscellent Knight: Thou seeketh the golden riches of Andor?

Mordecai: Uh, no? What are you doing here? I thought you were working at that other place?

Eggscellent Knight: The Eggscellent Diner is no more! There is much turnover in the relic guarding business. So what is it you seek, Mordecai of the Omelette?

Mordecai: Maury Moto's Golden Badge.

Eggscellent Knight: Ah, of course. If thou seeketh the golden game badge, you must travel the high road!

(The Eggscellent Knight points up, referring to a ladder which is behind him)

Rigby: Okay, cool.

Eggscellent Knight: But heed our policy! One must not be greedy. Only one relic per customer.

(Mordecai and Rigby head up the ladder)

Mordecai: Okay, got it.

Rigby: Thanks, man. Uh, so is that guy?

Eggscellent Knight: The fallen heroes of old await you, doomed adventurers!

(The camera tilts upwards through pipes, lava and a soda can with a rat. The camera follows the rat as it goes passed a sewer, which the camera then goes into, and follows out back to the ladder Mordecai and Rigby climbed down. The camera zooms up and out of the entrance to the secret passage, to show Benson taking a sample of the drink Rigby spilled and tasting it)

Benson: Still cold. Just like my online dating profile.

(Benson opens the trap door, as we go back to Mordecai and Rigby moving through the higher part of the mall. They see two skeletons posed in the same way as the video game characters Tim and Mark, laid against the wall indicating the entrance to Maury's lair)

Mordecai & Rigby: They were real...

(Suddenly, they hear Benson falling)

Benson: Ow, darnit!

Mordecai: Dude, hurry! Benson's gonna catch us!

Rigby: I don't see anything. This door doesn't even have a handle! This door blows!

Mordecai: Maybe it's some kind of light bay?

(Mordecai waves his arm to try and activate a sensor, but a bunch of spiked sticks push through almost hitting him)

Mordecai: Agh! Okay, maybe not.

(Rigby pulls some moss off the wall, which reveals a cartridge slot)

Rigby: Mordecai, look!

Mordecai: It's a cartridge slot.

Rigby: But that means we'd have to shut off the game!

(Mordecai grabs the joystick and pulls it again, bringing 8-bit Maury Moto back to the screen)

Maury: My guidance ends here. Your instincts have served you thus far. Trust in them, and your destiny awaits.

(Maury goes through a door, and the credits roll)

Mordecai: Hmph.

(Mordecai ejects the cartridge from the console, and the two bros put it into the cartridge slot. But nothing happens)

Mordecai: Okay, wait.

(Mordecai takes the cartridge out of the slot and starts blowing on it, and Rigby starts to blow into the cartridge slot. Once they're done, Mordecai inserts the cartridge once again, this time forming a light from the door. We see Mordecai and Rigby walking through a hallway, when they suddenly gasp. They see shelves stacked with games, as well as consoles and a variety of chips and sodas. It's an underground gaming paradise)

Rigby: I have never seen a place as cool as this.

Mordecai: Dude, look!

(Mordecai points to a skeleton sat on a sofa by a basket of golden game badges)

Mordecai: It's him. Maury Moto...

(Mordecai and Rigby walk up to Maury Moto's skeleton)

Rigby: I think we should say something.

(Mordecai clears his throat)

Mordecai: Maury Moto...your games...then that part when you jump up?

Rigby: Invisible block? Power-up comes out?

Mordecai: Like, my world was changed. Thanks, man.

Rigby: Thanks.

(Mordecai and Rigby both grab a golden game badge each, but realize they can't stick it onto their bodies)

Rigby: Oh, huh.

(They take off Maury Moto's jacket, and another skeleton's jacket too, to put the badges onto. They put their sunglasses on Maury)

Mordecai: Nice.

(Suddenly, the whole lair starts to shake up)

Mordecai: What? No! 

Rigby: But we only took one per customer!

(It's revealed that the shaking was caused by Benson, who has just punched through the wall easily)

Benson: Really gotta re-insulate that. You two! I can't believe you stole my car battery for a couple stupid fabric patches!

Mordecai: Uh, first off - these are badges.

Rigby: Yeah - rare golden game badges! They're like priceless!

Benson: Oh, well if they're so valuable, I guess I could just buy a new battery with -

(Benson goes to take the whole basket of badges)

Mordecai & Rigby: No!

(As Benson picks up the basket, it reveals a stringed attachment, which causes the whole place to start collapsing)

Mordecai: What do we do?

Rigby: I don't know!

(Light can be seen through a gap in the wall, which suddenly breaks into a huge hole)

Mordecai: Into the light!

(The trio run towards the hole as the place comes crumbling down. They land back in the mall food court.

(Mordecai turns around and sees the hole they just caused start to reseal itself. The Eggscellent Knight walks to the hole and waves. Later, the Sun is seen setting while the guys are back at Skips' van by the sea. Mordecai, Rigby and Benson have blankets around them)

Benson: This has been the longest day of my life. First, the sprinklers were too short and the next thing I know, I'm climbing into some abandoned mall. And then there was those gibbons.

(Benson giggles to himself)

Benson: I had to talk to some crazy old knight, and punched through a wall and - man, that was really something.

Mordecai: Dude, if you wanted to hang out with us so bad, you could've just asked.

(Benson blushes)

Benson: Give me those stupid patches!

(Benson rips the badges off Mordecai and Rigby's jackets. Meanwhile, Skips is in the driver's seat looking out to the sky)

Mordecai: Aw, come on!

Skips: Holy...hey, look!

(The gang see Maury Moto's lair flying away in the sky. Mordecai and Rigby look up in amazement, as a giant hologram of Maury Moto can be seen projected by the Sun)

Maury: Thank you, Mordecai and Rigby, for setting me free with your kind words.

Mordecai & Rigby: Awesome...

Maury: Now you've unlocked the map to find the Crystal Track Ball of Infinity.

(A bigger, even more complicated map is projected in the sky)

Mordecai & Rigby: What?

(Benson quickly grabs Mordecai and Rigby and pulls them into Skips' van)

Benson: Skips, drive away right now!

(Skips drives off)

Mordecai: Aw, man!

(End of Gamers Never Say Die)

(Episode starts with Benson walking out of the house, whistling, he approaches the garage, the door, which is open, is painted to look like the interior)

Benson: Ugh! How many times do I have to tell them? Close the garage door when you're finished painting it!

(he gets out the garage controller and shuts the door, he looks at his clipboard, he then looks up)

Benson: What the? Didn't I just close that? (he presses the button on the controller twice and stares at the interior-painted door) Argh!

(Pops is in Carmenita and driving towards the garage)

Pops: Coming through! (he laughs)

Benson: Pops! No! (he jumps out of the way, as Pops crashes into the garage, he then looks towards the door)

Pops: Bad Show!

Benson: MORDECAI AND RIGBY!!!

(a firetruck is now at the house, a fireman is using the Jaws of Life to get Pops out, he gets out)

Pops: Ugh!

Rigby: Pops, are you okay?

Pops: Optical Illusion!

Fireman: Don't worry, sir! Thanks to the jaws of life, you'll never get trapped in an enclosed space again. (he opens the jaws of life)

Mordecai & Rigby: Whoa!

Rigby: Where'd you get that?

Fireman: It came with the truck.

Benson: What were you two thinking?!

Rigby: It was just a joke!

Mordecai: Yeah, we were going to paint over it after our break!

Benson: Well, how's this for a joke? Buy a new garage door by the end of the day or you're fired!

(He leaves.)

Rigby: That's not a very funny joke!

Mordecai: Come on, let's go get the garage door.

Pops: Well I'm coming with you, it's my fault you have to replace the garage door in the first place.

Mordecai: Thanks Pops.

Rigby: That new place "House Warehouse" just opened up. They have everything.

(cut to the House Warehouse, suspense music is playing)

(everybody enters with a long gasp)

Rigby: Ugh! This is gonna take forever! Hey, it's that old knight guy!

Eggscellent Knight: Ah! Good-morrow, valued customers!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops approach him.)

Mordecai: Dude, weren't you just guarding those Golden Game Badges?

Eggscellent Knight: The game store floated away. And with it, my job. But fortune smiles upon me as the home improvement business is booming!

Rigby: Oh. That's cool.

Eggscellent Knight: Now then. Uh...Might I interest thee in a rewards card?

Pops: Ooh! I love rewards!

Mordecai: No. We're not here for that. Can you just tell us where the garage doors are?

(The Knight gasps.)

Eggscelent Knight: Garage doors, you say?! Oh, that is not an easy item to acquire. For, you see, they're located in a faraway aisle deep within the heart of the House Warehouse.

(To be added)

(Episode begins at Skips' house. Mordecai and Rigby are cleaning out his garage while he's on the phone.)

Skips: Sorry Gary, I can't. I'm cleaning out my garage today.

(Gary and the Guardians of Eternal Youth are traveling the galaxy in Gary's El Camino)

Gary: But we haven't had a guy's night out in ages and we're passing right through your galaxy. 

Skips: I told you, I can't go!

(Mordecai grabs a hat rack and notices something)

Mordecai: Whoa! Rigby get over here. 

Rigby: Let me guess a mortal junk... Whoa. 

(They are looking at a synthesizer) 

Mordecai: Dude, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen. 

Rigby: (walks up to it, mesmerized) So cool. 

Mordecai: No, dude! Look! 

(Mordecai points to the sign that says "Do not touch"). 

Rigby: (scoffs) How many times does touching stuff we're not supposed to caused a problem?

Mordecai: Like every time, dude. 

Rigby: Well, maybe this time nothing will happen. Watch. 

(Rigby cranks up the volume) 

Mordecai and Rigby: Cool. 

(Rigby pulls out a plug, which causes a small surge as the synthesizer vibrates) 

Rigby: Nice. Hmm. (puts the plug in a different outlet) 

Mordecai: Yes yes yes!

(they both giggle as they start mixing the plugs around until Skips enters the garage)

Skips: What are you doing!? That's Gary's synthesizer! (A crash is heard. The three of them look outside to find the Guardians of Eternal Youth dazed as they exit Gary's El Camino, which crashed into a tree) Are you guys okay? (Mordecai, Rigby and Skips head over to them) 

Reginald: We're fine.

Skips: Where's Gary? 

Reginald: Well, (flashback to when they were traveling) we were on our way to the galactic mall... 

Gary: Come on, Skips. 

Oswald: ...when Gary straight up disappeared.

(Gary disappears, causing the Guardians to gasp)

Boswold: (grabbing the steering wheel) I don't know how to drive stick. (they all scream as the car swerves) 

Reginald: Only one thing could've caused this. 

Boswold: Which one of you messed with his synthesizer?

(Skips glares at Mordecai and Rigby)

Rigby: Uh, messed with? 

Mordecai: I mean, we might've unplugged some cables. 

Reginald: Fools! That device synthesizes Gary's physical being into existence. 

Skips: (worried) So, Gary's dead? 

Reginald: No! His conscious still resides within the snyth. But, until you put the cables back to make the correct patch, the device won't project his physical form. 

Rigby: It's cool. We'll just put it back the way it was. How hard can it be?

(Everyone is gathered at Gary's synthesizer)

Mordecai: Skips? 

Skips: Oh, no no. Can't help you here. Just plug back the cables you unplugged. 

Mordecai: (nervously) Right. 

Rigby: (nervously) Piece of cake.

(The two of them plug the cables into random spots)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm!

(Rigby presses a key, which causes the synthesizer to emit a loud high frequency sound. This culminates in Skips' windows and his glass harmonica shattering)

Skips: My priceless glass harmonica!

(Skips and the Eternal Youth Guardians glare at Mordecai and Rigby)

Rigby: Any sign of Gary? No?

Mordecai: Why would Gary leave such an important thing in Skips' garage?

Reginald: That's it! You must travel to Gary's home world of Synthos to recreate the synth patch to bring him back!

Mordecai and Rigby: Wait, what? (Reginald snaps his fingers, transporting Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, and Gary's synthesizer to Synthos) Aah!

(The scene cuts to Synthos, with the three of them and the synthesizer, which Mordecai and Rigby are carrying, arriving)

Mordecai and Rigby: (amazed by the view) Whoa.

(David and two of his guards appear)

David: Welcome, new arrivals, to Synth City. I'm David, King and Ruler of Synthos.

Rigby: 'Sup? I'm Rigby. I'm the King of Earth. (Mordecai hits him with the synthesizer) Oh! Ow.

David: Welcome, Earth ambassadors. I trust you can... (looks at Skips and gasps) oh! Hey! (points to Skips, then himself) Bare chest, bare chest. Twins. (David poses as one of his guards takes a photo of him and Skips) That one's going in the album. Will you be with us for long?

Mordecai: No, we unplugged a patch on this thing and we just need help re-synthesizing our friend.

David: Hm, shame. Well, seeing as you are the newest alien ambassadors we have, you may consider yourselves my honored guests. Let's head back to my office and see if we can get you sorted out. (They all start traveling to David's office, checking out the city along the way) As you can see, we have a society in which all our synthizens play music in perfect harmony. (everyone plays their synthesizers harmoniously, pleasing David) Mm, not a note out of place. (They pass by two synthizens, Robert and Keith. Robert rides his synthesizer like a skateboard, creating a discordant tone. David gasps and plays an ominous tune on his synthesizer belt, summoning an event security robot.)

Security Bot: Discord detected.

Keith: (outraged) Discord is cool! (the security bot captures him and Robert) Discord is the lifeblood of modern music!

Mordecai: (confused) What was that all about?

David: He ended his song on an unresolved seventh. It's impossible to make that into a harmonious sound. I'm sorry you had to hear that. (Mordecai and Rigby try to set Gary's synthesizer down, only for David to keep walking) Let us continue to the palace.

(Rigby and Mordecai groan as they continue to carry the synthesizer)

Rigby: Skips, this is getting really heavy. Could you just carry it for a little while?

Skips: (sternly) Did I kill Gary?

Mordecai and Rigby: (reluctantly) No.

Skips: Then, there's your answer.

(Everyone arrives at the Synthos Palace, walking down a long hallway with holographic heads on display)

David: This is Harmon Hall. The portraits faces of all our previous heads of state ranging from: Moginious Vangeloworth to Lady Tronroeder, all the way up to...(walks past the one that mysteriously says "Out of Order") to myself, of course. What do you guys think?

(Mordecai, Rigby and Skips compliment the hologram at once)

Mordecai: Can you just take us to your office, so we can re-synthesize our friend?

David: (smiles) A man of business. Let's get to it. (David's office) So, you need to reload your friend's patch? (turns around as the office shows a giant synthesizer keyboard as a floor) Well, you boys seem to have a bit of a problem, don't you?

Mordecai: Yeah, and we're really sorry, but could we please set this down somewhere?

David: (chuckles) I know you're new here, but I'm afraid setting that on the floor would create a discordant tone.

Rigby: Ugh! Stupid really cool floor.

David: (pulls out a holographic web page) Do you know anything about his patch combination? His base waveform?

Skips: (shows David a photo) Well, here's a picture of him.

David: (sees the picture, which was taken from "Skips Strikes") Hmm. Ah, yes. Yes, I do remember him. His name is Gareth, correct? We must get to the re-synthesizing studio at once. (leads them to a "studio") And, right through here is the re-synthesizing studio.

(everyone sees the two arrested synthizens from before)

Mordecai: Hey, what are those guys doing here?

(David plays the same tune from earlier, sealing the door, to Mordecai and Rigby's confusion)

David: I'm sorry, but I simply can't let you re-synthesize Gary. He's the most wanted criminal in all of Synthos.

Mordecai, Rigby and Skips: (shocked) What?

David: (angry) His experimental jam sessions nearly destroyed this world. And your association with him makes YOU all criminals as well!

Skips: What's gonna happen to us?

David: Oh, the same thing we do with all discordants. You'll be shot into our sun, The Synth Star. (the hatch opens to show the sun) Ciao, then.

Mordecai: Hey! Hey, let us out!

(the rocket reaches ground level, as the synthezens protest to this)

Robert: Let's tune out for our execution.

Keith: Yes, quite.

(the rocket prepares to launch)

Automated Voice: 10 seconds to launch.

(Skips, Mordecai and Rigby try to break free)

Keith: Don't bother! There's no way you're punching through that futuristic material.

Robert: I believe you talents call it "tempered glass".

Skips: (remembers something) Glass? Guys! Your patch from the garage!

Automated Voice: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...

(Mordecai and Rigby re-plug the cables the same way they did from before. Rigby then plays some keys as Mordecai and Skips cover their ears)

Keith: Mmm. Dig that crazy sound.

(the sound shatters the rocket's glass. Gary's hologram emerges from the synthesizer)

Gary: (angrily, with a distorted voice) YOU GUYS!

(the Synthizens gasp and recognize Gary's face as everyone lands back on the ground, with Skips holding onto Gary's synthesizer)

Keith: That's Gareth's synthesizer.

Rigby: Yeah, you guys know him?

Keith: He's the rightful King of Synthos.

Skips: What? He's not a criminal?

Robert: No. (Robert and Keith project a holographic screen from their eyes, featuring David, a security bot, and Gareth with his synthesizer) After Gareth's disappearance 200 years ago, David seized the throne. Before long, he completely outlawed anything challenging. We've long awaited the return of Gareth and his forward thinking taste in music. 

Mordecai: (gasps) The patch! That's exactly what we need.

David: Now that you know the truth, I won't let you re-synthesize Gareth. (plays the ominous tune, activating the security bots next to him)

Skips: You guys work on Gary's patch. (skips to the robots)

Mordecai: Guys, we need to copy the hologram. (Robert and Keith nod, as they lower the hologram to their level. Mordecai Rigby look at each other as they proceed to fix the patch)

(Skips jumps onto one of the bots and proceeds to destroy it. Mordecai fixes one of the cables, Rigby hits a key. Gary's physical form appears distorted)

Mordecai: We almost got him.

Robert: Try the ring modulator.

Mordecai: The what?

Robert: The round one, with the knobby thing on it.

(Mordecai turns the dial Robert specified, nearly straightening Gary's body. Skips has destroyed the robots, prompting David to fire a stun laser at him)

David: Jam session's over, boys.

Mordecai: Skips! (notices a loose cable) Rigby, the low-pass filter.

(Rigby adjusts that cable, restoring Gary's patch)

David: (gasps) No!

(Gary reappears; the synthizens mutter in excitement)

Keith: It's him. It's really him.

Robert: I'm so excited, I can barely contain myself.

Gary: Hello, David. My half-brother.

(everyone gasps)

David: Oh, hello Gareth. So good to see you again.

Gary: Don't play coy with me. I heard everything, David. And, it's not cool.

Mordecai: Dude, are you really the King of Synthos?

Gary: I'm back. So, it appears as though I am. Synthizens of Synthos, I formally challenge David's right to the throne.

David: You'll rue this day, Gareth.

(nearby synthizens play their synthesizers as David project a holographic keyboard from his belt and Gary summons his synthesizer to him)

(David begins to play a harmonious sound on his synthesizer, shocking Mordecai and Rigby. Gary starts to play his own tune in response. David turns his flat keyboard into a round one, playing a more complex tune that levitates himself off the ground. Gary proceeds to do the same with a discordant tone)

Everyone: (chanting) Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!

David: (gasps as Gary plays a harmony through discord) Discord! It's impossible!

Gary: Nothing's impossible... through music!

(Gary's final notes create a blast that hits David, sending him onto the rocket)

Automated Voice: Launch resumed.

(The rocket is launched)

David: (weakly) Thank... you.

(The rocket makes impact with the Synth Star. The Synth Star destroys the rocket and David's body. David's synthesizer belt lands back on the planet floor)

Rigby: Did you just kill your half-brother?

Gary: I merely destroyed his physical form

Robert: Don't worry. We've got this. (he and Keith pull out baseball bats and destroy David's belt)

Mordecai: Dude, that's dark.

Skips: It is the way of Synthos.

Synthizen: Why did you leave us, Gareth?

Gary: I hid my synthesizer in Skips' garage to encourage myself to travel the galaxy, before returning as your king. But, if there's one thing I've learned in my travels, it's that you can't rock with rules. I may be your king, but I am not your ruler. Form this day forth, there shall be no ruler of Synthos. Let music guide you for the rest of your days.

Synthizens: True. (I agree.) [He'll always be king of my heart.] (Wow.)

Mordecai: Sorry we changed your patch, Gary.

Rigby: Yeah. Won't happen again, probably.

Gary: We rock stars have no need for apologies. Now, let's blow this thing. Wings are on me. (snaps his fingers, summoning his car and the Guardians of Eternal Youth)

Reginald: Finally! Now, can we please go to the mall?

(Episode opens at Wing Kingdom)

Benson: Guys, guys! I'd like to propose a toast. I know I'm the one being honored tomorrow with the gold watch for showing up to work 1,000 consecutive days in a row, but I want you to know: it's actually about you guys, (Claps) so thank you.

(Muscle Man, Fives, Thomas, Pops and Skips applaud.)

Skips: Thanks, Benson. That means a lot.

Thomas: How do you do it? How do you always get to work on time?

Benson: That is a great question, Thomas. Did everybody hear that? (Gestures to his forehead) The guy knows how to think. I've gotten this far in life by doing one thing, and that's playing it safe. I set three alarm clocks every night, including (Points to his watch) this one. And then, I leave my toast and coffee out the night before so that it's ready for me when I wake up.

Muscle Man: You eat stale toast?

Benson: Yes. And I don't like it, not one bit. But I know that it'll all be worth it the moment that Mr. Maellard honors me with that gold watch.

Hi Five Ghost: You must want that watch pretty bad, huh?

Benson: Oh, you have no idea how long I've wanted that thing! But tonight, I can finally stand before you guys and say: "I did it!"

(They all cheer)

Muscle Man: Hey, man, I don't mean to be a Debbie H. Downer here, but don't you think it's a little bit early to be celebrating? I mean, you still have to make it on time tomorrow.

Benson: Oh, come on, Muscle Man. What could possibly go wrong between now and then?

(Mordecai and Rigby show up with two guys)

Mordecai: Hey, Benson. You're not gonna believe thisthese guys are celebrating 1,000 of something, too!

Tango: 1,000 test missions.

Benson: You guys are test pilots?

Stache: We sure are.

Tango: Hey, I'm Tango and this is Stache.

Benson: Wait, you're not Stache?

Tango: No, I'm Tango. (Gestures to the other man) He's Stache.

Stache: Why don't you join us for some wings, and we'll celebrate our 1000s together?

Benson: More wings? Benson likey, and I'm Benson!

Skips: I'm not sure more wings is a good idea, Benson. You don't wanna eat yourself into a food coma again.

Pops: Yes. Perhaps you've done enough winging for one night.

Benson: Look, I can handle it, guys. It's just one round.

Skips: It's just, uh... well, sometimes people do things they regret on a bellyful of wings.

Pops: That's all we're saying.

Benson: Don't worry, guys. I got it under control.

(Cut to black. An alarm sound is heard, then it fades to the next day in a desert as Benson wakes up and checks his watch. The time is shown to be six a.m.)

Benson: Ow... my head.

(He's seen stranded in the desert with a military jumpsuit strapped to an ejector's seat with a parachute behind it) 

Benson (continued): What happened to me?

Benson: (Voice-over) What could possibly go wrong between now and then?

Mordecai: (Voice-over) Hey, Benson. You're not gonna believe thisthese guys are celebrating 1,000 of something, too!

Benson (continued): URRRRGH, MORDECAI AND RIGBY!!!!

(A clock transition to Benson's feet as he runs through the desert, then cut to Benson running through the desert) 

Benson (continued): Where am I?

(Checks his watch)

Benson (continued): Augh! I only have three hours to get back. How am I ever...

(He sees a road with a telephone booth on the other side of the desert) 

Benson (continued): Wait, a road. I'm saved!

(He runs up to the phone booth, puts his quarter in, and dials a number)

Benson (continued): Come on, come on, pick up.

Pops: (On the phone) Hello?

Benson: Pops, it's Benson.

Pops: Oh, Benson; are you okay?

Benson: I'm fine, Pops. Listen, could you put Mordecai and Rigby on so I can scream at them for ruining my life?

Pops: They're not with you? Oh, dear, they didn't come home last night. We're all worried sick!

Benson: What the heck happened last night?

Pops: I'm afraid I don't know.

Benson: (Sighs) Well, whatever it was left me stranded out in the desert. Could you come pick me up?

Pops: Oh, of course. Where in the desert are you exactly?

Benson: Uh, hold on, let me see. (He looks around the desert) Great.

(He sees a police car coming)

Benson (continued): Oh, a car.

(A sheriff is seen driving the police car) 

Benson (continued): Hey! Hey, stop!

(The sheriff stops driving and exits his car. The camera then proceeds to pan up to his face. The sheriff sniffs.) 

Benson (continued): Can you tell me what road this is?

Sheriff: Sure. How about right after you tell me if this hurts or not?

(He punches Benson, proceeds to arrest him, and drives away)

Pops: (On the phone) Benson? Hello?

(Cut to the sheriff's office next to a prison cell, which has Mordecai, Rigby, Tango, and Stache in it.)

Benson: What on earth are you arresting me for?

Mordecai: Benson, you're alright!

Benson: You!

Sheriff: (Puts Benson behind the prison bars) Ha! Knock yourselves out.

(The sheriff closes the door as Benson grabs Mordecai by the neck)

Benson: What did you do to me?!

Mordecai: (Choking) Do you not.... remember anything?

Benson: No!

Mordecai: Get off of me and I'll tell you!

(Benson lets go of him as he takes a deep breath) 

Mordecai (continued): Here's what happened.

(A flashback begins of the night before at Wing Kingdom) 

Mordecai (continued): The wings just kept coming.

(The guys repeatedly shout "Benson!" as Benson pours a cup of wings into his mouth)

Guys: Whooooooo!!!!

(Fade)

Stache: Both of our engines were on fire, but somehow we managed to crash-land right in the middle of a hot-tub party.

Benson: I wish I was cool like you guys. Instead, I'm being honored tomorrow for 'playing it safe.'

Rigby: Ouch.

Stache: Yeah, that's rough.

Tango: If you want to be honored tomorrow with some Grade-A-Guts, you should drive up to the ceremony in the Mach Infinity.

Stache: Yeah, it's the supersonic car we just test-drove.

Benson: Seriously?

Mordecai: I didn't know that car actually existed!

Rigby: Nothing can drive that fast.

(Benson chuckles deeply)

Stache: You'd be taking a big risk, but in a cool way.

Rigby: I don't know, Benson.

Mordecai: You might be risking more than just that gold watch.

Benson: (Pounds on the table) It's worth it!

(Cut to the guys outside. Benson is patiently awaiting their instructions in the Mach Infinity.)

Stache: Just make sure your lift-to-drag ratio stays level. You don't wanna go into a high-G maneuvor.

Rigby: Whooooo! High-G maneuvor!

Benson: Alright, here goes. (Sets car to Drive)

(Benson starts speeding straight ahead and screams as he goes over the limit)

Benson: Stop! Stop! Stop!

(Fearing for his life, he yanks a cord and ejects out of the seat, landing out far in the desert. He passes out as the seat comes to a halt. A parachute pops out.)

(Flashback ends)

Benson: That's crazy.

Tango: Yeah. You landed about a mile away, but the car kept going and ended up on the road.

Mordecai: Yeah, when we went to go find you, the cop arrested us for speeding.

Stache: We even showed him our government clearance card which allows us to speed. But he just ripped it up.

Rigby: He was like, "nyah, nyah"....

(Makes tearing motions with his hands)

Benson: I'll go try and talk to this guy.

(Walks up)

Benson (continued): Uh, hi sir? I kind of have to be somewhere by nine and...

Sheriff: Well, we wouldn't want you to be late, now would we?

Benson: No we wouldn't, sir.

Sheriff: Well, son, the soonest I can open that door for you is, uh... 9:01 A.M.

(Benson bangs his head on the prison bars)

Mordecai: You didn't even look at anything! You just made that time up to be a jerk!

Sheriff: (Points) You open your mouth again, pretty boy, and you're getting the hose!

Pops: (Offscreen) That won't be necessary!

All: Pops!

Benson: How did you find us?

Pops: Oh, it was quite simple.

(A flashback begins to earlier where the sheriff arrests Benson, and a chicken vulture is on top of the police car.)

Pops (continued): While you we're being arrested, I happened to hear the distinct mating call of a chubby-necked chicken in the background.

(Cut to Pops using the computer to look for information about the chubby-necked chicken vulture)

Pops (continued): I tried to use your computing device to look up its habitat on the internet.

(It shows a shirtless man with orange hair and muscles, then Pops covered his eyes, and ran away)

Pops (continued): But, I got scared.

(Cut to Thomas looking for information about the chubby-necked chicken vulture, while Pops is standing up, looking scared)

Pops (continued): So, I called Thomas over, and he found it without any trouble at all.

(Flashback ends)

Benson: Wow, Pops, that's amazing.

Pops: Now, Officer, allow me to pay you whatever finds they re-crude, and we'll be on our merry way.

Sheriff: Are you trying to bribe me, sir?

Pops: Bribe?

(The sheriff throws Pops in behind the prison bars)

All: Pops!

Mordecai: You can't arrest him for no reason!

Rigby: Yeah, you think you're above the law?!

Sheriff: On this quarter mile stretcher highway, I am the law!

(The sheriff picks up a hose and sprays on them, and then closes the prison door)

Sheriff (continued): Y'all sit tight while I find the bigger hose.

(The sheriff leaves to get the bigger hose)

Benson: (Sighs) Well, you ruined my life again.

Rigby: What?! We have nothing to do with this!

Benson: I woke up in a military jumpsuit, strapped to an ejector's seat. Of course you have something to do with this!

Stache: Woah, Benson.

Tango: Nobody put those wings inside you but you.

Stache: Just because we party like handsome maniacs doesn't mean you didn't have a choice.

Benson: (sighs) You're right. I decided to take risks and this is the price I pay. We've tried everything but this cop won't listen to reason.

Tango: Maybe you can't reason your way out of this one.

Stache: Maybe the solution is...

Benson: ...another risk. Ok, I got an idea.

(The cop  comes in with the bigger hose, whistling. He sees only Pops, who is groaning on the ground, and drops the hose.)

Sheriff: What in tarnation happened here?!

(Pops slowly gets up.)

Pops: Oh, it was terrible!

(We see the others hiding and clinging onto Pops head.)

Pops (continued): They ganged up on me and beat me up before they escaped!

Sheriff: Escaped?! (unlocks the cell) Nobody escapes from my-

Pops: Now!

(Everyone appears.)

Sheriff: What?!

(Benson and the guys tackle the sheriff. They are seen running out through the door.)

Mordecai: I can't believe that worked!

Rigby: Yeah. I figured Pops' head would only hide two of three of us tops.

Mordecai: How much time until the ceremony?

(Benson checks his watch.)

Benson: Less than an hour.

Pops: (pointing) We can take Carmenita.

Benson: She's too slow!

(Tango clears his throat and shows Benson the keys to the Mach Infinity.)

Stache: It's your only chance, Benson.

Tango: How bad do you want that watch?

(Benson puts his hand out.)

Benson: More than anything.

(The others go into Carmenita.)

Tango: Perfect! Let's go!

(Tango throws the keys to Benson. Carmenita takes off.)

Rigby: See you at the ceremony!

(Benson looks over to the Mach Infinity. Cut back to the sheriff in the cell, getting up)

Sheriff: What?!

(He moves to the seat, slamming it, and reveals a compartment with guns, nunchucks, a grenade and other items. He takes the big gun and shoots the cell door open. Meanwhile Benson is trying to start the Infinity. He holds down on a button.)

Benson: Come on, come on.....yes!

(The sheriff runs up to him.)

Sheriff: Get out of the car!

(As Benson, drives away, the rudder slices off the sheriff's mustache in slow-motion, then the sheriff is knocked down to the ground. Benson escapes through the gate in the Infinity through the desert)

Sheriff: It took me thirty years to grow this thing!

(He gets up and starts running. On the road, he is in the police car, shooting his gun out. He tries to hit the Infinity.)

Benson: What the-?!

(He thrusts the Infinity forward. It speeds up, heading for 700 kph.)

Sheriff: Where're you goin', boy?!

(He pushes a button, and his car's engine powers up some more. While the Infinity is still speeding up, the police car's engine starts catching on fire. The front opens up.)

Sheriff (continued): Noooooooo!

(He and the car get obliterated. Benson continues to speed in the Infinity as the scene changes to rainy weather. A wing floats in front of Benson. The Infinity finally stops in the Park. The time on Benson's watch is 8:59.)

Benson: Yes! I made it.

(Benson walks up to the park groundskeepers, Tango, Stache and Mr. Maellard, who are wearing suit and holding umbrellas. Standing with them are some men.)

Benson (continued): Hey, how did you guys get here before me?

(The park members gasp.)

Pops: It's a miracle!

Benson: Well, I don't know about miracle, but...

Mordecai: Dude, where have you been for the last 3 months?

Benson: What?

Tango: What probably happened is that you went so fast, that you actually travelled three months into the future.

Rigby: We all thought you were dead, man!

Benson: Then if this isn't my gold watch ceremony, it's my...

(We are shown a gravestone that says 'Benson "You're Fired"'.)

Skips: Memorial service.

Benson: And who are all of these guys?

Skips: They're applicants for the park manger position. They're waiting until after the service to be interviewed.

(Benson goes up to his boss.)

Benson: Mr. Maellard, about the gold watch...

Mr. Maellard: Uh, I'm gonna have to say no. I've always been a stickler for the rules.

Rigby: Hey, man. At least you're not dead.

Benson: No!

(He runs back to the Infinity.)

Benson (continued): Without that watch, I am dead.

(He turns on the Infinity, and puts it in reverse before looking behind. Tango and Stache run after him.)

Tango and Stache: Benson, stop!

Stache: The Infinity's reverse gear could tear a hole in space time!

Benson: I have to take that chance!

(With that, the Infinity zips off.)

Stache: Now, there goes a man who takes risks.

(The Infinity is reversing down the road.)

Benson: Come on!

(A screw loosens out, and the glass begins to crack. As it zips out on the ocean, Benson's face appears distorted in slow motion. The Infinity begins to enter space time.)

Benson (continued): (whispering) I...I never knew.

(Benson screams as the Infinity reverses around the Earth. He looks at his watch as its reversing in time.)

Benson (continued): It's..... working!

(He accidentally dismantles the stick shift, and there is a bright spark. Parts of the Infinity begin to break off, and Benson pulls the parachute and screams as he exits space time and stops in front of the ceremony.)

Muscle Man: Told you he'd make it.

(The boss walks up to Benson with a small red box.)

Mr. Maellard: 9:00 A.M. on the dot! You did it, my boy.

(He reveals the gold watch, shining brightly.)

Benson: (sighs) It's beautiful.

Muscle Man: I brought us some wings to help us celebrate.

Benson: (chuckles) Sorry, Muscle Man, not this time.

Mr. Maellard: Come on, it's only one wing.

Benson: Well....

(Cut to black. We fade to Benson.)

Benson (continued): Oh, my head. Where...

(We zoom out to see him out in the middle of the ocean.)

Benson (continued): Ah, come on!

(End of Gold Watch)

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby fighting with Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost about the computer sign-up sheet)

Mordecai: Dude! Get off the computer, Muscle Man! Read the sign-up sheet! We're signed up for 1:30!

Muscle Man: Hey, chill out, you jerks! We still have 5 minutes. (pushes Mordecai & Rigby away) Go wait in the lounge.

Rigby: Fine! 5 minutes!

(Mordecai and Rigby sit on chairs in the Computer Waiting Lounge)

Muscle Man: Aw, yeah! More internet videos!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost play the Old Man Horseshoes video. In the video, an old man is playing horseshoes, but gets struck by lightning and turns into a pile of ashes)

Muscle Man: (laughs) Old Man Horseshoes, you're pathetic! (Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost laugh)

Rigby: I saw that one coming.

Hi Five Ghost: Oh, dude! Road Hog!

Muscle Man: Oh yeah! That's a good one!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost play the Road Hog video. In the video, Road Hog attempts to drive his car across a canyon, but he fails and crashes into the other edge of the canyon. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost laugh)

Muscle Man: (notices Mordecai and Rigby grimacing at him) This is some hilarious stuff, losers! It's got a setup, a punchline, a dude gets hurt! Come on!

Mordecai: Still not funny.

Muscle Man: Get over here!

(Mordecai and Rigby move their chairs over to the computer)

Muscle Man: (typing) You guys are gonna thank me for this.

(A video plays where a guy is drinking soda. Wedgie Ninja sneaks behind him and gives him a wedgie. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost laugh)

Mordecai: I-(interrupted by Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Uh uh uh! Wait for it...

(Scene goes back to video)

Guy: Why, Wedgie Ninja?

(All of a sudden, a bear falls on the guy and plays the glockenspiel. Then he farts on the guy)

Guy: Oh, my back!

(Scene changes back to computer room, where Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are seen laughing)

Muscle Man: (laughs) He just farted on that guy's back!

Mordecai: (to a laughing Rigby) Why are you laughing, dude?

Rigby: That dude did get hurt! Plus the bear farted on his back!

Mordecai: Dude! Muscle Man, Wedgie Ninja? Glocken Bear? This viral video stuff is stupid.

Muscle Man: What? Bro, if it's so stupid, why does it have so many hits?

Mordecai: Me and Rigby could come up with a video that gets way more hits than that.

Rigby: Yeah!

Muscle Man: In your dreams! Me and Fives could get way more hits than you dorks.

Mordecai: No you couldn't.

Muscle Man: Yes we could! Ten bucks says we can make a better video than yours by the end of the week.

Mordecai: You're on. (Him and Muscle Man shake hands)

Muscle Man, Mordecai, and Rigby: Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm!

(Begins a montage set to the song "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" by Pat Benatar.  The montage consists of Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost making viral videos. M and R's videos only get a small number of views, while MM and Hi Five Ghost's videos get a large amount of views. The montage ends and the scene goes to the computer room)

Muscle Man: Pay up, losers!

Mordecai: No way! The week's not even through yet!

Muscle Man: We're like a million views ahead of you! You might as well just give up!

Mordecai: No! We'll have an awesome internet video by the end of the day!

Muscle Man: How much are you going to bet on that?

Mordecai: Double or nothing!

Muscle Man: Aw man! We're gonna be rich!

(The scene changes to outside Pops' House, where M&R are making a viral video)

Mordecai: Okay, best internet video ever! Take one.

Rigby: Wait, what do I do again?

Mordecai: Yeah, so, just start jumping, right? And get some major air. And I don't know, then like, do some awesome backflips or something.

Rigby: (starts jumping) Right. Are you getting this?

(Mordecai thumbs up)

Rigby: Wooo! Wooo! (Rigby starts jumping and kisses his muscles, and pretends to play guitar)

Mordecai: Hmm, still not going high enough. I know, let me try something.

(Mordecai walks onto the trampoline. Mordecai jumps when Rigby hits the trampoline, but Rigby flies to the tree and bangs his head on the branch)

Mordecai: (gasps) Rigby!

Rigby: Ugh!

Mordecai: Dude, are you okay?

Rigby: Dude... that was AWESOME!

Mordecai: That's called a double-jump!

Pops: Is this one of those new fangled movie cameras?

Mordecai: Oh, Pops, You don't wanna touch that, we're trying to make a movie.

Pops: *gasps* Does your movie have sound? Back in my day we used to call those talkies.

Mordecai: Ha'yeah, we're making a movie about jumping on the trampoline.

Pops: We used to call those jumpies. Can I be in your jumpy?

Rigby: Dude, Mordecai, if we put more weight on the trampoline, we could get more air, right?

Mordecai: Yea, ok, but...

(Rigby points to Pops who sees a nickel on the ground)

Pops: Oh, somebody's dropped a shilling!

(Reaches for it and his head lands on the ground with his body in the air and laughs)

Mordecai and Rigby: You wanna be in our movie, Pops?

(Cuts to the three jumping on the trampoline.)

Mordecai: Triple jump!

Pops: Whee! Oh ho ho!

Mordecai: Hmm. I guess that was pretty high. But it wasn't a million views high.

Rigby: What we need is more power.

Mordecai: Yeah. Dude! I know exactly how!

(Cuts to Pops standing on top of the cart, with Mordecai holding a rope, at the top of which is hoisted a refrigerator.)

Mordecai: OK, Pops, you're going to do a double-jump with that refrigerator.

Pops: I'm going to be on the interwebs! Ho ho ho!

Mordecai: Alright, on three. One, two, three!

Rigby: Jump!

(Pops jumps, and flies to the heavens, laughing.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is gold!

Rigby: Wait til Muscle Man sees this!

(Pops screams and laughs, still flying upwards.)

Mordecai: Dude, look how high he's goin'!

(Pops disappears through a loophole in the sky.)

Rigby: Dude, where'd he go?

Mordecai: Don't worry, he'll fall down any second.

Rigby: Dude, he's not comin' down!

Mordecai: Oh, no. Oh no! Dude, we've gotta go get him!

Rigby: What? But we've still got to take care of the viral video.

Mordecai: Dude, he could be dead. I'm going after him and you're coming with me.

(Cuts to Mordecai and Rigby on top of the golf cart, with Mordecai again holding the refrigerator rope. Rigby has the camera.)

Mordecai: Ready?

Rigby: Just a sec. Might as well have a follow-up video.

Mordecai: OK. One, two, three!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump, and fly to the heavens, screaming, disappearing into the loophole. Cuts to Mordecai and Rigby in what looks to be the inside of a computer. Various viral videos are shown on screens.)

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: Woah. This footage is gold! We'll definitely beat Muscle Man with this.

Mordecai: Priorities, dude. First we get Pops. Wherever he is.

Rigby: What is this place?

Mordecai: Kinda looks like an insane asylum.

Rigby: Hey, look: it's Wedgie Ninja!

(A screen of Wedgie Ninja is showing.)

Wedgie Ninja: Help me.

Mordecai: What?

Warden of the Internet: What's your name?

Pops: Pops.

Rigby: It's Pops!

Warden of the Internet: Step over to your right, Pops.

Pops: Is this my passport photo for the interwebs?

Warden of the Internet: Sort of.

Pops: Ooh, I love photos. I am ready, madame.

Warden of the Internet: Say 'doomed for eternity.'

Pops: Doomed for eternity! Oh!

Rigby: No!

(Screen of Pops endlessly bouncing on a trampoline shows.)

Mordecai: Who are you and what did you do to Pops?

Warden of the Internet: My job. I'm the warden of the internet. Pops made the mistake of trying to make a viral video.

Mordecai: So?

Warden of the Internet: The internet should be a serious place used for writing research papers and maybe for keeping in touch with relatives once in a while. These silly viral videos are a disease. They must be contained.

Mordecai: Dude, that's not fair.

Rigby: Yeah, we're just trying to make entertaining videos.

Warden of the Internet: Wrong! All these people need to be punished, forced to live their stupidity on repeat forever.

Rigby: You're insane.

Mordecai: It's not even Pops' fault. He was just doing us a favor. Isn't that right, Pops?

Pops: I don't like the interwebs, Mordecai and Rigby!

Warden of the Internet: Wait a minute. Mordecai and Rigby? You're supposed to be in Pops' video. Now I have to reconfigure the laser video transporter for two more criminals that will spend eternity in endless loop for their interweb crimes.

(The screens all pause and the people within ask what's going on.)

Mordecai: Dude, get Pops.

(Rigby runs off screen.)

Mordecai: People of the internet: we're gonna get you out of here but we've gotta leave right now. Go into all the videos and get as many people as you can.

(The video screens all start to evacuate and shrink into the ground.)

Rigby: Pops, jump!

(Pops jumps from his screen into Rigby's arms, and Rigby backs into a red power button, turning the Warden's screen on.)

Warden of the Internet: Crimes! What? You!

Mordecai: Guys! Up here!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops escape through a screen. The Warden's screen breaks loose from its cables and chases.)

Rigby: Old man horseshoes!

Mordecai: Come on! Come on!

Warden of the Internet: You'll never get out of here alive!

(They find a car.)

Mordecai: Get in! Wait. Who's driving this?

Rigby: Roadhog!

(They scream as the car drives for the canyon.)

Mordecai: We're gonna die!

Pops: Look!

(A portal appears in the air. Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, and Old man horseshoes jump out of the car and through it. Mordecai is carrying Roadhog. They arrive back in the computer where the viral characters are waiting.)

Mordecai: Alright, everybody. To the portal - quick! Come on, come on! Now you, Pops!

(Pops makes to jump but the Warden grabs him by the ankle with her cables.)

Mordecai: No!

Warden of the Internet: Ha ha ha! Huh?!

Rigby: Wedgie Ninja!

(Wedgie Ninja is giving the Warden a wedgie.)

Wedgie Ninja: I don't know how much longer these panties are gonna hold!

Rigby: But-

Wedgie Ninja: Go, now! Guys... link to my video.

Rigby: We'll never forget you, Wedgie Ninja.

(The Warden's screen explodes as Mordecai, Rigby and Pops tumble into a portal. Cuts to the house. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are sitting on the front steps.)

Muscle Man: Where are those clowns? Probably skipped town because they know they won't win the bet.

(Viral characters tumble from the sky onto the trampoline. Mordecai, Pops, and Rigby land on top)

Muscle Man: What are you guys doin'?

Rigby: Mmmakin' viral videos!

Muscle Man: Huh?!

(Glockenbear falls from the sky, lands on Muscle Man, plays a brief jingle, then farts on Muscle Man's stomach. Camera pans out to a computer screen on WooHoo, where Mordecai and Rigby are watching this on video. Muscle Man is standing next to them.)

Mordecai: Ha ha ha! Oh, man, that's the best part. And two million views cannot deny.

Rigby: You know what else is the best part? Gettin' twenty dollars from this guy!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woaaaaah!

(Several viral characters join in with the woah. Pops laughs.)

Muscle Man: Don't you losers have somewhere to be?

(The episode ends)

(Episode begins with the park workers outside. Benson has an announcement)

Benson: All right, listen up. The cart needs a new suspension system, I don't know why that would be.

(Mordecai and Rigby look around)

Benson (continued): The old cemetery is falling apart and the house is in need of general repairs.

Muscle Man: What's wrong with the house?

(The stair he's sitting on breaks)

Benson: That's what wrong with the house. The problem is, we don't have the money to fix any of it. So does anyone have any ideas for how we can raise the money to cover these costs?

(Rigby raises his hand)

Benson (continued): Yes, Rigby?

Rigby: What's in it for us?

Benson: If you come up with something successful, you'll get a... (Zooms in closer to Benson's mouth for the next three words) ...paid day off.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Muscle Man: Hey, I got some choice sports equipment in the shed! Let's have a sports tournament, and get physic--

(The stair breaks apart, and he falls through)

Benson: Any other ideas?

Pops: A bake sale!

Benson: No.

Skips: A concert?

Benson: Mmm...

Mordecai: Oh! Hey Benson--

Benson: No.

Rigby: We could--

Benson: No!

Mordecai: Come on, Benson, just hear us out!

Benson: (Moans) Fine. What is it?

Rigby: We could have a scary movie night!

Mordecai: Yeah, in the abandoned cemetery!

Benson: You guys want to see a scary movie there?

Mordecai: Yes.

Benson: You know what? That could actually work. That's not a bad idea!

Muscle Man: Aw, what?

Skips: Yeah. We had a movie night there a long time ago. It was a huge success!

Pops: Ooh! A night of the macabre in the crypt! How exciting!

Benson: Alright, it's settled then. (Gives everyone their jobs) Skips, you'll set up the chairs.

Skips: Hmph.

Benson: Pops, you'll be in charge of concession.

(Pops laughs) 

Benson (continued): Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, you'll be in charge of decoration duties.

Muscle Man: Yeah! (High fives Hi Five Ghost)

Benson: I'll be in charge of admissions. Mordecai and Rigby... (Pause) You're in charge of getting the movie and getting the word out. But if this doesn't work, you won't be getting a paid day off.

Mordecai: Pfft, it's gonna work.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Rapping) Because we know everything about scary movies, and you know nothing about scary movies! We'll save the park with our knowledge of scary movies!

Benson: STOP SINGING OR YOU'RE FIRED!

Mordecai and Rigby: Our... knowledge... of... scary... movies.

Mordecai: We'll go get the movie.

(Mordecai and Rigby go to Movie Shack Hut)

Mordecai: You find anything yet?

(Scene goes to inside the Movie Shack Hut)

Rigby: We gotta get this one!

(Screen goes to a videocasette of Mounties of Death: Hoser Spree)

Rigby (continued): Mounties of Death: Hoser Spree!

Mordecai: Eh, the book was better. (Puts back the tape) Oh, this is a classic of Italian horror!

(Screen goes to a VHS of Libraria: Beware the Dewey Dethimal System)

Mordecai (continued): Libraria!

Rigby: Dude, what is with you? Nobody's gonna want to read subtitles!

Movie Shack Hut Employee: Oh, so you guys think you know about horror? Come into my lair.

(Gets a DVD from under the counter)

Movie Shack Hut Employee (continued): This is from my personal stash.

(Mordecai and Rigby look at it and the screen goes up to show the case. Scary music is heard in the background.)

Movie Shack Hut Employee (continued): Zombocalypse 3D!

Rigby: Oh yeah, I saw this a few years back.

Movie Shack Hut Employee: No you didn't.

Rigby: Huh?

Movie Shack Hut Employee: This is the foreign boot-leg director's cut. 3 hours and 28 minutes of remastered pee your pants horror and gore that will make your eyeballs barf!

Mordecai: Wait. (Takes the tape out of the case) What kind of tape is this?

Movie Shack Hut Employee: Duh, Zetamax 3D, it's like the only way to truly experience this movie. Of course you'll need... (He groans as he  picks up the projector) one of these babies. The Zetamax Decktron LX. It'll make those zombies really pop.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whooooa..

(The employee smiles)

Mordecai: We'll take it.

Movie Shack Hut Employee: W Wise choice.  (He picks up  a bunch of dirty 3D glasses) Here, you guys are gonna need some of these babies. (Zooms in on the glasses) I'll go ring you guys up. 

Mordecai and Rigby: Paid day-off!

(They high-five and it cuts to a montage)

(The montage shows Mordecai and Rigby going to the cementary to clean up which is covered in garbage, Mordecai and Rigby handing out posters but no one takes them, Skips is seen reading the newspaper, Mordecai and Rigby set up the projector, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are making decorations, Mordecai and Rigby hanging up posters, Benson at the Snack Bar and people show up, Mordecai and Rigby at Horror-Con passing out the posters, a line of people come to get their tickets at the Snack Bar and money is falling around Benson. Montage ends and goes to the cementary, Skips hands out the 3D glasses and Pops is making cotton candy)

Pops: Get your candy cob webs on a stick!

Benson: I can't believe it. They actually did it!

Muscle Man: I STILL think we should've had a sports tournament. If this movie night fails, which I know it will, I've got my sports gear here as a back-up plan.

(Muscle Man drops the equipment on the ground)

Muscle Man: You dudes are gonna thank me for this.

(Muscle Man walks away and Rigby starts the movie, the crowd cheers; the movie begins with the Zombie Slayer walking down a street)

Zombie Slayer: I was your average everyday kinda guy but that was before IT all happened. Before the satellite triggered the deadly necro virus and took everything I ever knew.

(A zombie comes out of a car window)

Zombie Slayer: Batter up!

(He hits the zombie with his bat which makes the zombie hit the screen and the title comes up)

Zombie Slayer: This is Zombocalypse 3D!

(The crowd cheers)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah-yuh! (They hi-five each other)

(The movie shows Zombie Slayer and his girlfriend in a house while the zombies are outside)

Zombie Slayer: Don't worry baby. I got these suckers. Baby?

(His girlfriend turns out to be a zombie)

 Zombie Slayer: Oh, great!

(She tackles him and hisses; the crowd gasps)

Rigby: (Shaking) Oh man, oh man, oh man!

Zombie Slayer: Baby, you let yourself go real bad.

(She groans; Mordecai grabs Rigby's shoulder which makes Rigby yell and knock over the projector, causing the film to stop; the crowd boos)

Rigby: Dude, why did you do that?

Mordecai: I didn't know you'd freak out that bad.

Man: Hey I want my money back!

(Others agree and Benson, who's in the crowd, turns around to see Mordecai and Rigby)

Benson: Fix it! Fix It!

Mordecai: Come on, come on!

(They put the projector back on the box, Rigby blows on the tape then spits on it)

Mordecai: Aw, why did you spit on it?

Rigby: Shut up, shut up, shut up!

(Rigby puts it in the projector the wrong way and it doesn't work)

Mordecai: Dude, why isn't it working?

Benson: (Slamming his chair against the ground) Fix it! FIX IT! FIX IT!

(Rigby gets on the projector and shakes it; it causes rays to go out and into the ground while one of which hits a guy)

Man: Ow my kidneys!

(A zombie is seen awakening and Mordecai takes the tape out)

Mordecai: Aw dude, you put it in backwards!

(Mordecai puts it in the projector the right way)

Mordecai: There.

(The movie continues playing, the crowd cheers and Benson goes back to watching the movie)

Mordecai and Rigby: Phew.

Rigby: Hmph, hmph. Thanks for almost getting rid of our paid day-off, you loser.

(A zombie is seen coming out of the ground, rips the screen and walks toward the crowd)

Rigby: Whoa.....The zombies really do pop out at you.

Mordecai: Totally. That one is coming really far off the screen. Wait, we're not wearing our 3D glasses.

(The zombie walks up to a man and grabs his arm)

Man: (Chuckles) Hey guys, check this out.

Rigby: That's a real zombie!

(The zombie is about to bite his arm)

Mordecai: Oh man, oh man, what do we do?!

(Zombie Slayer grabs a round chainsaw blade)

Zombie Slayer: Hey, worm bait!

(He throws it and it decapitates the zombie)

Zombie Slayer: Heads up.

(The crowd cheers)

Mordecai: Muscle Man's sport stuff!

(They run to the pile, Mordecai picks up a discus, throws it, and decapitates the zombie)

Rigby: Dude, nice shot. (The ground shakes) What's happening now?!

Zombie Slayer: Okay, genius, let me put this in terms that you'll understand: (The zombies come out of the ground) The thing you just did, it's woken up the dead - and they're ticked off!

(The zombies walk towards the crowd and their arms are seen reaching towards the crowd)

Mordecai:  Dude, if anyone gets hurt, we won't get our paid day-off. We gotta keep the zombies away from the people.

(Mordecai grabs discus' and Rigby grabs javelins and they yell)

Man: (Reaches out towards the zombie) Oh cool.

(A javelin is thrown into the zombie)

Man: Aw man, zombie just took a hit!

(Various zombies are seen killed by discus')

Man: Whoa, did you see that zombie get a discus to the face?

(The crowd cheers; Rigby fights off the zombies and matches Zombie Slayer's moves in the movie, a zombie grabs Rigby's javelin)

Rigby: Whoa!

(The zombie pushes him which makes Rigby stab another zombie causing its head to be stabbed, Rigby hits 2 zombies and hits the one that pushed him)

Rigby: No!

(A javelin gets thrown into a zombie's back and it is shown that Muscle Man threw it)

Muscle Man: Yo guys! I told you this stuff would come in handy!

(3 zombies are seen walking near Muscle Man, HFG, Rigby, and Mordecai; Skips grabs a long stick laying against a tree)

Skips: Duck!

(Skips screams and runs towards the zombies while Zombie Slayer does the same thing on the screen; Skips stabs the 3 zombies, flips, and crushes their heads; Zombie Slayer is kneeling)

Zombie Slayer: Better fire up the grill 'cause I got me a zombie-kabob!

(The crowd cheers; Goes to Pops who's laughing while zombies go near him)

Pops: Now, now. Don't crowd, there's enough for everybody.

Mordecai: Pops!

(Mordecai throws a discus which decaptates all the zombies; a zombie grabs Pops' shoulder and screams)

Muscle Man: Hey worm hole! Get a tasty lick of this!

(Muscle Man throws a shot put ball and it decapitates it)

 Benson: (Reaches out to a zombie) Wow, this is awesome.

(Mordecai screams; decapitates the zombie with a discus and the head bounces off Benson's head and he laughs thinking its 3D; Scene goes to a grave nearby with the name Howard "Hellion" Fightington and a big, muscular arm comes out of the ground)

 Mordecai: Dude, I think we got them all.

(Howard walks in front of the screen and looks similar to the big zombie seen in the movie; Howard cracks his neck and growls)

Mordecai: Skips, look out!

(Howard growls and Skips kicks his crotch but it turns to dust)

Skips: Oh no.

(Howard punches Skips, picks him up off the ground, and throws him to where Mordecai and Rigby are; Mordecai and Rigby throw their javelins but Howard catches them and throws them at them; Mordecai and Rigby barely get away and they groan in pain as they fall)

Mordecai: Ugh, he's just too strong.

Rigby: Mordecai! A cart!

(The zombies are blinded by the cart headlights while Zombie Slayer is seen in a car)

Mordecai: Okay you lousy, undead creep-

Zombie Slayer: - You've taken a lot from me but if you think you're gonna deprive me of my-

Mordecai: -paid day-off-

Mordecai and Zombie Slayer: You're sorely mistaken!

(Both of them step on the gas and drive towards the zombies; Mordecai and Rigby nod to each other and leap out of the cart, surprising Howard and the cart explodes when it hits him, causing the screen to burn just as the movie ends; The crowd cheers)

Benson: Ha, yeah!

(Rigby is holding the box with money in it)

Mordecai: Dude, I think we totally did it.

Benson: (Laughs) That was great! It felt like I was in the actual movie! Aw man, you guys totally earned that paid day-off.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Hi-fiving each other) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Benson: And you're gonna earn another one cause we're doing this again tomorrow night, the exact same way.

(He laughs and walks away)

Mordecai: Uh.....do you think we can take that paid day-off tomorrow?

(The episode ends)

(Episode starts at the computer.)

Rigby: Mordecai! Mordecai! Oh, there you are. You want half of this grilled cheese?

Mordecai: Whoa! Is that a grilled cheese deluxe from Cheezer's?

Rigby: Yes, it is.

Mordecai: Then, yes.

(They eat the sandwiches)

Mordecai: How did you manage this?

Rigby: I bought it. With money.

Mordecai: Nice! Hey, you know what would go good with these sandwiches? Funny internet videos! Dude, check this out. (Begins typing in name on the keyboard)

Rigby: No, wait! I know a really good one. (Types on the keyboard)

Mordecai: No, man! Youre just gonna pull up that ostrich thing with the balls again.

Rigby: No, Im not.

Mordecai: Youre typing it in! I see it!

Rigby: Dude, dont look! Youre gonna ruin it!

Mordecai: Fine. It better not be that ostrich thing with the balls. Ready yet?

Rigby: Its loading. Okay... Now!

(Mordecai un-covers his eyes to see a video about an ostrich playing baseball while an old man watches it.)

Woman: (In video, off-screen) Dont get too close now, Pa!

(The ostrich hits a baseball off the tee, pecks the old man in the groin, and raises its wings. Rigby laughs.)

Mordecai: Man, its that ostrich thing with the balls! Why do you gotta lie to me, dude?

Rigby: Cause lyings my specialty.

(Benson comes in very angry.)

Benson: What are you doing with my sandwich?!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Dont worry. Ill take care of this with my specialty. This isnt your sandwich. This is our sandwich.

Benson: This is your sandwich, huh? Then how come it says "Benson" on the bag?

Rigby: Huh? its supposed to say "Rigby," but they misspelled my name wrong.

Benson: STOP LYING!!!

Mordecai: Dude, I thought you said you bought this!

Benson: No, he didn't buy it! Now get off your lazy butts and go get me another Grilled Cheese Deluxe!!! (Slams the door shut)

Mordecai: Argh! You ruined our day off!

Rigby: Ah, dont worry, dude. The line wont be that long.

(Scene goes to Cheezers. The line is extremely long.)

Mordecai: Thanks for saving the day with your specialty, you idiot.

Rigby: Whatever. Like you could do any better.

Mordecai: Pfff. Im a better liar than you are.

Rigby: Oh, really? The only thing youre better than me at is being a big piece of-

(Mordecai punches Rigby in the stomach. Meanwhile two astronauts in blue jackets, Barry & Jones, go around the line and enter the restaurant.)

Mordecai: Hey! Argh! What the...? Those pork loins are cutting! Argh!

Fat woman: Excuse me! Those fine men are astronauts! They can cut in line. They fought for our country! Huh!

Rigby: (Rises off the ground and gasps) Dude, heres your chance to prove youre a better liar than me. Or maybe you cant? Look at your face. (Touches Mordecai's face all around) It must really eat you up inside to not be able to prove youre a better liar than me. Cause you can prove nothing. You, Cant, Prove, Anything!

Mordecai: (Slaps away Rigby's hand and picks him up) Fine! You want me to prove Im a better liar than you? Why wouldnt we see who is better in lying? Whoever gets caught first loses.

Rigby: Okay. Its not like youre ever gonna lie better than thi-i-is...

(Mordecai drops Rigby.)

Mordecai: Ahem, excuse me, Miss.

Fat woman: What?

Mordecai: We're astronauts. (They enter the Cheezers, cutting in line.) Bam! I told you Im a better liar than you!

Rigby: Woah, woah, woah! Step aside. Ill show you how a real man lies. (Approaches a counter) Hey, baby. Give me a Grilled Cheese Deluxe and make it snappy, cause were astronauts and we gotta get back up in space. Know what Im sayin?

Cheezer's Cashier: Oh, my. (Speaks using a loudspeaker) One Grilled Cheese Deluxe for the astronauts. (The announcement arouses the real astronauts curiosity.) Thatll be two fifty.

Rigby: Bam! Thats a moon quarter. (Points to a quarter)

Cheezer's Cashier: Oh! (Takes the money)

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. See?

Mordecai: Dude, that was lame.

Cheezer's Cashier: Excuse me, sir. Your Grilled Cheese is ready.

Mordecai: Thanks. We gotta get this back to our astronaut captain. Know what Im sayin'? Hmm! Hmm!

Cheezer's Cashier: Oh, is that your astronaut captain over there?

Mordecai: Huh? (Sees Rigby talking with Barry & Jones) ARGHHHH!!! (Comes up to them)

Rigby: This is the guy.

Jones: (Very indignant) Youre the guy?

Mordecai: Im...

Rigby: Hmm, hmm!

Mordecai: (Unsure) Im the guy...

Jones: (Suddenly, Jones turns very excited. He is about to shake Mordecais hand.) Well! Its an honor to meet you, captain. Lieutenant Riggs here has told us a lot about you.

Barry: Yeah, its great to meet a couple of real fellow astronauts.

Jones: So, what are you guys doing in this dump hole, anyways?

Rigby: Ah, you know. We're just pickin' up a Grilled Cheese for our commanding officer.

Barry: Ha-ha! I hear that.

Mordecai: Ha, yeah. We were just getting ready to take it back to the compound.

Jones: Compound? We were just getting ready to go there ourselves. Wanna lift?

Mordecai: Uh, sure. Well take a ride to the compound.

Jones: Come to think of it, why havent we seen you around the compound before...?

Rigby: Weve just got back from a 10-year stand in the old shuttlecraft. Isnt that right, captain Mordecai?

Mordecai: Yeah. And weve just transferred here. Its our first day.

Jones: Well, welcome! Well be glad to show you around. Now, I hope youre up to spend a 2.5 million dollars of taxpayers money, cause were drivin.

(They use a kind of an Apollo-like spaceship as their vehicle and simply cross the street because the compound is located right opposite of the Cheezers.)

Jones: Gentlemen, welcome to the compound! ('Compound' echos)

Rigby: Oh, uh, I forgot my ID in my other pants. Can you help me out, guys?

Mordecai: Oh, what? That was my ID! I told you not to lose it!

Jones: Guys, guys, calm down. You can use our IDs. (They pass the checkpoint.) Here. You, guys, might be more comfortable in these. (Passes them jackets)

Rigby: Ah, thanks. Yeah, I love these things, but Captain Mordecai might not be that into 'em. Dont you like the uniforms in pink?

Jones: Pink?

Mordecai: I only had to borrow a pair that one time from... (Notices an employee list on the wall and quickly picks up a random name) Dr. Asinoskovich. That one time.

Jones: Ah, you know Dr. Asinoskovich? Thats funny. Because shes right here. (Points at a woman standing with her back towards them)

Dr. Asinoskovich: (Turns around and speaks with a Russian accent) I dont remember you.

Mordecai: Really? Uh... It was one time at that conference. You dont remember me?

Dr. Asinoskovich: Uh... I dont remember very much from that conference. I... have to go! (Runs away very quickly)

Jones: Wow! That was awkward. Ah, come on. Well give you the grand tour.

Mordecai: Dude, you should quit right now. Youre totally gonna get caught.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. Well see.

(Lies by Thompson Twins is being played while the astronauts are showing Mordecai and Rigby around.)

(Mordecai and Rigby wash their hands in the bathroom.)

Rigby: Man, I dont think you can last much longer. I think you should give it up.

Mordecai: They're not onto me.

Rigby: Then I guess its time that I start lying at one hundred percent. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?!

Jones: And what tour would be complete without a stop at the pride of our compound --- the antimatter chamber. (Slaps some clerk on his back) How is she running today, Jimmy?

Jimmy: Well, actually, sir... Thereve been some problems maintaining safe levels of-

Jones: (Slaps Jimmy again, causing Jimmy to drop his clipboard right onto a green button, pushing it) Thats fate. I dont understand a half of that these science types say.

Rigby: Oh, thats too bad. Captain heres an expert on it.

Jones: Youre an expert on antimatter?

Mordecai: Uh... Yeah... Uh... But not compared to how much this guy knows. (Points to Rigby)

(An alert beeper sound grows stronger.)

Rigby: (Frustrated) Uh...

Mordecai: Did you know he wrote a book on it?

Rigby: We wrote a book on it.

Mordecai: Well, you did the most of the work on it.

Rigby: But your names on the cover.

Mordecai: Yeah, right next yours.

Rigby: Above mine!

Jones: Jimmy, knock off that beepin.

Jimmy: Yeah, actually, sir, Im having trouble with-

Jones: Trouble? We-ell, these guys are experts! Can you lend a hand, fellas?

Rigby: Sure, we can. Go ahead, Captain.

Mordecai: (Approaches the control panel) Well, according to the book lieutenant Rigby wrote, you wanna turn that knob there.

(Jimmy follows the orders.)

Rigby: (Cuts in) But captains own research really out-dates mine. So turn that knob over there.

Mordecai: But hes forgetting the recent discoveries he made. Flip those switches.

Rigby: Discoveries based on his studies... Hit those buttons.

Mordecai: I never said hit those buttons!

Rigby: Yeah, Jimmy, youre not doing like Captain Mordecai said! You gotta do it like this! (Bumps over all the buttons)

(The anti-nucleus gets unstable. Pipes burst. Danger light bulbs explode.)

Mordecai: Dude, quit! Youre gonna break it!

Rigby: No, youre gonna break it!

Major Williams: Whats all this commotion?

Jones: Major Williams? Sir! (Dusts off Mordecai and Rigby) We were just showing these new transfers around the compound, sir.

(A warning siren is heard.)

Jimmy: Captain Mordecai! Lieutenant Riggs! The antimatter is becoming unstable!

(Shows the antimatter wobbling in a mass.)

Jones: Captain Mordecai, Lieutenant Riggs. You can fix it, right?

Mordecai: Yes. Lieutenant Riggs can totally fix it.

Rigby: Not without captains help!

Jones: No time for modesty! (He opens the antimatter chamber door and shoves Mordecai and Rigby in there.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is all your fault.

Rigby: What? Youre the one who wont admit that you suck at lying.

Mordecai: Cause I dont!

(The others watch Mordecai and Rigby argue through the window.)

Rigby: Why don't you give up and tell em whats going on so they can help us?

Mordecai: No, you do it.

Rigby: No way!

(The antimatter shakes even more.)

Mordecai: Arghhh!! Fine.

Jones: Whats the holdup?

Mordecai: Look. I have to tell you the truth. (Rigby nods.) I have a condition that makes me forget everything in times of extreme stress. (Rigby's mouth hangs open in shock.) Lieutenant Riggs doesnt have that condition. Hes just an idiot.

Rigby: Hey!

Mordecai: We need you tell us what to do.

Jones: Oh, my... Jimmy, what do we do?

Jimmy: They have to penetrate the anti-nucleus with something solid!

Jones: Right! Listen up! You have one chance at this thing. You have to throw Lieutenant Riggs into the anti-nucleus.

Rigby: WHAT?!?!

Jones: Its the only way. Captain Mordecai is too big for you to throw. You must sacrifice yourself to save thousands of lives, lieutenant!

Rigby: NO!! Dont listen to him, Mordecai! DONT DO IT!!!!

Jones: Do it! Throw him in! THROW HIM IN!!!

(Mordecai looks around, conflicted.)

Rigby: Please! No! No!

Jones: Throw him now! NOW!!!

Rigby: Im sorry! Im sorry for lying! You win, okay? I wont lie anymore!

Mordecai: Its too late, Rigby. I cant let everybody die because of us. (Mordecai lifts Rigby up over his head and is about to throw him in...)

Rigby: NO!!!!

(A zip sound is heard.)

Rigby: Huh? (Sees that his jacket is unzipped)

Mordecai: You thought I was gonna throw you in? I told you Im a better liar than you. (Holds the grilled cheese bag in his hand)

Rigby: Bensons grilled cheese!

Mordecai: You better hope this works. Huh!

(Mordecai throws a bag with grilled cheese into the anti-nucleus. The anti-nucleus catches the bag with its energy field. Then it catches Rigby...)

Rigby: Nyahh!

Mordecai: Rigby! Ahh!

(...and Mordecai as well. It twists, rips them up, and puts them back together, then explodes. It then throws them out, knocking over the chamber door. They both look roasted enough. They groan and cough as they look up at the others.)

Rigby: Were not astronauts.

(Cut to the Park. Barry and Jones hurl Mordecai and Rigby out of a van.)

Jones: If you ever lie about being astronauts again, YOURE DEAD!!!

Rigby: We saved the city, astro-

(The astronauts throw the Cheezer's bag in Rigby's face and drive away.)

(Benson is on the computer as they enter his room.)

Benson: Where have you been? Ive been waiting all day.

(Mordecai gives Benson his Grilled Cheese Deluxe. It is totally burned.)

Benson: What the...? What happened to my sandwich?

Rigby: There were spacemen! At Cheezers! And the tube... we went down and... everyone wore sweatpants... even us... and then the room with the bad stuff... but... we saved the city with your sandwich!

Benson: Ugh!... Why do you always have to lie to my face?!

Mordecai: We ran it over by accident.

(Pause)

Benson: See? Was it so hard to tell the truth?

(The episode opens with a wide front view of Mr. Maellard's house. Mordecai, Rigby and Benson are at the door. Benson knocks on the door.)

Benson: Hello, Mr. Maellard! Huh, looks like he's not home. Help me bring these boxes inside, but don't touch anything or you're both fired.

Mordecai: Ok, ok.

(Benson pushes the doors open and enters Mr Maellard's house with Mordecai and Rigby following from behind)

Mordecai: Man, what's in these boxes?

Rigby: Yeah, this stuff is heavy.

Benson: Whatever it is, I'm sure its incredibly expensive, so be careful.

(Rigby places the box on the floor and wipes off sweat from his head)

Rigby: Phew! I wonder where the pool is?

(Both Rigby and Mordecai push a door open and enter a room with a lot of prized artifacts and other interesting objects)

Mordecai & Rigby: Wooahhhhh...

(In front of Mordecai and Rigby is a giant flat screen T.V. with an image of a dollar sign zooming up and down the screen)

Mordecai: That's the flattest flat screen I've ever seen.

(Rigby pushes a button on the wall and the flat screen drops downwards, revealing a large aquarium containing an octopus, a whale and three other fish)

Rigby: Nice. Arrgh!

(Benson yells at Rigby for touching the stuff)

Benson: Quit snooping around! Get upstairs and put those boxes away so we can leave before you two destroy the place.

Rigby: Fine, fine.

(Some classical music starts playing as Rigby puts a box down and leaves the room, and soon Mordecai leaves the room as well. Benson is left to pick up Rigby's box. Then through the open doors of another room we see Mordecai, Rigby and Benson, who walk past the room carrying boxes. However, Benson takes a few steps backwards, and looks into the room he had just walked past. There are several collectors items in there, such as a pharaoh's head, a sports car, an old classic car, a tyrannosaurus rex bone model and a bronze statue.)

Benson: Woah.

(Benson walks towards a glass cabinet holding a white guitar)

Benson: Is that a signed Bruce rock guitar?

(He looks at his reflection In the glass cabinet, and has a flashback. As a teenager he is seen being held up by a crowd that is cheering at a Bruce Rock concert that he had went to when he was younger.)

Bruce Rock: Are you ready to get rocked?!

(Then it shows Benson standing up in what looks like a black mustang, with his friend driving. They appear to be following the Bruce Rock tour Bus. It then shows a map of America where Bruce Rock went to different concerts. Then Bruce Rock is shown performing, and we see Benson in the audience smiling, until he views his own reflection again and comes back to reality. He pauses and thinks for a second before opening the glass cabinet and taking out the signed Bruce Rock guitar. He puts the shoulder strap over his shoulder and strums the guitar.)

Benson: Hahahahahahahah! (He looks around to make sure no one is watching him) Yeahhhh! (He strums the guitar like he is a rock star) Wooohoooo! Are you ready to get rocked?!

(Benson gets so excited, he jumps into the air with glee. However, when he does this, he accidentally ends up breaking the guitar by smashing the top part of it against the bronze statue. Mordecai and Rigby then enter the room.)

Rigby: Benson, we're finished, we can-

Mordecai & Rigby: Woah!

(Benson is standing there with the broken Bruce Rock guitar, a shocked look on his face)

Mordecai: What happened to not touching anything?

Benson: I... I don't know! I got carried away. This guitar is worth more than my life! Maellard is going to fire me for sure if he doesn't kill me first!

Mordecai: Ok, ok, wait. It might not be so bad. Maybe we can find some glue and...

Benson: (Lets out a loud cry) Arghhhaarrghhh! I'm ruined! There's no way I can... (Looks up in realization) Wait! You two! You can help me.

Rigby: Uh, we can?

Benson: You guys are always wrecking stuff and getting away with it; you're practically experts!

Mordecai: (Looks down at Rigby and then back up at Benson) Hm, we're totally experts. Don't worry, Benson, we can help you fix this.

Benson: You can?

Mordecai: Sure! All we gotta do is get another signed Bruce Rock guitar, and then we'll sneak it in here before Maellard realizes anything's wrong. Don't worry, dude, with our help, you're not gonna get fired.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson in the computer room, using the computer to find out if there are any Bruce Rock tickets online. Mordecai is typing on the computer with Rigby and Benson sitting beside him.)

Mordecai: Alright. The way I see it, Bruce Rock is always on tour, right?

Benson: Yeah.

Rigby: Well then the best way to see him is to go to his next concert, and then just go up to him and ask for another autographed guitar.

Mordecai: Oh, hey, what do you know? He's playing tonight.

Benson: Are you serious? He's in town? That's amazing! (Laughs) Man, you guys really are good.

Mordecai & Rigby: Hehehe, yeah.

Mordecai: Let's buy the tickets.

(Mordecai tries to buy the tickets, but a message pops up saying that they're sold out)

Rigby: Aw man, it's sold out!

Benson: Oh no! I'm gonna get fired and lose all of my retirement benefits! Oh man, oh man!

Mordecai: Dude, just relax.

Rigby: Yeah, the first plan never works.

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson decide to go to Muscle Man, who appears to be welding something. Muscleman turns around and lifts his face protection mask.)

Muscle Man: Talk to me.

Mordecai: Benson broke Maellard's guitar that was signed by Bruce Rock...

Muscle Man: Ah! Say no more bro, I'll give my buddy Ronnie a call, he'll take care of it for you.

Rigby: Who's Ronnie?

Muscle Man: He's one of Bruce Rocks roadies; he can totally get Benson another signed guitar.

Benson: Nice.

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmhmhmhmhm!

Mordecai: Thanks, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: No worries.

(Muscle Man gets back to his welding, but he is actually just cooking a T-bone steak on a barbecue grill with a welding torch)

Muscle Man: Mmmmmmm, T-bone.

(It is night time and Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Muscle Man are at the Bruce rock concert, which is taking place at the convention center. There is a large group of Bruce Rock fans who are waiting outside, shouting Bruce Rocks's name over and over.)

Crowd: Bruce Rock! Bruce Rock! Bruce Rock! Bruce!

(The camera then zooms in to the side alleyway of the convention center, where Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Muscle Man are standing. Muscle Man is talking to Ronnie.)

Muscle Man: Thanks again for doing this, Ronnie.

Ronnie: Hey, don't mention it bro; I still owe you for that night outside of Dooley's.

Muscle Man: Hehehehe. (Muscle Man and Ronnie high five each other)

Benson: It's Bruce Rock! It's Bruce Rock!

Ronnie: Hey Bruce, this is the guy Benson that I was telling you about.

Bruce Rock: Hey; what's up, man?

Benson: Mr. Rock, I would just like to say that it is an honor.

Bruce Rock: Right on, brother. I'll sign this guitar for you after the show. Hey: stay gold.

Benson: Thanks, Bruce!

Rigby: Man, he is looking old!

Benson: Hey, have some respect, he's an American icon!

Bruce Rock: Are you ready to get rocked?!

(The crowd cheers, and Benson raises his arms in the air)

Benson: Wooohoooo! I can't believe he's jamming after all these years. Bruce Rock is gonna live forever!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson are just standing there, enjoying the music, when suddenly, something is heard crashing down, and a high pitched sound blares from the microphone.)

Anonymous: Somebody call an ambulance!

(The guys are at home watching the news report on T.V. A news reporter and an image of a helicopter lifting a body is shown.)

News Reporter: We have received confirmation that American icon Bruce Rock has died after tragically falling off a five-foot stage. Sources say that Bruce's old, old body just couldn't handle the fall.

Benson: I'm finished. This job was everything I had.

Mordecai: Relax, Benson, we already have a backup plan for situations like this.

Benson: (Sighs) Fine, what's the backup plan?

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson visiting Death's house)

Death: Ain't no way you can contact Bruce Rock. When someone like him dies, they end up in the Rock and Roll Underworld. It's very exclusive. You're forbidden to enter unless you're a bonefied rock star, and you three losers don't exactly fit that description.

Rigby: Losers?! We're totally rock and roll.

Mordecai: Down to the bones.

Death: Fine, but you own me big. When you least expect it, you're gonna have to babysit Thomas.

Mordecai: We accept.

Benson: I won't have to babysit Thomas, will I?

Mordecai: Nah, we'll weasel out of it somehow.

Death: Now we gotta make you guys look like proper rock stars.

(Some type of rock music starts playing. Death hands Benson some clothes, Mordecai puts on a glove, Rigby puts on a pair of trousers with suspenders, and Benson puts on a leather jacket. Then the music ends with them standing there looking like rock stars.)

Death (continued): Now you need some Rock and Roll names.

Rigby: I'm gonna be 'Awesome Johnson'!

Mordecai: I wanna be 'Five - Knuckle Joe'.

Rigby: 'Rusty skull Bone'.

Mordecai: 'Lightning Jimmy-Joe Johnson'!

Death: Those are the worst Rock and Roll names I've ever heard. For this plan to work, they have to be just right. (Death points at Mordecai) Zander Mercury. (Death points at Rigby) King Pluto. (Death points at Benson) Max Amps.

Mordecai: Woah... good names.

Death: I know. Now let's go.

(The guys follow Death to his motorcycle)

Death (continued): Everyone on.

(Death revs his motorcycle and dives into a portal, which souls are seen flying out of)

Mordecai Rigby & Benson: Ahhhhh!

(The motorcycle bounces and lands on the ground, stopping right in front of the entrance of the Rock and Roll Underworld.)

Death: Welcome to the Rock and Roll Underworld.

(The camera shows an evil looking bouncer guarding the entrance)

Benson: How are we gonna get past that guy?

Death: Don't worry about him. I'm gonna put you guys on the list.

(Death sends a wave of light towards the clipboard with his mind and inserts their names on the list)

Death (continued): Now act like you belong.

(Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Death walk towards the entrance of the Rock and Roll Underworld, approaching the bouncer)

Death (continued): Their tour bus just flew off a cliff, aint that right boys?

(Death punches Mordecai)

Mordecai: Yeah, I'm Zander Mercury, and these two jokers are King Pluto and Max Amps.

Rigby: We're on the list.

(The bouncer checks his list to see if the three names are on it, which they are. He then looks back up at Mordecai, Rigby and Benson before crossing out the the names with his pen.)

Rigby (continued): Cooool.

Bouncer: Alright, you guys are good.

(He unhooks a chain, allowing them to enter)

Death: This is as far as I can go. And remember what I told you: if you're caught, you'll be exiled to the Fake Rockstar Underworld for all eternity!

Benson: Wait, what? You never told us that.

Death: Yeah I did. I'm... pretty sure I did. Back at the, uh...

(Snaps his fingers)

Benson: (Turns to Mordecai and Rigby) No, he didn't! Gaaaah! I can't believe I'm doing this; just take me back, I don't wanna do this anymore!

(The bouncer turns to look at him)

Rigby: Hey, cool it! You wanna keep your job or not?

Mordecai: Yeah, settle down, Benson. You asked for our expertise, well this is how we roll. Now let's get that guitar.

(They enter the Rock and Roll Underworld. Several people are walking around and talking.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Woah!

Mordecai: This place is crazy!

Rigby: Woah, is that Igby Stallion over there?

(The camera shows a guy sitting beside a guitar that is on fire. He then proceeds to place a steak in the flames.)

Mordecai: (Pointing) And I'm pretty sure that's Ronnie Rugburn sitting over at that table.

(Ronnie bites into what appears to be wood)

Rigby: Dude, there goes Crash!

(A guy with long hair and a guitar walks by)

Mordecai: Wait, isn't Crash still alive?

Rigby: Oh, yeah... maybe he has a day pass or something.

Benson: (Points) Ah! At the back of the club! There's Bruce!

(They all run to the back of the club yelling 'Bruce')

Bruce Rock: Ah, hey boys; good to see ya.

Mordecai: Hi, sir. Sorry about the whole dying thing.

Bruce Rock: Pffft, you kidding me? I love being dead. Down here I can rock for all eternity! I feel young again.

Rigby: Yeah, you don't look super old like you did before you died.

Bruce Rock: Thanks! You boys still need that signed guitar?

Benson: Yes, sir. If... that's okay?

Bruce Rock: Of course! Now, who has a pen?

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson just look at each other)

Benson: Nobody brought a pen? You have got to be kidding me.

Mordecai: Wait. I know where we can get one.

(The camera zooms in to the bouncer's pen, and then the bouncer himself)

Benson: You want to ask the bouncer for his pen?

Mordecai: Yeah! Couldn't hurt to ask.

(An anonymous man walks up to the bouncer)

Anonymous: Oi, mate, can I borrow your pen?

(The bouncer grabs the man and throws him up into the ceiling, where he explodes)

Benson: No way! I'm not going anywhere near that guy.

Mordecai: Listen; this is the point of no return, where you have to take a huge risk for a huge reward.

(Benson realizes this and sighs. He then proceeds to walk up to the bouncer.)

Benson: Excuse me. I noticed your jacket earlier and... I was wondering. Is that leather?

(As Benson is distracting the bouncer, Mordecai and Rigby sneak up and try to grab the bouncer's pen. Before they can get ahold of it, however, the bouncer crosses his arms, putting the pen out of reach.

Benson (continued): (Laughs nervously) Uh... I just wanted to let you know it looks great. And uh...

(Mordecai is seen walking back over with Rigby on his shoulders)

Benson (continued): It kind of looks like my jacket! 

(Rigby reaches for the pen)

Benson (continued): Except mine doesn't have the skulls. It has... tassles. You see? Tassles...

(Rigby is finally able to reach the pen. He is shown holding onto Mordecai eyelids, however, and Mordecai's legs are wobbling from Rigby's weight. No sooner does Rigby touch the pen, the duo fall right in front of the bouncer.)

Bouncer: Hey! (He takes back his pen and picks up Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson) Who'd you say you guys were again?

Mordecai: Zander Mercury.

Benson: Max Amps.

Rigby: Uh... uh... Max King!

(The bouncer gives him an unconvinced look)

Rigby: (Looks down) Um... muscles! King Muscles!

Bouncer: Prove it!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson are then seen on stage in front of a bunch of people)

Bouncer (continued): Come on! Play something!

Mordecai: Alright. Let's do this! One, two, three, four!

(They all horribly start to play their instruments)

Rigby: (off-key) Yeah! (Bangs on a keyboard) We're rock and roooooooooll!

Bouncer: You guys aren't rockstars!

(He turns into a griffin-like creature and swoops down towards Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson. The three friends scream in terror. The bouncer quickly grabs them before they can react.)

Bouncer (continued): You guys just bought yourselves a one way ticket to the Fake Rockstar Underworld!

Benson: We're gonna be okay, right? This stuff happens all the time, right?!

Rigby: No, this has never happened!

(A portal opens up behind them. The bouncer tries to throw the fake rockstars in, but they hang onto each other. Mordecai quickly grabs onto the bouncer's arm and hits him in the face with Mr. Maellard's guitar, sending him to the ground in pain and giving himself, Rigby, and Benson a chance to escape.)

Mordecai: Get the pen!

(Bruce Rock, along with a big crowd of people, is seen cheering as they watch Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson outsmart the bouncer. Rigby decides to gloat as he takes the bouncer's pen.)

Rigby: In your faaace!

(As soon as he says this, the bouncer roars, causing Rigby to scream and run away with Benson and Mordecai)

Mordecai: Bruce! We got the pen!

(Bruce quickly takes the guitar and runs alongside Benson, Mordecai, and Rigby as the griffin pursues them. He writes his name down, which permanently becomes ingrained in the guitar.)

Bruce Rock: (Hands the guitar to Mordecai) Here.

Mordecai: Thanks, Mr. Rock.

Benson: Yeah, thanks, Mr. Rock.

Bruce Rock: And always remember: (He rolls away) Stay gooooooooold!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson continue running as the bouncer flies above them. They quickly duck under the chain that is covering the entrance as the bouncer bursts through the wall just over their heads.)

Death: Get on! 

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson quickly hop onto Death's motorcycle. Death takes off, only to be easily pursued the bouncer.)

Mordecai: Death!

Rigby: He's gaining on us!

(A portal opens up in front of them, right as the bouncer is about to catch up. Mordecai screams as the bouncer almost manages to grab him. Just before that can happen, however, Death pulls up on the handlebars and pulls them through the portal, leaving the griffin to fly around in defeat. They manage to arrive back at Death's house, though Death can't see that because his eyes are covered by Benson's hands.)

Death: I can't see!

(They end up crashing right beside the entrance of the house, destroying Death's motorcycle and leaving them all sprawled out on the ground. Luckily, Benson is able to pull himself up and grab the guitar.)

Benson: We did it!

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson back at Mr. Maellard's house. Benson is shown putting the guitar back in its place.)

Benson (continued): (Laughs) Man, you guys really bailed me out of that one.

Rigby: What can we say? It's what we do. (He gives Mordecai a high-five)

(Just then, Mr. Maellard walks into the room)

Benson: Mr. Maellard's coming! Be cool.

(Mordecai and Rigby quickly turn around)

Mr. Maellard: So, uh, you fellas like Bruce Rock, do ya?

Mordecai Rigby & Benson: Yeah.

Benson: My all-time favorite.

Mr. Maellard: Yeaaaah. (He walks over to the case and pulls out the guitar) I got this baby so that every now and then, I can feel like a rockstar.

(Right after he says this, he takes the guitar and smashes it on the ground, causing Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson to gasp and look on in pure shock)

Mr. Maellard (continued): It's good to be rich!

(End of Guitar of Rock)

(Episode opens with Mordecai mowing the lawn, Muscle Man digging a hole for a box and Hi Five Ghost washing a window. Mordecai checks the time on his watch. It is 6:00, meaning it's--)

Mordecai: Guy's night!

(The song "Party All The Time" by Eddie Murphy plays in the background while Muscle Man checks the exact same time on his radio, and realizes it's--)

Muscle Man: Guy's night!

(Rigby. who is cleaning the toilet, checks the exact same on his watch, and also knows it's--)

Rigby: Guy's night!

(Hi Five Ghost, who is wiping the windows, sees the time on the clock in the computer room, and also knows it's--)

Hi Five Ghost: Guy's night!

Mordecai: (hopping off the lawnmower) Guy's night!

Rigby: (flushing the toilet) Guy's night! (goes out of the park bathrooms)

(Muscle Man whoops away from the hole)

Hi Five Ghost: (throwing his stuff in celebration) Whoo-hoo! (flies off)

(Benson and Skips are walking off.)

Mordecai: Benson, guy's night!

Rigby: Guy's night, Benson!

Benson: Has a month passed already? (Skips nods in confirmation) All right, dont get too crazy.

Mordecai: Oh, you dont have to worry about us.

(cut to Pops's house hallways)

Mordecai and Rigby: Guy's night!

? Muscle Man and High Five Ghost:?  Guy's night!

(The guys put a bunch of snacks and drinks on the kitchen table.)

? All:?  Chips, chips, chips, chips!

(They scarf down the potato chips and throw away the bag.)

? Mordecai:?   (holding a chip and a flat can of salsa) You gotta scoop it. (eats) Scoop it. (eats)

? All:?  Soda, soda, soda, soda!

(Muscle Man pours two full bottles of soda into one cup, drinks it, and whoops. Cut to the guys staring at a magazine)

Rigby:?  Oh, yeah!

Muscle Man: She looks good.

Hi Five Ghost: I think Im in love.

Mordecai: Uh, yeah, Id parallel-park that.

(They laugh as they hear the doorbell ring. They run to the door)

All: (chanting) Za! Za! Za! Za! Za! Za! (opening the door) Pizza!

Pizza Guy: (chuckles) Guy's night?

All: GUY'S NIGHT! (They laugh. Cut to the scene where they play poker)

Muscle Man: OH!

Hi Five Ghost: OH!

Rigby: OH!

Mordecai: OH!

All: OHHHHHH!!!! (Transition to the scene where they play video games, laughing)

Rigby: Yeah, get it!

(More laughter)

Hi Five Ghost: (Holds a VHS tape) Movie time!

All: Movie! Movie! Movie! Movie!

(On the television screen, Sergeant AWOL is seen shooting a gun. Cut to all four on the couch)

All: OHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Pops: Oh, well, look at this. What are you all up to?

All: Guy's Night.

Muscle Man: Hey, Thomas, go get us more chips at the store. (Muscle Man throws keys at Thomas)

Thomas: (Picks up keys and sighs) Fine.

Pops: Uh, well, why didnt I receive an invitation to guys' night?

Mordecai: Well, we just didnt think youd like any of the stuff were doing.

Rigby: Yeah, you're not really a guy's guy. You're Pops.

Pops: Well, I can be one of the guys, too. Chanting! Chanting! Chanting!

Mordecai: I dont know, Pops. Its gonna take something tougher than chanting to be one of the guys.

Pops: Well, whats the toughest thing one of the guys can do on Guys' Night?

All: Milk challenge.

Pops: Ooh, whats that?

Mordecai: You have to drink a gallon of milk in an hour.

Rigby: Without getting sick.

Muscle Man: Toughest thing a guy can do.

High Five Ghost: Never seen a guy pull it off, though.

Pops: Sounds perfect!

All: What?

Pops: Ill beat that Milk Challenge, and then youll see who's one of the guys.

(Cut to everyone going into the kitchen.)

Hi Five Ghost: MILK! [repeats in background]

Mordecai: Pops, wait, are you sure you want to do this?

Rigby: The milk challenge is brutal.

Pops: But you and Rigby ate that giant omelet for a trucker's cap.

Mordecai: Yeah, but--

Pops: Muscle Man defeated the Wing Kingdom Wing Challenge. Even Hi Five Ghost drank a tub of creamed corn for that radio contest.

Hi Five Ghost: Best free tote bag ever! (He and Muscle Man high-five.)

Pops: Surely I can handle a gallon of milk.

Rigby: Uh...

Mordecai: I dont know, Pops.

Muscle Man: Chillax, bros. Pops is right. Weve all had our challenges. It was hard, but we didnt give up. Thats what made us guys. If Pops thinks he can handle it, we should let him try.

Mordecai: I guess.

Rigby: Okay.

Pops: HOORAY!

Pops, Hi Five Ghost and Muscle Man: MILK! MILK! MILK! MILK! MILK! MILK!

Muscle Man: All right, Pops, you have one hour. When you're done, you've got to hold the jug over your head, or it doesnt count, got it?

Pops: Hmm.

Hi Five Ghost: GO!

(Pops begins to chug down the milk)

Mordecai: Hes really doing it!

All: POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! 

(They continue to chant his name until Pops stops and drops the milk. He's ready to puke and runs to the bathroom.)

Muscle Man: Oh, no, bro!

(cut to Mordecai and Rigby waiting for Pops.)

Mordecai: Pops, are you okay?

(Pops flushes the toilet.)

Pops: (moaning) Did I finish?

Rigby: You didnt even make it halfway.

Mordecai: Dont feel bad, Pops. No one can drink that much milk.

Rigby: Yeah, well just hang out some other night.

Pops: Or we could hang out as fellow guys when I complete the milk challenge!

Rigby: You're gonna try again?

Pops: Of course. A guy never quits, right? (laughs)

All: POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS!

(Pops spits.)

All: POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS!

(Pops spits again.)

All: POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS!

(The timer dings. Pops moans and goes to the toilet again.)

All: Oh!

(Pops sighs.)

Rigby: Oh, man, Pops, do you need to see a doctor?

Pops: No. No.

Mordecai: Look, Pops, you gave it your all. Its an impossible task. You dont need to complete the challenge. Its fine. You can still be one of the guys, right, guys?

Muscle Man: Oh yeah, for sure.

Rigby: Totally, Pops.

Hi Five Ghost: Of course.

Pops: I dont want your charity... I want to earn being one of the guys the right way... (moans) I just need to lie down for a little while.

Rigby: But, Pops, youve already drank like 6 gallons of milk in total.

Pops: But none in one hour... (The scene fades to Pops lying on his bed in his bedroom.) Maybe theyre right. Maybe Im not meant to be one of the guys. No. Ahem.

Mordecai: Oh, hey, Pops. How are you feeling?

Pops: Im feeling like some milk, please.

Mordecai: Last gallon. Pops, you sure you want to do this?

(The timer starts ticking again. Pops gulps down the milk... and gulps some more... until he finishes the whole gallon before the hour is up. He sighs, then burps. Everyone cheers.)

Mordecai: Yeah, you did it, Pops!

Rigby: Yeah, Pops, you actually pulled it off!

Muscle Man: I cant believe it, bro!

Rigby: Wait, you got to raise the jug over your head, Pops!

All: Raise the jug! Raise the jug! Raise the jug! Raise the jug! Raise... Pops? POPS!

Mordecai: Pops! Can you hear me?!

Muscle Man: Oh, man, is he alright?

Rigby: Hes not alright, he's all white!

Mordecai: Quiet! Pops?! Pops!

(Pops wakes up in an elevator with a creature that looks like a drop of milk, with a mask. The creature signals Pops to follow it, which he does. )

Pops: What is this place? (The creature points to a tunnel as they walk to a white room. One of them offers him a glass of milk.) No thank you. (The creature leaves as Pops sees a group of people who won the milk challenge) Excuse me.

Tough Guy: You lost or something?

Pops: No. I mean, yes. I --

Tough Guy: Ah, just yanking your chain! We know why youre here. Milk challenge, right?

Pops: How did you know?!

Tough Guy: Thats why we're all here. Name's Russell. (A milk person offers him a glass of milk) Oh, thanks, man.

Pops: Im Pops. Who are they?

Russell: I dont know. Theyre just here to keep the milk flowing. This is paradise, Pops! Oh, congrats. You're one of the guys now.

All: Pops! Pops! Pops! Pops!

(Cut back to the kitchen where Rigby is trying to wake Pops up.)

Rigby: POPS? POPS?! Oh, man, hes still not waking up!

Mordecai: We need to call for help. (He goes to the phone to call 911)

Muscle Man: 911! 911! 911!

Mordecai: Dude, not cool.

Muscle Man: 9... 1-- Whatever. Its still guy's night.

(Cut back to the white room where the guys are still chanting)

All: Pops! Pops! Pops! Pops!

Russell: Hey, take a load off, man. You earned it.

Pops: But I didnt earn it. I havent completed the challenge yet.

Russell: What do you mean?

Pops: I never lifted the jug over my head.

Russell: Well, you're one of the guys now. You must have.

Pops: Im quite certain I didnt. I only have a few minutes left.

Russell: Thats impossible! We all beat the challenge! Thats why we're here!

Other Guy 1: Actually, I didnt lift the jug either.

Other Guy 2: I dont think I did.

Other Guy 3: Yeah, I didnt.

Other Guy 4: Were we supposed to?

Russell: No, that's-- wait, did I? Huh. I cant remember. (A milk person offers him another glass of milk, but he slams it to the ground.) I dont want any more milk! Whats going on? We're here because we beat it, right? ANSWER ME!

(The milk person removes his mask to reveal he has sharp teeth, as the rest of the milk people have as well.)

Pops: Somethings wrong. We should go to the elevator.

Russell: No way. We're gonna stay and fight. Am I right, guys?

(The milk people bite one guy and he changes into a milk person. The guys gasp in shock)

Russell: EVERYBODY, FOLLOW POPS!

(The guys fight the milk people, but as they attack Pops, Russell grabs one off of him and throws it aside, then the milk people chase the guys. The milk people gets another guy and devour him.)

Pops: COME ON!

(Russell and the two remaining guys go to the elevator as Pops sees a "way out" button. A milk person opens the doors and growls at them as they scream, but Pops kicks him out as the rest of the milk people are still charging. Pops presses the "way out" button and the elevator moves up)

Russell: Oh man, thanks Pops, we wouldnt have gotten out of there without you.

Other Guy: Do you still think theres enough time to complete the challenge?

Pops: I dont know, but we made it this far and a guy never quits.

Russell: You're right. Thanks, Pops. No matter where we end up, well be lifting a jug in your honor.

(Pops and the guys look up as they're almost out. Pops finally comes to and opens his eyes.)

Rigby: Hes awake! Give him some room!

Pops: Im back!

(Pops accidentally punches Rigby, then gets up and raises the jug over his head. The timer dings. Everybody cheers.)

All: POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS! POPS!

Paramedic: Somebody call the paramedics? Wheres the body?

Pops: No body here, just us guys.

Paramedic: Guy's Night?

All: Guy's Night!

(laughter)

Pops: (laughs) Im finally one of the guys!

Mordecai: (laughs) Yea-yuh!

(A camera shutter clicks. We zoom out to see a picture of Pops and Mordecai together placed in Pops' scrapbook. Pops, in his bed, closes the scrapbook and laughs.)

(Episode starts at the bank on a cloudy day at the bank)

Bank manager: Your safety-deposit box, sir.

Nikolai: Thank you.

Bank manager: Do you need anything else?

Nikolai: (turns around) a little breathing.

(The bank manager walks to a safety deposit dox and grabs a gun. When Nikolai hears the sound of the gun, he runs and kicks the bank manager.)

(Episode begins at West Anderson High School. Mordecai and Rigby are drving up to the front in the cart.)

Rigby: (looking at his program list) Alright, let's see now. Foreign language, check. Geology, check. All that's left is....Bam!

(We are shown the list. Rigby circles the final class.)

Rigby (continued): Gym class! Once I pass this, I'll finally be able to graduate. Besides, any bozo can pass gym.

Mordecai: Then why didn't you pass the first time?

Rigby: I dunno. High school was a long time ago.

(Cut to the school gym.)

Principal Dean: Alright, you little loafers. Listen up! Coach McCrackle will no longer be teaching here.

(The gym class mumbles amongst each other.)

Principal Dean (continued): He requested that I read this letter of resignation to you all. (clears throat) "Dear class, things are finally looking up for me. I have won the lottery. Now that I'm a rich man, I will never have to spend another second in that disgusting gym with your pimply, greasy faces ever again." It, uh, goes on like this fo a while. But anyway, we found a new substitute for the remainder of the school year.

Rigby: A substitute? This'll be easier than I thought. Hello, high school degree.

Principal Dean: So please welcome former student and 5-time volleyball champion, coach Francis Jablonski!

(The door opens, and Jablonski walks into the gym in slow motion. He looks to the class and forms a smile. Rigby gasps and we zoom in on him to a flashblack. Teenage Rigby is standing in the hallways carrying books as he see Jablonski running towards him with a volleyball.)

Jablonski: Body check!

Teenage Rigby: Jablonski, no-

(Jablonski shoulder bumps into Rigby, causing him to groan and drop a few books. Cut to the gym. Jablonski is practicing volleyball with 3 others.)

Jablonski: Set me up!

(He serves the ball. Pans out to show Rigby walking by. The balls hits him in the face.)

Teenage Rigby: Aargh! Jablonski!

(Cut to the school field. Teenage Mordecai and Rigby are standing by as Jablonski is doing donuts, covering them in mud.)

Teenage Rigby (continued): JABLONSKI!

(Jablonski laughs as he continues spinning donuts. Fades back to present.)

Rigby: (whispering) Jablonski...

Principal Dean: Well, Jablonski, I'll leave ya to it.

Jablonski: Listen up, you clowns.

(The gym class is shocked.)

Jablonski (contnued): Now that I'm running this show, things are going to be different around here. (blows whistle) Everyone, 20 laps! Let's go! Except for my little bro Aiden, who's already achieved peak physical fitness.

(The class gets off the bleaches and onto the court.)

Jablonski (continued): (scoffs) Look at this. I didn't know this school had a 10-year program.

Rigby: Look, Jablonski. High school was a long time ago. We both matured a lot since then. Let's bury the hatchet.

Jablonski: Huh! As if! You wanna fail my class like you failed at life?

Rigby: (scared) No, sir.

Jablonski: WELLTHEN GET MOVING!

(Rigby, Milton and the class run to the middle of the court, where they start doing jumping jacks.)

Jablonski (continued): ...58, 59, 60...

(Pan to Francis and his brother on the bleaches eating pizza.)

Jablonski (continued): Let's go! More jumps, less jacks!

(Cut to Rigby struggling to climb a rope in the gym. He reaches the top and falls off. Francis blows his whistle.)

Jablonski (continued): Get back on the rope, you Butterfingers! This ain't naptime!

(Cut to the gym class running across the field with the Jablonski brothers driving behind them.)

Jablonski (continued): Come on! Let's hustle! Only 3 miles left!

(Cyt to the gym class washing the Jablonksis' car.)

Jablonski (continued): That's right! Put your backs into it! I want the Jablonski mobile spotless before lunchtime.

Rigby: What does this have to do with gym class?

Jablonski: EVERYTHING! Now get scrubbing!

(Rigby growls. Cut to the door to Principal Dean's office.)

Principal Dean: Let me get this straight. You want me to fire Jablonski?

Rigby: Yes, Principal Dean.

Principal Dean: (sighs) I can't fire him, but I can talk to him on your behalf about the car thing.

Rigby: What?! No! Don't mention me! He'll only make things worse if he knows I told you.

Principal Dean: It'll be totally anonymous, don't worry about it. Your secret is safe with me.

(Cut to the school. The principal is on the gym court behind Jablonski.)

Jablonski: Alright now, before we begin, I have an announcement to make. Principal Dean just told me that someone here has a problem with my teaching.

Principal Dean: (to Rigby; whispering) Totally anonymous.

(Rigby gulps.)

Jablonski: Well guess what? That someone just earned you all extra laps!

(The class grumbles.)

Rigby: (sarcastically) Aw, man! I can't believe someone snitched!

(Jablonski blows his whistle, and everyone walks down to the court.)

Jablonski: Let's go! Get to it!

(Rigby whistles innocently as he goes down.)

Jablonski (continued): Hold it, Rigby. I got a special assignment for you. Aiden!

(Aiden comes into the gym with a bucket full of dishes.)

Jablonski (continued): You get to wash my dishes.

(Aiden sets down the bucket in front of Rigby, causing water to splash onto his face.)

Rigby: You can't do this! You're just a substitute!

Jablonski: I can do whatever I want. I know you ratted me out, Rigby. Good luck passing my class now. Might want to put some elbow grease into it. Some of that food has really kicked on there!

(He and Aiden walk away laughing. Rigby angrily gets started.)

Rigby: (mockingly) Might wanna put some elbow grease into it.

(Cut to that night at Pops' house. Rigby is lying on the sofa groaning. Mordecai walks in.)

Mordecai: Dude, what's the matter? Can't keep up with the high school kids?

Rigby: Worse. It's Jablonski! He's the new substitute for my gym class!

Mordecai: Whoa, he's a sub now? I thought he'd be in jail or something.

Rigby: (standing up) Aah! It's not fair! I've done everything to get my diploma! I fell down a cave hole, went all the way to China, just so some meat-head can fail me in gym class. It's all for nothing!

(Mordecai sits down.)

Mordecai: No, it's not. You just have to beat him at his own game.

Rigby: But I'm terrible at volleyball!

Mordecai: What was that other thing he was into? Food...Run?

Rigby: (gasps) Yeah.

(Cut to West Anderson High. In the locker room, Rigby is carrying a stack load of dirty gym clothes, knocking into other students on the way. He finally sets it down in front of Jablonski, who is checking his timer.)

Jablonski: These time are pathetic.

(Rigby sighs and goes back. Milton is screaming and running away from Aiden as he smacks him with a rug. Aiden stops next to his brother.)

Jablonski (continued): A+ work, Aiden. Man, I'm starving.

(As Rigby opens his locker, a surprised look appears on his face as he hears the conversation.)

Jablonski (continued): Do they still do 'Taco Tuesday' at the cafeteria?

Rigby: You could do 'Taco Tuesday', or you could go on a...

(He closes his locker.)

Rigby (continued): ...Food Run.

Jablonski: Food Run? I haven't played that since high school. The glory days.

Milton: W-What's Food Run?

Jablonski: Don't you know anything, Milton?! Food Run is a game where two team order takeout from the same place. They race to the restaurant and the first team back with the food wins. I've never lost in my life.

Rigby: Jablonski, I challenge you to Food Run! If I win, you have to give me a pass in Phys Ed! Hmm-hmm!

(The gym boys gasp.)

Milton: Rigby, no! 

(Jablonski shows a competitive smile.)

Jablonski: Alright. But if I win, you fail. And you gotta wash me and Aiden's dirty jock straps for the rest of the semester.

(Rigby gasps.)

Rigby: Y-You're on!

Jablonski: Tommorrow night at midnight. We'll run to the Cheezer's on the bad side of town. You're going to lose, Rigby. Once a loser, always a loser!

(He walks out of the locker room.)

Milton: Wha are you gonna do, Rigby?

Rigby: I'm gonna need some help.

(A montage begins. At the kitchen in Pops' house, Milton unfold a map on the table and marks a road path from the school to Cheezer's. He and the classmates are outside the house as they watch Rigby drive the cart to the house, Mordecai keeping record of time with his timer. They move out of the way as Rigby comes to a stop. He comes out and goes into the house. He comes out with a lunchbag and throws it, causing it to hit a classmate's face. Mordecai shakes his head at the time.  We are then shown the same classmate standing and holding the lunchbag as Rigby drives toward him. He circles around, trying to grab the lunchbag, but fails. In the kitchen, Milton is checking his timer. Rigby runs in and grabs the lunchbag from thr table. He goes back outside and drives off in the cart. He is heading toward Mordecai and a few classmates, who cheer him on. Just as he is going to make it, he blows a tire. They all grieve over the busted tire until one classmate spots someone coming. It is Don, Rigby's brother, who has brought his car. He hands Rigby the keys, and he sets off, but not before tossing the lunchbag behind, which Milton catches. Cut to night time at West Anderson High, where the Jablonski brothers, Principal Dean and the rest of the gym class are waiting. On Francis' watch, it is 11:59 p.m.)

Jablonski: I knew he wouldn't show. Probably past that little chicken's bedtime.

Aiden: Heh, he's probably all nestled up in his chicken coop.

Both: (laughing) Chicken.

(They continue laughing until they see someone drive up. Everyone is shocked, even the marshal girl who blow a bubble in her face. It is Rigby, with Mordecai, who parks up next to the mobile.)

Rigby: Evening, Jablosers.

(The two brothers approach them.)

Jablonski: Well, well, well. Two dweebs for the price of one. Where'd you get that ride, twerp?

(Rigby adjusts the mirror.)

Rigby: Borrowed it from my little bro, who's way cooler than your little bro.

Jablonski: Ugh, let's just get this over with!

(Team Rigby and Team Jablonski are in their vehicles. The marshal girl has her flag raised.)
Gum Girl: Alright. The first team to pick up their food and make it back to the front steps wins!

(Milton is at the steps, waving around.)

Gum Girl (continued): (laughs) Gentlemen, get ready to place your orders!

(Francis raises his phone, and Rigby raises his with confidence.)

Gum Girl (continued): On your mark, get set, GO!

(Split-screen; Rigby pushes one button while Francis dials the Cheezer's number. Transits to Francis' side, He listens for the pickup, but therr is only beeping.)

Jablonski: Ugh! It's busy?!

(Team Jablonski glares at Team Rigby, who have the early call.)

Mordecai: Hmm-hmm-hmm. Speed dial.

(Cut to Cheezer's, where a waitress and chef are working. The waitress receives the call.)

Waitress: Cheezer's.

(She enters Rigby's order.)

Waitress (continued): Yep. Mmm-hmm. Extra cheese...got it. Alright, see you soon. (to chef) We got a food run!

(Cut to Team Rigby.)

Rigby: Ok, let's go!

(Team Rigby drives off, leaving Team Jablonski behind. Francis get frustrated and hands the phone to Aiden.)

Jablonski: Forget it! I'm just ordering at the drive-thru!

(Team Jablonski drives off. As we see Team Rigby driving through the town, we are shown a sign that says 'Now Entering The Bad Part Of Town.)

Rigby: Hey, it's not so bad here.

(In car view; a dirty businessman is in their way. He turns and see the car.)

Dirty Businessman: Get off my property!

(Team Rigby screams. Rigby drives out of his way and into a garbage can, spewing it over and leaving the car stuck.)

Rigby: Aahh, no!

(We pan out and see Team Jablonski driving past them laughing, putting them in the lead.)

Jablonski: Keep your eyes on the road, Grandma!

(Aiden serves a volleyball in the air, which hits Rigby in the head.)

Rigby: JABLONSKI!

(Team Rigby pulls out and gets back on the road, starting to catch up to Team Jablonski. Cut to what appears to be a tracker, Jablonski's team still ahead and Rigby's team still catching up. Principal Dean has the tracker, and the class is watching closely.)

Principal Dean: Jablonski's almost there!

(The two teams are almost at Cheezer's. Team Jablonski turns toward the drive-thru. Team Rigby follows.)

Rigby: Aaah! He's pullin' the drive-thru move! That's so much quicker!

(Rigby decides to reverse into a parking space. He then jumps out and runs to the Cheezer's entrance. He reaches the counter, tired.)

Rigby: Pickup for Team Rigby!

(The Cheezer's guy is grilling the cheese sandwich for the pickup.)

Cheezer's Guy: Uh, it's almost ready.

(Pan to the drive-thru window, where Team Jablonski is waiting. Jablonski glares at Rigby, who glares back. The Cheezer's guy finally has Rigby's order in the bag. He goes to give it to Rigby, who takes it without question.)

Cheezer's Guy (continued): Sorry, it's my first day.

(Rigby throws the money in his face and runs out.)

Jablonski: Aw, c'mon!

(Rigby runs back toward the car; the Cheezer's guy is frantically trying to swipe Jablonski's card to confirm payment, his order prepared.)

Jablonski (continued): Just gimme my food!

Cheezer's Guy: It's my...It's my first day!

(Rigby finally jumps into the car with his food. He holds in out to Mordecai.)

Rigby: Hold this.

(Mordecai does so and Rigby steps on the gas pedal. They drive out the car park. At the drive thru, the Cheezer's guy give Jablonski his food.)

Jablonski: Finally! Let's go!

(Team Jablonski drives off. Mordecai is looking at the map.)

Rigby: What's the map say?

Mordecai: (pointing) Go up here! There's a shortcut!

(At a split road, Team Rigby takes the second path. Team Jablonski takes the first.)

Mordecai (continued): Look out!

(There are a bunch of hobos walking on the road in their way. Rigby swerves around them. A bunch of hobos are hanging around a fire bin. They notice the car approaching and run away as it knocks down the bin. It heads straight for a fence. Rigby screams and swerves to a ramp near the fence. Team Rigby screams as they go up the ramp and in the air, then land back down on the road next to Team Jablonski.)

Jablonski: Sauce me, bro.

(Aiden takes out the cheese sauce from the bag and gives it to his brother, who tears it open with his teeth and throws it over his shoulder, causing it to land directly on the windshield of Team Rigby's car. Rigby screams. Nine cats jump onto the car to start licking the sauce, further blocking the view. Rigby stands in the vehicle.)

Rigby: Shoo! Go away!

(The dirty hobo from before jumps onto the car, causing Rigby to fall back into his seat.)

Dirty Businessman: I SAID GET OFF MY PROPERTY!

(Team Rigby screams again. They try swerving to shake  everything off the windshield. The two teams are now leaving The Bad Part of Town. The school is just ahead.)

Jablonski: Aw, yeah! We're gonna win!

Team Jablonski: Jablonski! Jablonski! Jablonski!

(Team Rigby swerves into the side of Jablonski's car, causing them to both start rolling. They land back on wheels. The gym class move out of the way before they crash into the sidewalk. Jablonski comes out groaning, as does Rigby. We are shown a split screen of Rigby and Jablonski staring each other. Jablonski takes his food from Aiden, who appears unconscious. He makes a weak run for the steps before tumbling. Mordecai gives his food to Rigby who follows suit.)

Mordecai: Go beat Jablonski, dude!

(Rigby and Jablonski are heading to the finish. In distorted slow motion Rigby is power-walking, catching up to Jablonski and holding his arm. Jablonski is crawling all the way. When Rigby starts to pass him, he slaps Rigby down on his legs, tripping him.)

Principal Dean: (distorted) Beat him, Rigby! Beat him so you can finally get out of my school!

(Milton looks on with a drop of sweat running down his face. The two rival are crawling to the finish with the food in their hands, until Rigby finally pushes ahead. Jablonski stops crawling.)

Jablonski: (distorted) Noooooo!

(The scene is no longer distorted. Rigby plants his food on the front steps first, Jablonski a split second after. Which means...)

Milton: Team Rigby wins!

(The gym class cheers for Rigby.)

Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

(He raises his bag in victory and plants in back down. Jablonski sits on the steps in defeats as the class and Principal Dean runs to Rigby, still cheering. Aiden goes to his brother.)

Mordecai: You did it, dude!

(All eyes are on Jablonski, who starts crying. Aiden pats him on the shoulder. Rigby walks down to him.)

Jablonski: It's not fair! I used to be the king of this school, now I'm just a lame, old substitute teacher who can't even win at Food Run!

(He buries his face in his hands and continues crying.)

Rigby: Come on, man. High school was a long time ago. You gotta get past the glory days and move on with your life. Focus on the now!

Jablonski: (sniffling) You're right. I gotta say, I got mad respect for that response, and for you. So much respect that I'm gonna embroider your face onto my letterman's jacket!

Rigby: Oooh. No, that's cool. Uh, you just pass me in gym class.

Jablonski: You got it, bro!

(Jablonski uses a marker to check off "Gym". Everyone jumps into a freeze frame victory.)

All: Yeah!

(End of Gymblonski)

(The episode starts with Mordecai, Rigby, CJ and Eileen in Eileen's house, watching TV)

Woman: And voila! This cake looks so yummy and now, I'm going to eat the whole thing all by myself.

Rigby: Cake!

Mordecai: Want cake!

Mordecai and Rigby: Need cake!

CJ: Why don't we go get some cake?

Mordecai: Are you kidding? Do you know how crazy the cake prices are in this town?

Eileen: Ever since that bakery cartel moved in, they kept the prices up and the supply down.

Rigby: Darn bakers!

Farmer Jimmy: (voiceover on the TV) Fellow Americans, does ever happen to you?

Female Employee: It's Susan's birthday, everyone! Come on, let's sing!

Employees: Ha--

Male Employee: Aaaaaaaaarrrrggh!!!

Farmer Jimmy: (comes into the scene) Are you sick to death of this old birthday song?

Male Employee: Yes I am! (Punches his computer)

Farmer Jimmy: Well, boy, howdy, so am I! Hi, it's me, Farmer Jimmy, part-time turkey farmer and social advocate, but you already knew that. But what you may not know is that old birthday song offends my music sensibilities so deeply, I barely have words to describe it. That's why I'm holding a contest to write a new birthday song. Not only will the winner create history by finally overthrowing Happy Birthday, but you'll also get a year's supply of our farm-fresh birthday cakes.

Voice: Birthday cakes are not actually farm-fresh.

Farmer Jimmy: I'll see you at my farm, not singing that song, but your new one.

Mordecai: Dude, a year's supply of cake? We gotta write the next happy birthday song.

(Circle-wipe transition to Pops' House where Mordecai and Rigby are in Benson's office)

Mordecai: Can we get the next three days off from work?

Benson: Um, no.

Rigby: But, Benson, we have to go compete in a happy birthday song contest. If we don't write a song to replace Happy Birthday...

Benson: Wait, the song that wins this contest will replace Happy Birthday? You can go to the contest.

Mordecai and Rigby: Nice!

Benson: I'm counting on you guys to put that happy birthday song in its grave. I can't, I just...

(Scene changes to the guys writing their new happy birthday song while walking)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man.

(Muscle Man is doing some exercises on a tree branch)

Muscle Man: Three.

Mordecai: Will you listen to our new song and tell us what you think?

Muscle Man: (comes down from the tree branch) Por supuesto, bro.

Mordecai: Okay, so this is the first thing we came up with, so it may be a little rough still.

Muscle Man: Unnecessary information noted.

Mordecai: (to Rigby) Ready?

(Rigby nods, then as they start singing their new happy birthday song, a sound from leather workout boots is heard, and Muscle Man is touched by their new song)

Muscle Man: (sniffles) Okay, one: that sound was my new leather workout boots. Still breaking 'em in. And two: that song--I've never heard anything more beautiful.

(Scene cuts to the road where Mordecai, Rigby, CJ and Eileen driving to Farmer Jimmy's Turkey Farm)

Mordecai: I can't believe we nailed in the new song on the first try.

Rigby: I can believe it. We've been totally nailing life recently.

Eileen: So, how far away is this farm exactly.

Mordecai: Looks like it's gonna take us all night.

Rigby: I'm getting hungry-y-y!

CJ: There should be a diner coming up. We could stop there.

Mordecai: Alright.

(Scene cuts to a diner at night, and inside, Rigby peers into a dessert display case)

Rigby: Pie, pie, ca-a-a-ake! "$50 a slice"?!

Cake Cartel: Quit your gasping, it's a fair price.

(Rigby walks back to the guys at a table)

Eileen: No dessert?

Rigby: No thanks to the cake cartel.

Eileen: I can't decide between sherbet or sherbert.

(Four employees clap to the birthday song while they give a cupcake with a candle on it to a table next to their table where a mom and her son is)

Diner Employees: It's your birthday, birthday, happy happy...

Son: Augh! Make it stop!

Mother: But it's your birthday, sweetie.

Son: I don't want it to be my birthday if they're gonna sing that song! (starts crying as they continue to sing the song)

Mother: Can't somebody do something?

CJ: That poor kid.

Eileen: Augh! Are all birthday songs terrible?

Mordecai: Dude.

(Rigby nods, then they go to the table and makes the employees stop)

Mordecai: Holster them hand claps, bro.

(As they start singing their new happy birthday song, a sound from a vacuum cleaner and dishes breaking are heard, and the boy is touched by their new song)

Diner Employee: That song was so cool! Did you guys write that?

Mordecai: Yeah. We're entering it in this birthday song contest thing.

(The cake cartel is suspicious at this and we cut to her in a telephone booth where she dials a number. Cut to an anonymous person, sitting on his chair inside his mansion, who answers the number)

Anonymous: Yes? What?! A contest?! No, no, no, thank you for letting me know.

(They ended their calls as the cake cartel walls out of the phone booth and watches them continue to drive to the farm. Circle-wipe transitions to morning where a turkey is standing on a pole gobbling and flapping its feathers. We see the guys sleeping, then they wake up)

Mordecai: We made it!

Farmer Jimmy: Well, this is quite a turnout! Welcome all to the first, and last, Farmer Jimmy Birthday Song Competition!

(The audience cheers)

Farmer Jimmy: Are you folks ready for a new birthday song?

(The audience cheer again)

Farmer Jimmy: A song to replace the most overused song of all time, one that takes a pitiful day of celebration and turns it into the worst day of your life?

(The audience murmur)

Farmer Jimmy: Good, then! Each of our contestants will perform a new birthday song, and our judges will rate them one through ten with a highest possible total of 30 lit candles. To clarify...

Farmer Jimmy: ...30 candles, good. Zero candles, bad. And there are no trick candles. I've checked. In conclusion, the contestant with the best score will receive a year's supply of farm fresh cakes! May the best new birthday song win! (Blows a party favor)

Sunshine: It's nice to enjoy the presence of your friends. Nice to enjoy sweet treats.

Sheena: Baked a real fine cake, it's gonna make you shake. Baked a real...

Darkness: As we melt away by candlelight

(One judge blows 3 candles)

Colette: And have a haaaaaaaaaappy...

Judy: So I can sing you a little song about the day you came out of your mom

Young Gamer: Mom, get off the stage!

(The two judges blow the candles and another judge push the cake as 10 candles)

Axelrod: Presents are coming! B-b-b-b-b-better roll up your sleeves, sleeves, sleeves S-s-s-s...

(The judge blows 2 candles)

Colette: Haaaaaaaaaappy Biirthday, oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

(She sheds a tear as she drops the microphone and Axelrod comes back on the stage and grabs it to give another shot and she runs away)

Axelrod: And just when you think you're safe, it's your birthday again, and again, and again, and again, and again

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw.

Axelrod: Agagagagagaga! Party hard! Lalalalalalalala!

(The judges blow the candles and the scoreboard shows them their scores)

Farmer Jimmy: Twenty-eight! Now that was a good birthday! Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm! That's a tough number to beat and only one song left on our competition. Please welcome last year's Thanksgiving song winners, Mordecai and Rigby!

(They walk on the stage)

CJ: Whoooo!

(The audience cheers as Eileen puts a smiley face)

Mordecai: Well, this is just our little version of Happy Birthday.

(As they are about to sing, a cloud of smoke appears out of nowhere, making them cough)

Farmer Jimmy: Oh, no! No, no!

(A cake humanoid appears out of the smoke)

Happy Birthday: Oh, I'm sorry! Did somebody say my name?

Farmer Jimmy: Happy Birthday himself!

Happy Birthday: The guest of honor is here! (Laughs and he goes to a chocolate cake) Ooh! Quite the party!  (He picks the frosting with his finger and eats it) I've had better.

Farmer Jimmy: (offscreen) Hey, stop that!

Happy Bitthday: Stop what?

Farmer Jimmy: (runs up to him) Happy Birthday, you scoundrel! You're ruining the contest! Get off of my stage!

Happy Birthday: Or what? You're not gonna invite me to your birthday party?

(He laughs and shoots icing at Farmer Jimmy from his armpit)

Mordecai: Dude, we were just about to sing our song!

Rigby: Yeah, what you just did was not cool!

Happy Birthday: Oh, you wanna know what's not cool? Writing a new birthday song is what's not cool! America loves Happy Birthday! You love Happy Birthday, Mordecai and Rigby!

Mordecai: That's not true! Happy Birthday is a tired, old song, and the people want something new. Isn't that right, America?!

(The audience and Farmer Jimmy cheer)

Happy Birthday: Shut your cake-hole, America! You'll never win the birthday song contest when you're up against Happy Birthday! Happy birthday to you.

Farmer Jimmy: No, no!

Happy Birthday: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear everyone!

(He shoots out confetti, which makes the audience to be entranced)

Happy Birthday: Happy birthday to you.

Rigby: So, what does that--

Happy Birthday: Ah! (He makes the audience sing the song)

Audience: Happy birthday to you.

Happy Bithday: Yes! (Laughs)

Audience: Happy birthday to you.

Happy Birthday: Yeah, happy birthday to you!

Audience and Happy Birthday: Happy birthday dear...

(Everyone says their names)

Happy Birthday: That's right, say their names!

Audience and Happy Birthday: Happy birthday to you!

(He laughs as the audience starts to leave)

Happy Birthday: You'll never overthrow my song! They'll be no birthdays without it! (Laughs)

Farmer Jimmy: Then all is lost. I guess you can't solve every problem with an overly complicated farm-themed song contest. Guess I'll have to throw away that year's supply of cake, but you already knew that.

Mordecai and Rigby: Wait! Woah, woah woah!

Mordecai: Give us the chance to sing our song.

(They run to the front of the stage)

Happy Birthday: Goodbye! Thanks for coming!

(They start to sing their new song)

(Song: Celebratin' Your Birthday)

Mordecai and Rigby: Today's gonna be a-ok, 'Cause we're celebratin' your birthday! Happy birthday, CJ, Celebratin' your birthday!

Happy Birthday: What are you doing?!

Mordecai and Rigby: Today's gonna be a-ok, 'Cause we're celebratin' your birthday! Happy birthday,

Randall: Randall

Mordecai and Rigby: Celebratin' your birthday!

Audience Member #1: That sounds simple and fresh.

Audience Member #2: Hey, that's pretty catchy.

(The audience comes back and join in)

Mordecai, Rigby, CJ , Eileen, Randall and Woman: Today's gonna be a-ok, 'Cause we're celebratin' your birthday!

Happy Birthday: No, stop it!

Mordecai, Rigby, CJ , Eileen, Randall, Woman and Audience: Happy birthday, everyone, Celebratin' your birthday! Today's gonna be a-ok, 'Cause we're celebratin' your birthday!

(Happy Birthday groans and goes to an organ and starts playing it)

(Mordecai, Rigby and Audience: Happy birthday, everyone, Celebratin' your birthday!)

Happy Birthday: Happy birthday to you. Come on!

Farmer Jimmy: Arrrggh!!!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Audience: Today's gonna be a-ok, 'Cause we're celebratin' your birthday!)

Happy Birthday: Happy birthday to you...

(Farmer Jimmy runs to Happy Birthday and pushes him off the organ)

Farmer Jimmy: Get off of my stage!

(He plays the organ to the tune of the song)

Mordecai, Rigby and Audience: Happy birthday, everyone, Celebratin' your birthday! Today's gonna be a-ok, 'Cause we're celebratin' your birthday! Happy birthday, everyone, Celebratin' your birthday! Today's gonna be a-ok, 'Cause we're celebratin' your birthday! Happy birthday, everyone, Celebratin' your birthday!

(The judges push their cakes, giving them their perfect score)

Farmer Jimmy: 30 candles! A perfect score! Mordecai and Rigby are the winners!

(The audience cheers)

Happy Birthday: Fine. Who needs you anyways? You see how you like the limelight, the collecting of all those royalties. And just wait until people start getting sick of your song, then you'll see how it feels! And then you'll all come crawling back, back to good ol' Happy Birthday! (Laughs as he leaves the stage and gets into his car) Later, losers! (He tries to turn in his engine until its finally on and he drives off) Later, losers!

Eileen: Wow! Great job guys!

CJ: Yeah, you wiped the floor with that creepy cake.

Mordecai: It was nothing.

Rigby: No biggie.

Farmer Jimmy: Well, congratulations, boys. You've certainly earned that year's supply of cakes.

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah-uh!

Farmer Jimmy: You'll have to go over some details with my lawyer, but you already knew that. (Clicks his tongue and leaves as his lawyer arrives)

Lawyer: Just sign here to claim your cake and acknowledge that your song will probably never replace the original Happy Birthday song.

(They sign the contract)

Lawyer: Bring in the lump sum!

Mordecai: Lump sum?

(A truck backs up and drops the cakes on Mordecai and Rigby. Eileen giggles.)

CJ: Well, you guys wanted cake.

Mordecai and Rigby: Free cake!

(Episode ends)

Mordecai: [groans] What now? Look, we're working. See.

Rigby: Yeah, we're never gonna get done if you keep checking up on us.

Benson: It's Pay day, fellas.

Mordecai: Yeah-yuh!

Rigby: My favorite day of the every other week!

Benson: [hands Mordecai and Rigby each a bag of change] Here. [Mordecai groans] What, you don't like getting paid?

Mordecai: No, I'm just getting tired of the old sandwich-baggie full of coins. Why can't we get a check like normal people? Skips gets checks.

Benson: Skips has a bank account and a 401k.

Mordecai: Well, at least give us the coins in an envelope or something more respectable, 'cause this is degrading. [Benson drives away] I need to get out of here. [Cut to Mordecai and Rigby walking to the coffee shop] What's his deal? He doesn't respect us at all!

Rigby: Yeah, well that's his problem, right? We're respectable people.

[Mordecai and Rigby get knocked over by two skateboarders]

Kid 1: Outta the way!

Kid 2: Losers!

Mordecai: What the heck, man? Watch it! [Cut to the coffee shop] See man, it's not just Benson, people just don't respect us.

Rigby: Well, we could buy people's respect.

Mordecai: Nah, too expensive. People respect people who are good at things. [Pan to crowd cheering around an arcade game. Mordecai and Rigby walk up to Margaret] Margaret, what's going on?

Margaret: The manager installed this new arcade game to keep the customers around. These kids are amazing at it, you should see 'em.

Mordecai: Dude, it's those kids! (to the kids) Hey, hey you!

Kid 2: What?

Mordecai: When you knock people over, you have to say you're sorry. You guys need to learn some respect.

Kid 1: Respect our butts.

Rigby: No, you respect our butts!

Margaret: What are you guys doing?

Mordecai: Those kids practically killed us with their skateboards outside.

Margaret: So? They're kids. What are you going to do, beat them up or something?

Mordecai: No, but I am gonna kick their butts at this video game. [puts coin on the arcade game] Bam! I got next.

Kid 2: Nice baggie, must've been sad when you break open your piggy bank.

Kids: Seven-hundred thousand/700,0000!

Kid 2: [putting name on high score list] TRD, turd. [laughs] Nice.

Kids: [high-five] Yeah-yuh!

Kid 2: Beat that, gramps.

Mordecai: Gramps? I'm in my 20s.

Kid 1: Yeah, 1920s. [laughs]

Mordecai: Just move. [sits in front of the arcade game, cracks knuckles and starts playing]

Rigby: How do you get negative points? How is that even possible?

Mordecai: It was the first time I ever played that stupid game. Give me a break.

Rigby: I'm just saying, you made us look like chumps, man.

Mordecai: Look at 'em.

Manager: You guys really handed it to those losers.

Margaret: [walks over with plate of donuts] Free donuts for the champs!

Kid 2: All right, we're outta here.

Margaret: [walking away] Weren't they amazing? I can't believe we were so enthralled by a video game, but we were.

Mordecai: I told you people respect you when you're good at something. And we're gonna get the respect we deserve by getting good at that game. [Mordecai and Rigby start playing the game] Okay, Broken Bonez.

Rigby: So are you trying to get broken bones?

Mordecai: Dude, c'mon, no, you just gotta go off these jumps and land without breaking your bones.

Rigby: Alright, I think I got it. Here, gimme a shot. [mindlessly taps and turns]

Mordecai: Woah, how'd you do that?

Rigby: I dunno, that's what those kids were doing. Here, you do the joystick and I'll do the buttons. Just go crazy when we're in the air.

Mordecai: Wow, another 500! Aww sweet!

Jack Farley: Aww, well not bad, not bad. You guys got some skill.

Mordecai: Some? What do you mean some?

[Jack Farley plays the game, Mordecai and Rigby play the game, Jack Farley plays the game again]

Jack Farley: C'mon, Jack Farley! [groans] Dang it! [Screen shows 5 broken bonez!] Well, I gotta hand it to you guys. You play better than you look.

Rigby: Okay?

Mordecai: Thanks.

Jack Farley: Stop by the office sometime if you wanna hang. [hands Mordecai a card] No charge. [cellphone rings] Yeah, Jack Farley? No! I said cell two, two!

Rigby: What was that all about?

Mordecai: [gasps] Respect!

Rigby: Let's get some more.

Benson: (over walkie talkie) Mordecai, Rigby, come in.

Mordecai: Aww, man, it's Benson. [reaches for walkie talkie] Yeah, uh, hey Benson. What's up?

Benson: (over walkie talkie) I need you guys to clean the bathrooms back at the house ASAP.

Mordecai: Uh, we're on our lunch break.

Benson: Look, if you guys aren't back in two minutes, you're fired!

Rigby: Gimme that! [snatches walkie talkie] We deserve more respect than this, Benson. Maybe when you realize that we'll come back to work. [throws wakie talkie in the bin]

Benson: (over walkie talkie) Rigby, Mordecai!

Mordecai and Rigby: Respect!

Kid 1: Oh look, if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. negative points. Guess we'll have to beat you two losers again.

Mordecai: Well, why don't you two come over here and try, then?

Kid 2: You got yourselves a rematch.

Kids: Aww, man!

Kid 2: All right, you guys are good.

Mordecai: Thanks.

Kid 1: Whoa, you guys are really good! You're close to beating the high score!

Mordecai: Whoa, we are?

[Mordecai and Rigby's score: 950,000. High score: 1,275,640]

Jack Farley: Wait, who holds the high score?

Dude: Some dude named GBF, but it's not just a high score, it's the world record.

Jack Farley: Thanks, now I can follow along and feel invested. Go for it, guys!

Mordecai: Yeah!

GBF: So you've broken the world record, have you?

Mordecai: Yeah, who's asking?

GBF: Me. [turns around]

Rigby: [makes sound of disgust] It's a giant bearded face!

Mordecai & Rigby: [gasp] GBF!

GBF: Yeah, I'm GBF all right, but it stands for Garrett Bobby Ferguson, not Giant Bearded Face.

Rigby: You're not mad at us for breaking your world record, are you?

GBF: It's no big deal. Not like it's the universe record or anything important.

Mordecai & Rigby: The Universe record?

GBF: It's the highest score in the whole universe, 1,279,001. Now who holds that record again? Oh yeah, me! [Crowd runs up to GBF and strokes his beard] Yes, go ahead, stroke the beard of Garrett Bobby Ferguson.

Mordecai: Hey, Giant Beard-o Face!

GBF: I told you that's not my name!

Mordecai: Look, we're gonna settle this right now. Us versus you in a head to head match.

GBF: Fine. One game for the universe record. Winner gets all the respect. [sprouts arms and legs] [Mordecai and Rigby make a sound of disgust] Let's play.

Mordecai: Dude, why're you crying, dude?

GBF: Please, please just let me win.

Mordecai: Dude, what are you talking about?

GBF: I've devoted my entire life to Broken Bonez. I played so much my wife left me.

Mordecai: So you're asking us to throw the game?

GBF: Please, the universe record is all I have.

Mordecai: What do you think, man?

Rigby: No way! Nobody's gonna respect us if we wuss out now.

Mordecai: It's not wussing out, man. It's called doing the right thing.

Rigby: Fine.

Mordecai: Okay dude, we'll let you have it.

[Mordecai and Rigby let go, screen shows 'Player 1: 1,250,000']

GBF: Thank you so much! [laughs evilly] Thank you for being so dumb.

Mordecai & Rigby: What?

GBF: I didn't devote my life to this cruddy game, it's just a hobby.

Mordecai: But what about your wife?

GBF:  [scoffs] Never had one. You can't tie GBF down.

Rigby: You can't do that, that's cheating!

GBF: Universe rules, baby. There are no rules. [Crowd boo] Oh, boo yourselves! I'm Garrett Bobby Ferguson.

Mordecai: Aww, this blows! We gotta do something before he beats our score.

Rigby: No rules, right? Mess up, c'mon, mess up!

Mordecai: You know you want some broken bones.

Rigby: Broken bones!

Mordecai & Rigby: Broken bones!

GBF: [laughs] It doesn't matter, I've already beat your score and taken the title and I'm never coming back.

Jack Farley: Wait, the game's still going!

Mordecai: Huh?

GBF: No, it can't be!

Mordecai: C'mon, c'mon!

Mordecai: Get off!

GBF: Ow! My Chin!

Mordecai & Rigby: Yeah!

GBF: NOOOOOOOOO-- [explodes and covers everyone in a white brain goo]

[Crowd cheers and surrounds Mordecai and Rigby]

Jack Farley: Great job, you did it!

Mordecai: Oh, hey Benson, what're you doing here?

Benson: I thought about what you guys said earlier and so I've come down to give you those checks you wanted.

Mordecai & Rigby: Oh, wow, thanks. [reach for the checks]

Benson: [pulls checks away] But now that I'm covered in brain goo, I've realized my mistake. (goes red) [starts tearing up checks] You wanna waste your lives playing video games, then fine! I respect your decision! Just don't ever do it on my time ever again!

Mordecai: I can respect that.

Rigby: Yeah, that's cool.

(Mordecai and Rigby are playing Karate Choppers. The swordsmen on the game both destroy enemies, as a popup appears on the screen)

Announcer: Double death combo!

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAAA! Double death combo!

Benson: Hey guys, listen. When you've got a minute, I need you to take a look at these.

Mordecai: Sure, Benson. [sees front cover: it reads "Benson's House Rules"] Oh, the house rules. Thanks, but we already have these.

Benson: Uh, no you don't, cause I've added a few new ones in there, and I'm gonna need you to sign off on them, okay? [walks off]

Rigby: Aw, man, more rules? He's gotta be joking!

Mordecai: Alright, let's see. Rule #114: No feet on the table. [M&R's feet are on the table, then they take them off, moaning] Rule #115: No food on the table. [food is seen on the table, so they knock it all off]

Rigby: Fine!

Mordecai: Rule #116: No food on the floor.

Rigby: WHAT?! That's going WAY too far! [growls while straining himself to lift the table] Come on, man, help me flip the table!

Mordecai: No, dude, just chill out. There's only one more new rule left.

Rigby: What is it?

Mordecai: No video games?!

Rigby: Are you nuts?!

Benson: [holding up rule] Rule #47: No yelling!

Rigby: You can't take video games away from us, man. What're we supposed to do?

Benson: Work. You're supposed to work.

Mordecai: You know what? We're sick of all your rules! No prank calls, no rock-paper-scissors, no punchies, no unicorns? What does that even mean?

Rigby: These rules are all totally random, Benson, and they're all aimed at us!

Benson: That's not true. #68: No harpsichord playing after 10 PM.

Rigby: I actually kind of like that one.

Mordecai: Yeah, but that's the only good one in there. The rest of them are terrible!

Benson: Look, I'm doing you a favor. Life without rules is chaos.

Mordecai: Fine. But we're only signing off on the rules we like.

Rigby: Yeah, like the harpsichord one!

Benson: It doesn't work that way! If you can't agree to live by all the house rules, then you can't live in this house!

Mordecai: Well then, we won't live in this house.

Rigby: Yeah, cause your rules are whack!

Mordecai: We'll show you. [zoom in] We're not gonna live with any rules at all.

Announcer: Double death combo!

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAAA!

Mordecai: Heheh. Dude, we should have moved out a long time ago. I feel like I just got out of prison.

Rigby: That's 'cause Benson built a rule prison around us. But we busted out, and now we can do whatever we want!

Mordecai and Rigby: [rapping] Rules are for fools! Rules are for fools! Save your stupid rulin' for fools that need some schoolin'!

Mordecai: Muscle Man, what are you doing?!

Muscle Man: My job, bro. Read it and weep, ladies. [holds up Rule #118: No overnight camping]

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what? Come on!

Muscle Man: While I sympathyze with your quest to live free of the man's rules, this guy's still gotta put food on the table.

Mordecai: Fine! But you didn't have to ruin our campsite!

Muscle Man: Yes I did.

Mordecai: Yes! She's still here. [waves into building. Margaret notices] Hey!

Margaret: [opens door] Hi guys!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hey, Margaret.

Margaret: Hey, is it true? Did you really move out of the house?

Rigby: Yeah, we did! 'cause Benson got all rulesy!

Mordecai: We had no choice. It was either leave or live with some other dude with rules.

Margaret: Wow, Mordecai! I didn't know you were such a rebel.

Mordecai: Yep. You know me. Total rebel. [they both laugh]

Margaret: Well, good night. [almost closes door, but Mordecai stops the action with his foot]

Mordecai: Actually, we don't have anywhere to sleep, so we were hoping you would let us camp out here tonight.

Margaret: I wish I could, but, my manager has a rule about that kind of thing. [pans over to guy in white shirt. He sticks a paper to the window that reads, "get lost campers"] Sorry, guys.

Mordecai: It's cool. I'm sure we can find some place to crash that isn't so big on rules. Later!

Mordecai: Dude, this is getting intense.

Rigby: [moans] No! More! RUUUUULES! [zoom out before an earthquake, followed by a gust, occurs, followed by a mysterious laugh]

No Rules Man: Did somebody say... [comes out from shadows] ...rules?

Rigby: Oh, great. Who are you, the alley rules guy?

No Rules Man: Who am I? I'm whoever I want to be. Wanna know why? 'cause I don't believe in rules that tell me otherwise.

Mordecai: Whoa.

Rigby: That's pretty cool.

No Rules Man: You better believe it's pretty cool. So what's your guys' story? You all free to do whatever you want?

Mordecai: We wish.

Rigby: Yeah, we have this lame boss Benson that tells us to-

No Rules Man: Boss? What's that?

Mordecai: It's a-

No Rules Man: (interrupts Mordecai's speech) Yeah, I know what a boss is. I was just making a point. Bosses are nothing but fools with rules.

Rigby: Oh yeah, rules for fools.

No Rules Man: That's right! It makes so much sense in rhymes.

Rigby: Whoa, that's crazy!

No Rules Man: You guys seem pretty cool, so I'll let you in on a little secret. [whispers] I know of a place where rules don't exist.

Rigby: No way! Are you serious?

No Rules Man: Shhhhhhhhhhhh. [signals M&R to follow him as he backs up to a box filled with garbage bags. He almost jumps in before...]

Mordecai: A box of trash? Are you joking?

No Rules Man: Do I look like I'm joking? [jumps in]

Mordecai: Uh, I don't know about this, dude.

Rigby: Well, I practically sleep in a pile of garbage at home anyways, so this isn't really that different for me.

Mordecai: Sweet! [looks over and sees a punchie parade, and then notices Rigby and the No Rules Man are playing Karate Choppers]

Rigby and No Rules Man: WHOAAAAA! Double death combo!

Mordecai: Aw, you guys have Karate Choppers down here? [walks up to couch and sits, feet on the floor]

No Rules Man: Go ahead. Put your feet up.

Mordecai: Aw, yeah-yuh! [does so] Can I get next game?

No Rules Man: No need, bro. [controller appears right in Mordecai's hands. Mordecai, Rigby and the No Rules Man are now playing three-player mode]

Mordecai and Rigby: Three-player Karate Choppers! [pick up pizza and high-five eachother with the pizzas] Oh, yeah-yuh!

No Rules Man: Rockin'. [phone is ringing] Would you mind getting that?

Mordecai: Hello?

Prank Caller: Loser says what!

Mordecai: Who is this?

Prank Caller: Loser says what!

Mordecai: I know what you're trying to do. I'm not going to say "what."

Prank Caller: [laughs] You're a loser! You loserhead! I hate you!

Mordecai: [hangs phone] Dude, I think someone just prank called us.

No Rules Man: Ah, yeah. It was probably Kevin. [points to phone booth. Kevin laughs hysterically before the phone booth blasts off like a rocket]

Rigby: Oh man, you guys can make prank calls down here?

No Rules Man: You still don't get it, don't you? Down here, you can do... [floats up to air] ...whatever you want.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoaaaaaaaahhhhhh. [they, too, float up to the air]

Mordecai: Whoa-oa!

No Rules Man: Yeah man, no rules of gravity.

Rigby: Dude, in Benson's face! Living without rules is awesome!

Mordecai: Yeah it is!

[M&R laugh]

Mordecai and Rigby: No rules! No rules! No rules! No rules! [No Rules Man laughs]

No Rules Man: That's right, no rules at all. [points] Hey, look over there! [M&R look off in distance, then, the No Rules Man punches Mordecai]

Mordecai: What the heck, man?

Rigby: Dude! He just took your wallet! [No Rules Man has wallet]

Mordecai: Dude, give it back!

No Rules Man: Why? There's no rule that says I can't take other people's stuff.

Old Mordecai: He's right, dudes. [Mordecai & Rigby recoil in fear at seeing the Old Mordecai] Oh, man! I used to be so cool-looking! [pats Mordecai's hair] Wow, you're totally going to miss that. You know what else you're going to miss? [points to Rigby] That guy. Enjoy him while you got him, you know what I'm saying?

Rigby: What does that mean?

Old Mordecai: Oh, uh, nothing, dude.

Mordecai: Dude! How is this even happening?

No Rules Man: Because there's no rule that says it can't! From your future to your past, anyone can join the party.

Mordecai: Unicorns?!

Rigby: They're supposed to be dead!

Unicorn 1: Check it, bros! It's those two jerkbags that blew us up!

Mordecai: You gotta listen to us, man! These guys are seriously bad news! You gotta get rid of them!

No Rules Man: Did you just tell me what to do?! You just told me what to do! [to unicorns] Hey, they just told me what to do!

Unicorn 1: They're telling people what do to?!

Unicorn 2: Oh, no way, bro! Get 'em!

Rigby: Hey, you gotta get us outta here, man!

No Rules Man: This guy ain't gotta do jack, amigo! I can't believe how lame you guys turned out! I thought you were cool! [everyone else comes up]

Rigby: I hate to admit this, but I miss Benson and his stupid rules!

Mordecai: Wait! Yo! No Rules Guy! You do have at least one rule down here. You have a rule against rules.

No Rules Man: There's no rule against rules.

Mordecai: That's all I needed to hear. [raises hand to make rule book appear in midair]

Unicorns: Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! [as the unicorns dirve up, Mordecai flips through the book]

Mordecai: Rule #37: No unicorns! [unicorns explode into neon blue goo] Rule #72: No rock-paper-scissors! [giant hand explodes] No punchies! [the punchie-playing punks blow up off screen]

Rigby: And no prank calls! [Kevin explodes into neon blue goo before the phonebooth vanishes as well]

No Rules Man: Stop! Just stop it! You guys have no idea what-

Rigby: AAAAAGGGHHH! [tackles No Rules Man, then, Mordecai jumps in and pins him to the ground]

Mordecai: Show us the way out of here!

No Rules Man: There's no rule that says I have to!

Mordecai: There's also no rule that says I can't point this laser pointer in your only good eye! [prepares to do it]

No Rules Man: Okay, okay! I'll take you out!

Mordecai: There. We signed off on all your rules, Benson.

Benson: Well, well, well. Wasn't so easy living without rules, was it? [opens book] Wait a minute. One of these rules is missing.

Rigby: Oh, no. Which one?

Benson: I don't know, there's over a hundred of these things!

Mordecai: Well, then, how do you know it's missing?

Benson: Because somebody RIPPED IT OUT!!

Mordecai: That's crazy. I wonder which one it is.

No Rules Man: Hmph. Hmph. I don't need those guys, I can play video games by myself. [The ripped page falls onto his lap. It is Rule #117: No Video Games] NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

(Episode starts at the Coffee Shop and Mordecai and Rigby are watching a movie trailer)

Announcer: Blood. (Shows a zombie biting someone's arm, with blood coming out) Guts. (Shows a zombie taking a guy's guts out of his body. The guy screams.) Dinner. (Shows a policeman in a chair. A bunch of arms holding forks and knives bust through the wall. The policeman screams) Zombie Dinner Party.

Mordecai: That looks awesome.

Rigby: I'm glad you said that, because I got us... BAM!!! (throws 2 tickets on the table) 2 tickets for opening night!

Mordecai: Ooh, I kind of already got 2 tickets for Pajama Sisters 2.

Rigby: What? Why? That's just some chick flick. And not even the good kind! I saw the preview. They're just gonna sit around talking about their feelings, fully clothed.

Mordecai: No, dude. I got these tickets for me and Margaret. I'm finally gonna try and ask her out.

Rigby: Aw, what? But it's opening night! Do you know how hard it was to get these tickets?

Margaret: Hey, guys, your food is almost ready. Sorry for the hold-up.

Mordecai: Oh, hey, Margaret. Um, I was wondering, uh, would you, uh, like to, uh, you know, uh...

Rigby: You're gonna have to excuse Mordecai here. He has a hard time trying to "espresso" himself.

Margaret: (laughs) Good one, Rigby. I'll be right back with your food, guys.

Rigby: Dude, did you see how hard Margaret laughed at me?

Mordecai: That wasn't funny.

Rigby: Yes it was. Man, what's your problem?

Margaret: Here you go, guys. (puts two salads down on the table)

Rigby: Salad? Where's my French dip?

Margaret: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I messed up, let me take it back.

Rigby: Everything okay, Margaret? You seem like you've got a "full plate".

Margaret: (laughs) Yeah! I'm just a little stressed 'cause I'm moving out of my place today.

Mordecai: I can help you.

Margaret: Really? Thanks, Mordecai!

Rigby: Hey, Margaret, I can help you move too.

Margaret: Oh, perfect! Do you guys mind coming by my place in an hour?

Rigby: Oh, we don't mind. It'll be a "moving" experience for all of us.

Margaret: (laughs) Rigby!

(Mordecai kicks Rigby under the table)

Rigby: Ow! What?

Mordecai: Nothing.

Rigby: Wait a minute... you're jealous.

Mordecai: What? No I'm not.

Rigby: Dude, you're just jealous 'cause I made her laugh and all you do is sit like this: Uh, uh, uh...

Mordecai: Whatever. Just stay out of my way when I'm helping her move.

(Scene changes to outside Margaret's apartment, where Mordecai and Rigby are helping her put boxes into a truck)

Margaret: Alright, guys, we're almost done.

(Mordecai puts a box into the truck)

Mordecai: Do it. Just do it. Hey, Margaret. Um, I've been meaning to ask you, uh, do you want to, uh, have me pick up that box?

Margaret: Oh, yeah, thanks! This is the last one, but be careful because it's really...(sees Mordecai trying to pick it up)...heavy. Uh, do you need help with that?

Mordecai: It's cool. I got it. (carries the box over to the truck)

Rigby: (standing in a box) Hey, Margaret. Briefs or (pulls the box up) boxers?

Margaret: (laughs) You're so funny, Rigby. Okay, gotta go talk to the manager. I'll be right back. (walks away)

Mordecai: Hey, Rigby. You better leave, dude. You're ruining my chances with Margaret.

Rigby: What? You haven't even made a move on her yet. You're gonna end up seeing Zombie Dinner Party with me anyway.

Mordecai: No, I'm not. Quit screwing this up for me.

Rigby: You're just jealous that I can talk to chicks, and you can't!

(They see Margaret walking back towards them)

Rigby: You gonna ask her out or what?

Margaret: Hey, guys. Ready to call it a day?

Mordecai: Margaret! Uh, just wanted to ask you if you want to, uh, I mean you obviously don't have to but, uh...

Rigby: Margaret, wanna see something cool? BAM! (shows tickets) Two tickets for the Zombie Dinner Party premiere! Wanna go with me tonight?

Margaret: You actually got tickets? Yeah, I'll totally go with you tonight! Mordecai, you gotta come too!

Rigby: Mordecai can't come because I only got two tickets!

Margaret: Aw, maybe next time?

Mordecai: No. No, it's cool. You guys have a good time.

Margaret: Okay. I'll see you at 8, Rigby! (gets into the truck)

Mordecai: Alright, dude, I'll go to the movie with you. Just call it off with her.

Rigby: Pfft, yeah, right. I'm not going with you. You had your chance, and you blew it! You blew it!

Mordecai: Agh! Come on, dude, just give me another chance.

Rigby: Ok, I give you another chance, if you admit that you're jealous.

Mordecai: No, I'm not jealous.

Rigby: Then I guess I'm still going out with Margaret. Ohhhhhhhhh! You blew it again, you blew it again!

(Goes to next scene where Rigby is on the computer at the park)

Rigby: Mordecai, check this out.

Mordecai: What?

(Shows Mordecai the trailer for "Pajama Sisters 2")

Girl in trailer: Haha, ahh. Why doesn't he like me? (sobs)

(Comments on the computer saying that the movie sucks)

Rigby: Looks like Pajama Sisters 2 is bombing, but it's doing better than you did with Margaret. Ohhhhhh! 3 more hours till my date! (Next scene at the kitchen, with Rigby talking to Muscle Man) Hey, Muscle Man, do you know what I like best about Margaret? The way she's not going out with this guy!

Muscle Man: Ohhhh!

Rigby: Ohhhhhh! 2 more hours till my date.

Muscle Man & Rigby: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

(Next scene in the living room, where Mordecai and Rigby are playing a video game)

Rigby: Aw, man! This is just like earlier! (Imitating Margaret) Mordecai, help! These boxes are too heavy! (Normal voice) Mordecai can't help you, Margaret, he's too busy not asking you out! (He wins the game and the female video game character comes out) Oh, yeah, Margaret. (The game characters are now tongue kissing, and he mocks the tongue kiss to Mordecai, who looks jealous) Ohhhhhhhhhh! Only one more hour till my date. And that's exactly how it's gonna go down. (It is now the night time, and Mordecai is still in the living room with the T.V static on. Rigby comes out, getting ready for his "date" with Margaret. He is wearing a black tie and is combing his hair back) Hey, Pajama Sister, what are you doing? Watching T.V. all by yourself? Well, that doesn't surprise me, since you can't talk to chicks.

Mordecai: I'm warning you man. You better call her and cancel.

Rigby: I can't cancel, that's being rude. I can't be rude to the ladies. Besides I've got... (looks at his watch) twenty minutes till my date.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Are you sure it's only twenty minutes till your date?

Rigby: Huh? (looks at watch again, and sees that there is no battery inside) What did you do with my battery?

Mordecai: It could be twenty minutes till your date. Or maybe it's half an hour, or maybe you already missed it!

Rigby: Whatever! I'll find out what time it is!

(Rigby runs to find a clock that reveals what the real time is, Mordecai gives chase. The first clock is on top of a shelf, which Mordecai takes with ease. The second is Pops' cuckoo clock and drives on with Mordecai taking every other clock in the house. The last clock Rigby tries to check is the microwave, which Mordecai blocks with his hand)

Mordecai: Call it off with her.

Rigby: You're jealous, Mordecai! It's all over your face!

Mordecai: My face isn't jealous! (Puts all the clocks in the microwave)

Rigby: Dude, what are you doing? You can't do that!

Mordecai: Can't do what? This? (Shuts microwave door, turns on the microwave, and the clocks melt) Now you'll never be on time for your date.

Rigby: (jumping on Mordecai) Gimme back those clocks!

Mordecai: No!!

(They fight, but then Mordecai accidentally gets tackled to the microwave, which teleports them away through a powerful electrical surge. They both scream as they move in top speed.)

Rigby: What's your problem?! Why do you have to be jealous all the time?!

Mordecai: Shut up! This is all your fault! I finally get a chance to ask out Margaret, but you had to butt in and ruin everything!

Rigby: No, I didn't! I just wanted to see Zombie Dinner Party with my bro, who flaked on me, for some girl who doesn't even know he exists! (pushes Mordecai)

Mordecai: I'LL KILL YOU!!! (Mordecai then shoves Rigby. He falls off the microwave and yells, and his body disintegrates and becomes dust. Rigby is dead)

Mordecai: RIGBY!!! No, that's not what I meant! That's not what I meant! Go back! Go back, go back, go back! (The teleportation is now done, and is now in a dark abyss, and bumps into an invisible blockade, which destroys the microwave) (echo) Hello? (walks around, and keeps bumping into the invisible blockade.)

Father Time: Hey! Who's screwing around up there? (Then there is a bunch of clocks floating around, revealing a man made out of clocks) Oh, it's you.

Mordecai: Who are you?

Father Time: I am Father Time. And you're the one who's been running around microwaving all my clocks.

Mordecai: I didn't mean too.

Father Time: (sarcastically) "You didn't mean too." You've wasted my time, your time, and you really wasted the time of that guy you killed. He's dead.

Mordecai: I know, I'm sorry. Can you bring him back?

Father Time: No, his body has been blown to bits of star-stuff. And now, you get to spend eternity here at the end of time. All because of your pity jealousy.

Mordecai: I'm not jealous.

Father Time: Yes, you are!

Mordecai: No, I'm not!

Father Time: Silence! Peer into my Truth Hole. (the clocks that make up his body pull back to reveal an enormous hourglass right before Mordecai's very eyes)

Mordecai: What is that? (The Truth Hole reveals all of the times where Mordecai is jealous throughout the entire episode) It's true, I am jealous of Rigby, and even though he's annoying, he's still my best friend. You're right Father Time, I deserve to be trapped here.

Father Time: I'll be honest, Mordecai, house guests really annoy me, I mean just look how you wreaked my living room. (Reveals nothing, since it's invisible)

Mordecai: (faking it) Oh, sorry.

Father Time: You better be. Now, I'll give you a do-over just this once.

Mordecai: Aww, man. Thanks so much.

Father Time: But remember, stop bottling up your emotions, because if I ever get you back here again, you'll be sorry. Now, get on the Time Pony.

Mordecai: Time Pony?

Father Time: Aww, come on, it's right next to you. (Revealing to be invisible) There you go. (Mordecai gets on the pony) That's how you ride a Time Pony?

Mordecai: What?

Father Time: That's just weird. Now get out of my dimension.

(The Time Pony rides off, redoing back to the coffee shop, where the episode started)

Mordecai: Rigby! You're-you're here!

Rigby: Shhh! We're watching the trailer.

Announcer: Zombie Dinner Party.

Mordecai: That looks awesome.

Rigby: I'm glad you said that, because I got us... BAM!!! (throws 2 tickets on the table) 2 tickets for opening night! Wanna go with me?

Mordecai: Yes I do. (Rigby smiles)

Margaret: Hey, guys, your food's almost ready, sorry for the hold-up.

Mordecai: Hey, Margaret. (Grabs a coffee cup) Uh, looks like you've got a latte on your plate. (laughs nervously)

Rigby: You're gonna have to excuse Mordecai here. He has a hard time trying to "espresso" himself.

Margaret: (laughs) Good one, Rigby. I'll be right back with your food, guys.

Rigby: Dude, did you see how hard Margaret laughed at me? (Mordecai now looks jealous, again) Oh, dude, you're jealous! Admit it!

Mordecai: Dude, I'm not-- Well, maybe just a little bit.


(The episode begins with Mordecai looking at photo booth pictures of him and Margaret in his room. While Mordecai stares at the pictures, a ringing is heard. We see CJ riding a tandem bike.)

CJ: Hey, Mordo! You comin'? The back of this bike is not going to ride itself!

Mordecai: Comin'! (Mordecai runs out of his room)

(We cut into a montage of Mordecai and CJ doing different activities. Mordecai and CJ are first seen riding the tandem bike. Second, they're seen rollerskating. CJ makes Mordecai look away so she can get ahead of her. Third, they go to the Community College to paint pictures. They both draw each other very poorly, and they laugh it off. Fourth, they go to a restaurant called Nesbit's Burgers & Bits. They both order a burger with many different condiments; including a slice of pizza, a couple scoops of ice cream, and several gummy worms. Mordecai and CJ both take a bite on the count of three. They immediately spit it out because of the horrible taste , and they laugh it off. Lastly, they're seen doing donuts in the golf cart. Mordecai and CJ are seen walking on a dirt path in the park.)

Mordecai: This day was awesome!

CJ: Yeah. I had a good time.

Mordecai: Do you want to come and watch X-Treme Barista with me and Rigby?

CJ: I can't. I gotta go to work. But I'll be able to watch it there. Hey, text me, and it will be like we're watching it at the same time.

Mordecai: Heh. Phones are awesome.

CJ: Yeah, they are! Alright, I gotta go. Gimme a hug, you loser.

(Mordecai and CJ give each other a hug)

Mordecai: Later.

CJ: See ya.
(Clock transition to the house)

Announcer: (on TV)  Today, on X-Treme Barista, K-K-K-Kid Crunchy Z!

Kid Crunchy Z: Yo, yo, yo! I ain't come to here to make friends, I came here to make blends, dawg! So Yuji better watch what's up!

Yuji: (considering his name, he has an Asian accent, and he does) Yo, you see that? Well these three golden barista awards prove that Yuji is number one! So whats he gotta say to that?!

(We now see Mordecai and Rigby sitting in the living room)

Rigby: (excitedly) Man, Yuji is gonna French press this guy!

Mordecai: Pfft! (Modecai is on his phone texting to CJ. He writes "Are you watching xtreme barista? hilarious!" While doing so, he says exactly what he's writing. Mordecai pushes "SEND", and the message is sent. CJ responds by saying "Haha yes! So bad it's good!") Haha. "So bad, it's good." She's so funny.

Announcer: (on TV) One minute begins now. He's adding an energy drink!

(Kid Crunchy Z is seen adding a can of "Thunder Jolto" in a pan.)

Mordecai: Haha.

Rigby: (frustrated) Ugh! All you do is text CJ. Just tell her you like her and quit Pulling a Mordecai.

Mordecai: What?! That's not a thing!

Rigby: (grunting wimpishly, while shaking his arms) "I'm Mordecai, I never make a move, (looking at his hands) And I don't know what to do with my hands". You've been doing this for years.

Mordecai: I'm not like that with CJ!

Rigby: So how come you aren't dating yet?

Mordecai: 'Cause we're just friends. Not every girl I hang out with has to be a potential girlfriend.

Rigby: Shut your excuse hole! Yuji's on.

(Yuji is adding swan-shaped foam into a cup of coffee.)

Yuji: Ain't nobody can make a swan-esspresso like Yuji can! (goes to an athlete) Care for a sip? (athlete leans in, but Yuji swipes away) You don't drink from the cup! You drink from the sky! (throws coffee in the air, pulls out a gun and shoots it) Still warm.

Rigby: Wow!

Mordecai: Hahaha. (looks at his phone and reads) "Cappuccino he di-dnt!" (types) "I like Yuji".

Announcer: Uh-oh!

(Auto correct to "you hi" appears on the phone. Cops are next to Yuji.)

Yuji: Is this some kind of Yuji psyche?! (releases himself and goes to the camera) Yuji will return, yo! Buy my book, suckers! (cops beat him down)

Mordecai: Hahahahaha. (In slow motion, Rigby cries "Yuji!" and Mordecai continues laughing as he sends the message. He looks down and sees it) Whaaa?! No, no, no! Cancel, cancel, cancel! (The message is sent. Mordecai groans)

Rigby: Ugh, what now? My favourite barista probably has rabies and you'reWoah. What happened?

Mordecai: I texted CJ "I like yuji", but it auto-corrected to "I like you hi". (Mordecai and Rigby look in shock as CJ types.) "I like you too. Hi."  Wait, what? Aw, no. What am I gonna do? 

Rigby: Destroy the phone with acid. That makes the text go away. 

Mordecai: What? That's not gonna work. I'm gonna have to ask some real people. (We see him in his and Rigby's room) So that's what happened. How do I tell CJ that I don't "like" like her, I just like her, you know? 

(Muscle Man, Skips, Fives and Thomas are in the room.)

Skips: So you pulled a Mordecai, huh?

Mordecai: What theCome on! How long have you been calling it that?

Muscle Man: How long have you been Mordecai?

(Muscle Man, Fives and Skips act like Mordecai when he's around girls, then laugh. Rigby laugh and Mordecai punches him.)

Rigby: Owww!

Mordecai: Ugh! Come on, what should I do?

Skips: Tell her the truth.

Mordecai: Hmmm, hmmm. Thomas?

Thomas: Well, my second girlfriend liked dancing, but my fourth girlfriend was more into the DJ scene. So, uh, try, try that.

Mordecai: Okay, not really sure why you're on this panel. Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: One word, bro: Cellphone thief.

Mordecai: Huh? (Muscle Man takes his phone) Hey!

(Muscle Man dials CJ's number.)

CJ: Hey, Mordecool.

Muscle Man: (in deeper voice) This isn't Mordecai. This is a common criminal. I've been stealing phones and texting people "I like you hi" all day.

CJ: I know it's you, Muscle Man. What are you doing with Mordecai's phone?

Muscle Man: Uhh...(makes police siren noises) Cops are coming, gotta go! (hangs up and gives back Mordecai's phone) Sorry, bro. That always works on Starla.

Mordecai: Ok, any more advice?

Hi Five Ghost: Well, you'd have to wait 4 years, but-

Mordecai: Ok, anything I can actually do? (everyone except Rigby groans and walk out) That was a dead end.

Rigby: Ugh! Just talk to her already so we don't have to do this all day! I have my own life, you know. I got this book-signing thing I wanna go to.

(A commericial appears on their TV.)

Announcer: Yuji will be at Books, Zines and In-Betweenz signing his new book, "P.S I Love Yuji" today!

Rigby: See?

Mordecai: That's it! Yuji. I'll get a picture of me and Yuji and I'll send it to CJ and write "I like you hi". Then I'll send "Oops, I like Yuji. Dumb autocorrect". Then she'll know my first text was a mistake and her feelings won't get hurt. We'll be able to keep being friends and my life won't be ruined.

Rigby: Whoo, that's bad. That's like one of my plans. (they both walk out) You're lucky I'm going there anyway. Just don't make look bad in front of Yuji.

(Cut to Books, Zines and In-Betweenz.)

Yuji: And that was the day....i lost my innocence. (wipes tear and puts on glasses) At making coffee! Not at making out with girls! I did that waaay earlier...(wide view) to the extreme! (light and smoke appear. Rigby claps. They walk up to him) Sup, Yuji fans.

Rigby: (puts his book on the table) It's an honour to meet you, sir. (Yuji signs the book)

Mordecai: Yeah, uh, huge fan.

Yuji: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. No problem.

Mordecai: Actually, I need a favor. You see, Yuji, I sent a text about you to this girl-

Yuji: And my name auto-corrected to "you hi"?

Mordecai: Uh, yeah. How did you know?

Yuji: (stands up) It's the only reason I'm not famous! If people could viral market by texting about me, I wouldn't be signing books! I would be signing diamonds!

Mordecai: Um, yeah.

Yuji: "Um, yeah" is right, bro! I went to this tattoo shop and check out what happened. (reveals a tattoo on his back that says "You Hi")

Mordecai: Hmm. So can I get a picture with you to show what I was texting about?

Yuji: Let me check my planner. (we see a reminder under Tuesday 15 that says "Buy more planners?") I think I can pencil you in.

Mordecai: Awesome! Where do you want to take the picture?

Yuji: Ohhh, we can take it anywhere extreme!

Mordecai: Um....How about the roof?

Yuji: Can I base-jump off it afterwards?

(Cut to the three of them on the roof.)

Rigby: (setting the phone) Ok. Ready?

Yuji: (blocking his head) Ugh, the glare from the sun is too extreme.

Mordecai: I thought you liked thing extreme.

Yuji: Not when it comes to white balance, bro! We gotta wait for that cloud to float over and block that sun.

(text message sounds)

Rigby: Hey, you got a text from CJ. It says "I get off work in half an hour - text me then."

Mordecai: Ugh! We're running out of time.

Yuji: Ok, so picture won't work. Let me text this X-treme-Anita. (takes phone)

Mordecai: Uhh...

Yuji: "Sup, this is Yuji, blowin' up your call brick!" Sendo! (the "Yuji" is revealed to have corrected to "you hi") Ex-sqeeze me? (types) Re-sendo! (message has the same result) Urrgh! What the extreme?! Stupid phone! I can't even send my own name! Ooooh, I hate myself! (drops phone) I'm such a loser. (kneels) I never should have changed my name from Eugene Mendalman.

Mordecai: (picks up his phone) Let me try. (starts texting) I can still fix this. (show that he sent "That was the real You hi!") Ugh, come on! (texts again) Send! (same message) Aaaaaaah!

Rigby: Dude, chill!

Mordecai: (texting) Maybe if I type "you hi", it'll auto-correct to "yuji" (multi-sends "you hi" to CJ) Send! Send! (phone in violation) Whaaaa-

(Mordecai's phone sucks himself and Rigby into it as they scream. Yuji stands up.)

Yuji: I guess warping into a phone is kind of extreme.

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby transported to a familiar place.)

Mordecai: Whaa...? What's going on? What are we doing here?

Answering Machine: Welcome to the Virtual Messaging-- What theIs that you, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Oh...hey...hey guys...how have you been?

Answering Machine: Oh, you know. Oh, hey our band put out a demo tape. (shows Mordecai demo tape)

Mordecai: Oh, cool.

(The tape name is "fax me gently" by "Phoning in In")

Answering Machine: It's sort of an ambient prog-rock fusion. You can keep that.

Tin Cans with String: We had to move on after you didn't call.

Mordecai: Uh, that's alright-

Answering Machine: Enough reminiscing! You stand accused of breaking the golden rule of textingsending the same text message three times.

Tin Cans with String: And that's the worst thing in the world.

Mordecai: What? Why?

Answering Machine: It's super annoying.

(Chalkboard writes "and Lame!")

Tin Cans with String: Yes. And some of us have very limited data plans.

Rigby: Uh, well, he's really sorry.

Mordecai: I'm really sorry!

Rigby: It won't happen again, so if you could just show us the way out--

Smoke Signal Fire: Burn them!

Answering Machine: (sighs) But he's right. This is your second offense! You won't be getting off so easy this time.

Mordecai: I just pressed the wrong button.

Tin Cans with String: You don't press the wrong button three times in a row.

Mordecai: Listen. I'm...I just really gotta go. Okay? (walks away)

Rigby: What?

Answering Machine: Tell us what the problem is.

Mordecai: Nah, I'm just...You know.....(floats off) Going this way...

Answering Machine: Where do you think you're going?!

Rigby: Dude, you're being really weird! (Mordecai starts swimming) Mordecai, what are you doing? Come back!

Answering Machine: You'd rather float towards the infinite abyss than talk about your problem?

Smoke Signal Fire: This is a safe place!

Answering Machine: What are you floating away from?

Mordecai: I...I don't wanna talk about it.

Answering Machine: Do you not wish to be with this CJ? Her texting history shows she's quite the witty and independent young woman. And she's quite fond of you. (Mordecai stops) There's nothing out there for you. Literally nothing! It's really boring! Trust me!

(Mordecai sighs and goes back to Rigby and the guardians.)

Mordecai: I really do like CJ.

Rigby: Pfft. Duh, you do.

Mordecai: I'm just afraid of what'll happen because...(sighs) part of me is still waiting for Margaret to come back.

Tin Cans with String: Daddy's girl?

Rigby: What? Still? She's not coming back, dude. She's gone.

Mordecai: Look, I know, alright? I know! It's just....I mean, I don't still have feelings for her, but I do in a way. It's like this thing that's inside of me, and it's always just sort of sitting there, waiting around, and sometimes I'll see something, or I'll smell something, and it makes me think of her even though I don't want to. I really like CJ, she's amazing. But, is it fair for me to go out with her if I still think about Margaret sometimes?

Rigby: Dude, CJ's way cooler than Margaret.

(Guardians talk in agreement.)

Tin Cans with String: This is a normal part of life.

Answering Machine: Where one phonecall ends, another begins. Even if you don't leave a message after the beep.

Mordecai: So, what should I do?

Tin Cans with String: That's for you to decide.

(Door pops up for Mordecai and Rigby to leave.)

Answering Machine: Uhhhh, also, if you have a music blog or something, we could really use some positive reviews.

Mordecai: Uhhh....

Rigby: Yeah, we'll look into it.

(They leave.)

Answering Machine: This is it, guys. This is gonna be our big break!

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby appearing back on the roof. Mordecai checks his phone, and see a message from CJ that says "What are all these weird texts? Is something going on?" He replies with, "Date tommorrow?")

Rigby: Are you sure about this?

Mordecai: (with a straight face) I'm tired of "pulling a Mordecai".

(He hits "SEND".)

Rigby: Nice.

(CJ replies with "Date date?" Mordecai replies "Yes." CJ replies with a winky face.)

Mordecai: Yeah!

Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai: Wait. What does a winky face me- (CJ texts again) "That means yes. Don't misinterpret it." Haha! Alright. (texts) "See you soon". (sends text)

Rigby: I'm proud of you, man.

(The two watch the sunset.)

Yuji: (hangliding from a roof) X-treme Yu-Jump! Whoo-hooooooo!

(End of "I Like You Hi.")

(Episode starts with Eileen telling Mordecai, Rigby and CJ about some turtles)

Eileen: And that concludes my interpretive dance piece asking if you want to watch baby sea turtles hatch tonight at sunset.

CJ: Whoa! Who can pass that up? I'm in!

Mordecai: If we're going to be at the beach,that means we can go camping!

Rigby: Do you know what goes with camping and beaches? Buh-buh-buh-buh-bonfires!

All: Sea Turtle Hatching Beach Bonfire Party!

(cuts to Mordecai, Rigby, Eileen and CJ in a car driving to the Beach)

CJ: Where do we turn off next, Eileen?

Eileen: (while looking in her bag) Hold on, let me check the directions! (finds some trail mix) Trail Mix? Oh no! This is my recreation bag! I left the directions in my school bag by mistake!

Rigby: (Takes the trail mix from Eileen) Wump-wump! (eats the trail mix)

CJ: Remember Eileen, if we get lost, moss always grows on the south side of the tree!

Eileen: North side. No worries, I know exactly where I left the directions. (gets her phone and calls Margaret) Hey Margaret, are you at home now? (Mordecai's and CJ's face look embarrassed) Oh great! You see that bag on the counter? It has directions to Sunset Cove in it. (switches to CJ's worried face) Can you read them to me? Uh-huh! No, we already passed that! Slight right on left-hand road or-(Rigby is annoyed)

Rigby: Gaaah! This is taking forever! Just put her on speaker! (puts Margaret on speaker and puts Eileen's phone next to CJ)

Margaret: Did you get that, Eileen? Eileen? (she isn't answering) Eileen, are you there?

Eileen: Uhh, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

Margaret: Oh Good. If you get lost, just remember, moss always grows on the south side of the tree!

Eileen: North side.

Rigby: That's hilarious, CJ just said the same thing!

Margaret: Wait, am I on speaker?

CJ: I see the turn, no more directions, bye!  (turns Eileen's phone off)

(they have arrived at Sunset Cove)

Stan: Welcome to Youth Topia!

Mordecai: Uh, thanks? Can we go through?

Stan: Your membership cards please!

Mordecai: Oh, no. We're not members, we just wanna go down to the beach and-

Stan: (gasps) Non-members!

Blond Youth Topia Leader: Who's a non-member, Stan? Is it these guys? This is a private spa! Get outta here, non-members!

Rigby: We just wanna have a Beach Bonfire Sea Turtle Hatching party!

Stan: Aw! These simple non-members are kinda cute when they're mad!

(the two leaders laugh)

CJ: Come on, let's park more further down so we can hang at the beach. (drives away)

Blond Youth Topia Leader: Did you hear them say all that stuff!? (continues laughing)

(the car parks at the beach, they get out some equipment and Rigby even gives Eileen a ride down to the beach on his back while laughing)

Eileen: Here! (Rigby falls over) Can you believe it? Turtles for generations have been laying eggs in this sand! (Rigby has some sand in his mouth, so he tries to yell)

(scene cuts to the evening)

Mordecai: These tents are pretty cool, when they're not smashed to bits!

CJ: I know, right! Well I think it's about time we get our snack on!

Mordecai: I think Eileen's got some snacks in the cooler!

CJ: Nice!

(CJ walks to the cooler and picks it up while Rigby and Eileen are picking up some wood)

Eileen: Remember, only dry wood, Rigby!

Rigby: Dry-shmy, big diff! (Eileen sighs) What's got you down? We're doing a turtle thing! Woo!

Eileen: It's just, I wish Margaret could be here.

Rigby: Why didn't you invite her? (Instantly remembering) Oh yeah-the whole Christmas kiss thing with Mordecai.

Eileen: I get why CJ doesn't like Margaret, but Margaret's my friend. I don't know, I just wish we could all be friends.

(CJ looks down and runs to Mordecai)

Rigby: We got wood! Huh! (throws it on the ground)

Eileen: It's almost time for the turtles to hatch! We gotta find their nest!

CJ: Me and Mordecai will go get some more firewood. Come on Mordecai! Let's go!

Rigby: But we just got some!

(CJ is walking with Mordecai)

CJ: So it's like, I don't wanna put Eileen in this position, but I just can't stand to be around Margaret right now!

Mordecai: Yeah. But it doesn't change the fact that Margaret and Eileen are still friends. She just needs to know that you're still okay with your friendship.

CJ: Yeah, but I know this trip is important to her and everything but, I can't help what you did.

Mordecai: Uhh, well, hey look! What's that light up ahead?

(Behind a rock, they see the back of a spa of Youth Topia where members are relaxing while sea turtles are being abused by working as slaves in everyday activities, such as massaging a member's back, being used as shades for their eyes and cotton wool for their toes, and mud baths)

Yoga Teacher: And breathe.

(The sea turtles are being used as pillows for the members)

CJ: What are they doing with those turtles?

(Stan and Blond Youth Topia Leader are watching TV next to a pool)

Narrator on TV: Here at Youth Topia, we have dedicated ourselves to the Fountain of Youth. How have we accomplished this? Simple. Sea turtles. They're sciencey stuff, and turtles makes you look younger. Just ask this doctor.

Doctor: Huh?

Narrator on TV: But enough of that egghead. Let's see what this 90 year old man has to say about this.

(Sea turtles covers up the old man's face and his face turns young, and the man talks in foreign language; "I look young again!")

Mordecai: Wow, that's really messed up.

Blond Youth Topia Leader: You're going to the beach for the turtle hatching tonight?

Stan: You know it, man! Gonna get me a fresh new turtle! The younger, the better!

Blond Youth Topia Leader: Yeah, mine's getting old.

(The turtle coughs)

Stan: Ew!

CJ: (gasps) Eileen's turtles!

Mordecai: Come on, we gotta warn her.

Youth Topia Employee: Fresh turtles! Fresh out of the eggs!

(They bump into the employee, making him spill the turtles, which fly into Stan and the Blond Youth Topia Leader's faces, then they stand up and see Mordecai and CJ)

Stan: NON-MEMBERS!!!!

(Two employees grab Mordecai and CJ by the arms)

Mordecai: You guys are sick!

CJ: Yeah, we're gonna call the cops!

Stan: They're already here. They've got lifetime memberships. Ain't that right, officers?

(Two cops named Hank and Glenn get up from a pool)

Hank: Looks like we got some troublemakers here, Glenn!

Glenn: Yeah, real turtle-huggers, Hank!

Hank: Time to take them to their shell! Their prison shell! (cell) See what I did there?

(Stan, the Blond Youth Topia Leader and the cops throw Mordecai and CJ into their police cruiser)

Stan: Sit tight, non-members! Now, let's go get some fresh baby turtles so we don't look old anymore!

(They chant as they walk down to the beach where Rigby and Eileen are and Eileen is looking for the nest)

Rigby: I'm not seeing any turtles, Eileen! Are you sure this is the spot?

Eileen: Give them a minute! They're shy, misunderstood creatures like me. It's almost sundown. Where are Mordecai and CJ? They're gonna miss it.

(CJ kicks the bars theee times)

CJ: We've got to get outta here before those creeps get to the turtles!

Mordecai: Quick, call Eileen!

CJ: (dials a number) Come on, Eileen... Come on, Eileen...

(A ringing sound is heard, she takes out Eileen's phone from her pocket, realizing that she still has Eileen's phone)

CJ: (groans) I forgot! I took her phone from earlier!

Mordecai: (groans) Well, the cops are no good. We gotta call somebody for help!

CJ: (sighs) I can't believe I'm doing this. (Dials another number)

(The eggs are starting to hatch)

Rigby: It's moving, it's moving!

Eileen: They're hatching!

(The Blond Youth Topia Leader grabs their shoulders)

Stan: Right on time!

Hank: Thanks for making our job easier. Gage 'em and cage 'em, Glenn!

(Glenn places a crate in front of them)

Eileen: But you're officers of the law! Why are you doing this?!

Hank: 'Cause without these turtles, my face would like a ball of raisins in an old leather jacket.

Stan: Look! In the sand!

(Baby sea turtles pop out of the sand and start to crawl to the crate)

Glenn: No turtle can resist the cage!

Eileen: No, little ones! It's a trap! Don't go in!

(The baby sea turtles stop and look at Eileen)

Hank: Lettuce (Let us) persuade them, Glenn!

(Glenn places a piece of lettuce in the box)

Hank: See what I did there?

(The baby sea turtles crawl inside the crate)

Eileen: No!

Rigby: (growls) Let those turtles go! (slaps the Blond Youth Topia Leader's hand and breaks free) Sandboning! (Hits the sand, which hits the Blond Youth Topia Leader's face) Get to the turtles!

(Eileen runs to rescue the turtles. Stan blocks the way, but Eileen pushes him out, then Hank blocks her path, but she slides under him, but he grabs her and she and Rigby get thrown in the sand)

Rigby: I got my rights!

(Glenn closes the crate)

Hank: Don't worry. You'll understand when you're older. (Laughs evilly)

(Chopper 6 appears above them)

Rigby: Hey, could it be?!

Frank: Chopper 6 right on time!

Eileen: Margaret's dad?

Frank: Are we late for the Beach Bonfire Turtle Hatching Party?

(He lands Chooper 6 on the beach and Margaret, a camera man and a boom operator come out of the helicopter)

Margaret: Unique New York, unique New York. Okay, I'm good, Murray, let's roll it. We're here at lovely Sunset Cove where a scene that's anything, but lovely is happening. Youth Topia Spa is allegedly using baby sea turtles for anti-aging purposes. Youth Topia employees, do you care to comment on this?

Stan and Blond Youth Topia Leader: Uh....

Margaret: And you! You're officers of the law! What do you have to say for yourselves?

Hank: Well... (His dentures fall out of his mouth)

Margaret: There you have it, folks. The use of baby sea turtles may make you less gross on the outside, but it sure to reveal how gross you are on the inside.

Eileen: (opens the crate) Baby sea turtles, listen to me. You don't have to make old people look young. You can live! You have a choice!

(The baby sea turtles look at each other, crawls out of the crate and starts to crawl towards the spa)

Eileen: Go, little ones, be free!

(Mordecai and CJ see the baby sea turtles crawl to the spa)

Mordecai: What is that?

CJ: I think those are Eileen's turtles.

Youth Topia Employee: Fresh turtles! Straight from the egg! Huh?

(He sees the baby sea turtles crawling towards him, he tries to escape, but the baby sea turtles grab him and eat him. All of the baby sea turtles eat the members from the chairs and the mud bath)

Yoga Teacher: And breathe. (He sees the baby sea turtles coming towards him) Just keep breathing! Keep breathing! Aah! (He gets eaten)

(Three baby sea turtles jumps into one Youth Topia employee's face and attack him, then one baby sea turtle jumps into one member's face)

Youth Topia Member: Cancel my membership!

(Another baby sea turtle jumps into the member's face and punches him in the face. The baby sea turtles drops a tank, releasing more baby sea turtles, then they drop a tiki torch stand, burning the entire spa down. The baby sea turtles crawl to the police cruiser and one breaks a window and breaks the door with his superhuman strength, freeing Mordecai and CJ)

Mordecai: Come on! Let's get outta here!

(As he and CJ retreat, the baby sea turtles jump into the driver's seat and form in human while one hits the brakes, and the police cruiser is heading straight towards Stan, the Blond Youth Topia Employee and the cops)

Glenn: Hey, Hank, is that our cruiser?

(As it continues to drive towards them, they put on a seatbelt and shades)

Stan: Come on, let's bail!

(They try to escape, but the baby sea turtles grabs them and they're driving up a hill and heading towards a cliff)

Baby Sea Turtle: Let's sea (see) if these pigs can fly!

Hank: Huh?!

Baby Sea Turtle: Do you see what I did there?

(The drive off the cliff and they land in the water, which the cruiser explodes, killing Stan, the Blond Youth Topia Employee and the cops, then four baby sea turtles rise out of the water and clap)

Rigby: Woah! Turtles are awesome!

Margaret: Eileen! Are you okay?

Eileen: I'm fine, but how did you know we were in trouble?

Margaret: CJ called and told me the whole story.

Eileen: Wait, CJ called you on the phone?!

CJ: On your phone, actually.

Eileen: CJ!

CJ: Somebody had to save those turtles. We couldn't call the cops, so the news was the next big thing. And it just so happens, we know a news woman. Besides, I figured you wanted all of your friends here for this.

Eileen: (sniffles and gives them a hug) Oh, you guys!

(They look away uncomfortably as Mordecai smiles nervously and Chopper 6 takes off)

CJ: Uh, Eileen?

Eileen: Just a little longer.

(The Youth Topia spa explodes)

(Episode ends)

(The episode begins on a lovely day at the park, where Mordecai and Rigby are picking up trash at the park)

Mordecai: Man, how can people be so lazy? There are trash cans, like, everywhere.

Rigby: Maybe they didn't see 'em.

Mordecai: What? You're defending these people? I suppose you enjoy being stuck out here cleaning up all this?

Rigby: Yeah, 'cause I found these. (Holds up tiny, bronze-colored shoes)

Mordecai: Whoa. Wait, what are you going to do with bronze baby shoes?

Rigby: I don't know, I'll think of something.

Mordecai: Wait, are you just filling your bag with cool stuff you find?

Rigby: Yeah, man. People leave all sorts of junk here. You just gotta look.

Mordecai: Man, I didn't even think to look. All I got is trash. (Dumps the trash onto the ground. Mordecai then sees a plastic army figure on the ground and picks it up with the stick) Yeah-yuh! (holds up figure) Army dude.

Rigby: See? It's true what they say. One man's trash is another man's pleasure.

Mordecai: Treasure.

Rigby: (Confused) What?

Mordecai: One man's trash is another man's treasure, not pleasure. That's just weird.

Rigby: Well, it's a pleasure to find treasure, so same-diff.

Mordecai: Whatever.

(M&R realize that there is a quarter on the ground. We hear its jingle, before:)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Gasp) Quarter!

Mordecai: Jinx!

Rigby: (Picks up quarter) Yeah, this treasure's my pleasure! (Mordecai punches Rigby in the arm) Hey! (Mordecai does another punch to him)

Mordecai: I said "jinx," dude. You're jinxed.

Rigby: Fine! You can have the quarter. Geez. (Another punch) Du-- (Mordecai raises his fist, then, Rigby quickly covers his mouth)

Mordecai: You know how this works, man. You can't talk when you're jinxed. And if you talk, you're gonna get punched. So keep your mouth shut.

Rigby: Fine. (Another punch) Owww!

(Clock transition to a montage of the game continuing. M&R are playing some video game, and Rigby succeeds)

Rigby: Ohhhh! In your face! (Mordecai punches Rigby once more, and goes back to playing before we cut to a scene with M&R wearing sunglasses)

Mordecai: Whoa! Look, dude! (A solar eclipse is occuring)

Rigby: That's amazing. (Another punch. This one sends Rigby to the ground, but he continues to watch the moon cover the sun entirely) So... beautiful. (Another punch) Ow!

(Cut to Rigby in the bedroom, reading a book. Mordecai enters with an open box)

Mordecai: Dude, check out what came for you in the mail.

Rigby: Aw, yeah! (Runs over and looks in the box) What is it? (It's a sucker punch from Mordecai, right through the box. Rigby's utterings continue:) Totally. (Punch) Nice. (Punch) Come on! (Punch) Can you pass the-- (Mordecai punches Rigby again, knocking his bowl of cereal over) GWAH! (Angrily slams the table, stands up, about to yell something, but catches himself)

Mordecai: What? What is it? You can tell me anything, dude. (Rigby growls and sits back down) Dude, you know you can just break the jinx by having someone say your name three times. (Rigby seems surprised) Wait, I didn't tell you that? (Rigby's surprise turns to anger) Hm, I guess I didn't 'cause everybody knows that. I was wondering why you didn't break it sooner. (Rigby runs off) Better keep your mouth shut, 'cause I'll be listening!

(Cut to an annoyed Benson, observing the still-present trash on the ground)

Benson: Of course all of this trash would still be here. Why do I even try? (Hears Rigby's footsteps) Hey, hey! Get over here right now!

(Rigby, thinking he's found a getaway, runs up to Benson)

Rigby: Benson! Hey man, I need you--

Benson: No. Stop. Don't say anything. (Points out trash) What is this? You guys expect me to let this slide?

Rigby: No. Yes. I don't know. Look, I just need you--

Benson: Uh, what you need? Well, what I need is for you to start cleaning this up right now, or you're fired!

Rigby: Okay, okay. I'm doing it. But can you just say my name three-- (Sees Mordecai behind a tree)

Benson: What? Say your name? (Mordecai raises fist) Why do you want me to say your name? (Turns to see Mordecai) What, what are you looking at? (Sees him and Mordecai runs away) Is that Mordecai? (Tries to get Mordecai's attention) Mordecai! Mordecai, get over here this second or you're fired! (Rigby throws a can of soda at Benson's head, getting his attention) What the heck, Rigby?! What's the matter with you?! (Seeing the open door, Rigby throws another can of soda at Benson) Agh! Rigby! 

(Rigby throws the rest of the trash. Benson then throws a temper tantrum. Screaming, he pounds the ground, then, he goes over to the cart, throws a can of compost up into the air, and when it falls, he kicks it, still screaming. Rigby looks on)

Rigby: Just say my name one more time!

(Sees Moredcai next to him)

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm! Hm! (Another punch)

(Scene changes to the park water fountain where Pops is looking at his reflection in the water)

Pops: (Laughing)

(Rigby appears and shakes Pops)

Pops: Oh, hello. (Rigby trys to tell Pops that he's jinxed, but he can't talk, so he tries charades) (Gasps) Are we playing charades? Good show! I just adore parlor games. Next we can play Bits and Bobbles. (Rigby grunts) Okay, yes, I'm getting ahead of myself. Go, go!

(Rigby points to Pops and pats his chest)

Pops: Friends till the end.

(He gets it wrong and Rigby does it again)

Pops: Oh, dirty raccoon.

(Rigby grunts, then points to three of his fingers and pats his chest)

Pops: Three dirty raccoons?

(Rigby grunts and holds up three fingers)

Pops: Raccoons' brains are three times smaller than normal.

(Rigby gets mad and holds up three fingers and shakes his wrist)

Pops: No, uh... Three out of three raccoons can't read.

(Rigby groans and Mordecai walks up)

Pops: Oh, Mordecai, have you come to play charades with us?

Mordecai: Not if this guy is giving the clues, he blows at this game. Pops is never gonna get it. No offense, Pops.

Pops: Oh, none taken. I agree, he's terrible.

Rigby: (Growls) Shut up! I'm good!

(Mordecai punches Rigby)

Pops: Oh, he's jinxed!

Mordecai: Haha, yes, you got it, Pops!

Pops: Oh, I love a good jinxing.

(Rigby groans and runs to Skips' house. He opens the door and runs to a meditating Skips.)

Skips: What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.

(Rigby grabs a piece of paper, writes on it, and shows him the paper, which says, "I'm jinxed. Say my name 3 times!")

Skips: You know, for some people, writing is talking, so you're kinda breaking the rules.

(Skips punches Rigby)

Rigby: Agh! Aw, I didn't even say anything.

(Mordecai punches Rigby)

Mordecai: That's what you get for cheating.

Skips: Sounds count too, right?

Mordecai: Sounds totally count.

Rigby: Sounds count?

(Skips and Mordecai punch Rigby with both fists. Rigby whines and runs away while Mordecai and Skips laugh)

Mordecai: Do you wanna follow him?

Skips: Yeah, why not? I'm not doing anything right now.

(Skips gets up and they walk towards the door. The scene changes to Rigby running to look for someone to unjinx him)

Rigby: Gotta find somebody, gotta find somebody!

(Sees Hi Five Ghost coming the other way and stops)

Rigby: Fives! You gotta help me, man! You gotta say my name three times!

(Hi Five Ghost looks at him unhappily, not saying anything)

Rigby: I'm jinxed, and Mordecai's taking this way too far! You gotta say my name three times!

(Hi Five shakes his head 'no')

Rigby: Come on!

(Hi Five Ghost is still shaking his head 'no')

Rigby: (Whining) Why not?!

Hi Five Ghost: Because I'm jinxed, too.

(Muscle Man comes out from the bushes and punches Fives to the ground)

Muscle Man: Aha! No talking while you're jinxed, loser.

Hi Five Ghost: (Weakly) Help...me...

(Muscle Man punches Hi Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Shut your mouth!

Rigby: Hi Five Ghost, Hi Five Ghost, Hi Five Ghost!

Muscle Man: Hey!

Hi Five Ghost: (Gets up and laughs) Whoo!

Rigby: Dude, help me back!

(Hi Five Ghost leaves)

Rigby: No, wait!

Muscle Man: Dude, what'ya do that for?

Rigby: I'm sorry, I just needed to get rid of my jinx.

Muscle Man: Why don't you take it off yourself?

Rigby: You can do that?

Muscle Man: Pbtt, yeah, it's easy. Now, here's what you gotta do.

(Muscle Man starts whispering something to Rigby, Rigby runs away, then Muscle Man laughs.)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man, have you seen Rigby?

Muscle Man: Yeah. I just told that loser how to unjinx himself.

Skips: You didn't tell him about the mirror thing, did ya?

Muscle Man: Yeah, I did. He's just gonna be talking to himself in the dark. It'll be hilarious!

(Muscle Man laughs)

Skips: We gotta stop him.

(Rigby is seen running towards the men's bathroom. When he gets there, he locks the door, turns off the light, walks to the mirror, and turns the hot water on all of the sinks, causing the mirror to fog up. He's about to write on the mirror when he hears Mordecai knocking on the door.)

Mordecai: Dude, open up! Come on, let us in!

Rigby: No way, man. You guys are just gonna hit me again.

Mordecai: We won't, I swear. (Off-screen) You just gotta come out here and we'll break the jinx.

Rigby: Just break it now, then.

Skips: (Off-screen) That's not how it works. It's gotta happen face to face.

(Rigby groans and walks back to the mirror)

Mordecai: No, dude! Muscle Man doesn't know what he's talking about! Come out of there, you idiot! Rigby!

(Ignoring Mordecai's knocking, Rigby continues to write his name on the mirror and sees that everything he writes on the mirror becomes backwards above it)

Rigby: Whoa... (Writes the rest of his name and stands back) Rigby...

(Lightning is heard and a dark figure is seen in the mirror)

Rigby: Rigby.....

(Lightning is heard again and the dark figure is seen again)

Rigby: Rigby.

(Purple eyes are seen and Ybgir comes out of the mirror, trying to scratch Rigby. Rigby avoids the attack and runs to the sinks, panting. Ybgir growls, making Rigby scream. Ybgir attacks again, disconnecting a sink from the wall as Rigby runs into a stall. In it, a man is seen reading on the toilet.)

Man: Do you mind? I'm trying to get some reading done.

(Rigby gets out of the stall, sees Ybgir, and runs while Ybgir breaks the stall and sees the man)

Mordecai: Rigby, open up! Rigby!

(Rigby runs out of the bathroom screaming, then trips. The man is seen thrown through the roof of the restroom and lands on the ground while Skips, Mordecai, and Rigby scream. Three long scratches are shown on the man's back.)

Skips: That guy's dead.

(The man is gets up and transforms into a demon werewolf, similar to Ybgir. He turns around and growls at them)

Mordecai: That guy's not dead.

(Ybgir then crashes through the wall of the restroom, stands next to the demon man and Skips, Mordecai, and Rigby scream. They run away as Ybgir chases after them and scratches people that are in it's path, transforming them into demons; scene then goes to Muscle Man chasing Hi Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Come back here! I'm not done with you yet!

(Ybgir then scratches Muscle Man)

HI Five Ghost: Muscle Man!

(Muscle Man then turns into a demon werewolf and continues chasing after HI Five Ghost; scene goes to Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips running)

Mordecai: Dude, what is that thing? It's like you, but evil!

(Scene then goes to Benson cleaning up litter)

Benson: Ugh, can't believe I have-

(Sees Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips running towards the golf cart)

Benson: There you are! Get over here and-

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips get into the golf cart)

Rigby: Come with us, Benson!

Benson: What?! I'm not going anywhere until-

(Ybgir comes and scratches Benson)

Rigby: Benson!

Skips: Step on it!

(Mordecai speeds away while Ybgir chases them)

Mordecai: Skips, do you know what we're supposed to do?

Skips: I've seen this before. You gotta-

(Ybgir catches up to them, grabs Skips' leg and yanks him off the cart)

Skips: No!

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!

Rigby: Jinx!

Mordecai: (Punches Rigby) Shut up! Wait, maybe the monster will go away if I un-jinx you.

(A bunch of demon werewolves are seen in front of the golf cart's path)

Rigby: Stop!

(Mordecai steps on the brakes)

Mordecai: It's Pops!

(Pops is seen being held hostage by the demon werewolves)

Pops: Where are you taking me? I demand you put me down at once.

(A demon werewolf sees Mordecai and Rigby and growls at them, making Mordecai and Rigby scream while the other demon werewolves walk towards them)

Rigby: They see us! Go, go, go, go!

(Mordecai steps on the gas pedal and they speed away from the demon werewolves)

Rigby: You gotta do it now, man! You gotta unjinx me!

Mordecai: Alright. Rigby, Rigby, Rigby! (Rigby tenses, then relaxes) Did it work?

(Rigby looks behind them and sees no one)

Rigby: I think so.

(Mordecai screams as Ybgir jumps out of the trees and in front of him and Rigby. He then turns the cart away from Ybgir)

Mordecai: I thought you said it worked!

Rigby: We're gonna die!

Mordecai: Dude, calm down. Think: what happened while you were in the bathroom?

Rigby: I said my name three times and that thing came out of the mirror!

Mordecai: What else? What else?

Rigby: I locked the door, turned on the water, shut off the light...

Mordecai: The mirror! We gotta get back to that mirror!

(Mordecai turns the cart around and they speed towards the restrooms. They run inside and Mordecai locks the door)

Rigby: I don't think that's gonna help, man!

Mordecai: Wha..?

(Sees the huge hole in the wall and Ybgir hops in front of it. It howls, calling the rest of the demon werewolves to walk towards the restroom)

Mordecai: Oh, man. Do it, dude, do it!

Rigby: (Looking at the mirror) Rigby, Rigby, Rigby! (Bangs on the mirror) Come on! 

Mordecai: They're still coming! Together!

(Mordecai runs to the mirror)

Mordecai and Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

(They turn around and see a demonized Benson, Pops, and Skips entering the hole. Ybgir jumps through the hole in the ceiling, howls, and lands in the restroom)

Mordecai and Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby! Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

(They bang the mirror and Ybgir is seen running towards them)

Mordecai: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

Mordecai and Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

(Their breath creates a fog on the mirror which reveals Rigby's and Ybgir's names)

Mordecai: (Gasps) His name's in reverse.

(Ybgir is still seen running and is getting closer to Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ybgir, Ybgir, Ybgir!

(The scene goes to slow-motion as Ybgir jumps, about to scratch a scared Mordecai and Rigby, when a portal is seen opening in the mirror; Ybgir gets sucked into the portal and a white screen is shown for a second. Back into daylight,Mordecai and Rigby walk outside and find the scratched victims in their underwear, confused on what just happened)

Benson: Mordecai, Rigby! You two are in so much trouble!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hey, Benson.

Mordecai: Look Benson, I can totally explain.

Benson: I don't wanna hear it. I wanted that trash picked up hours ago.

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Mordecai: We're sorry, Benson.

Rigby: Yeah, we'll do it right away.

(Benson is about to say something, but stops himself)

Benson: Well, alright.

(Benson walks away)

Rigby: Hey, look.

(Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi Five Ghost are seen and Pops and Muscle Man are shirtless)

Pops: How on earth did I get here?

Muscle Man: Ugh, my head...

Pops: Has anyone seen my hat?

(Skips is seen skiping up to Mordecai and Rigby)

Skips: Looks like you guys are off the hook. Nobody remembers anything.

Mordecai: How come you haven't lost your memory?

Skips: My mind's a steal trap. And don't do that again.

(Skips skips away)

Mordecai and Rigby: We won't.

Rigby: Jinx, haha!

Mordecai: Uh, eh, whatever.

(Rigby starts punching Mordecai)

Rigby: No talking while you're jinxed! (Grunts 'repeatedly) How do you like it?! (Realizing his punches don't affect Mordecai) How do...you...like...it...?

Mordecai: I feel bad for you that you'll never be able to fully enjoy this game.

(Pause, then Rigby gets mad and pokes Mordecai in the eye, making him yell as the episode ends)

(Episode starts with the park guys having a meeting)

Benson: Alright listen up, we've gotten some complaints about the huge sinkhole in the park.

Mordecai: Sinkhole? You mean the Crash Pit?

Muscle Man: You're talking smack about the Crash Pit, bro?

Benson: Yes. It's a potential liability and we're not properly insured for it. It has to be filled immediately.

Mordecai and Muscle Man: Aw, what?

Rigby: Aw, no way!

Muscle Man: Come on Benson, you can't fill up the Crash Pit.

Rigby: Can't we just put up more warning signs or something?

Benson: No! A thing called a "Crash Pit" shouldn't even be at the park in the first place.

Rigby: What if we call it a "small hole"?

Benson: JUST FILL IT UP BY THE END OF THE DAY OR YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!

(scene cuts to the guys holding two shovels and looking down at the Crash Pit sadly)

Mordecai: Man, I'm sure gonna miss this old Crash Pit.

Muscle Man: Yeah, bro, we had a lot of good times here.

(A montage of the two cars got hit and explode, Mordecai driving a bus with Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost, the guys bailed out of the bus, the bus goes down to the Crash Pit and explodes and people cheering, and The guys shaking all of the sodas and put them into an old car, the car goes down the Crash Pit, exploding, soda drops started to come out and the guys are tasting the soda drops. )

Mordecai: Hmm, good times.

Muscle Man: You thinking what I'm thinking?

Rigby: One last crash?

Mordecai: One last crash in the Crash Pit!

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

(Muscle Man presents a busted-up car to his friends. He also shows expired fireworks. And Muscle Man has a camera with a protective case in hand.)

Muscle Man: Ahh. Old Toluca. This baby got me around all through high school. I've been saving her for a moment like this. You got the camera, Fives?

Hi-Five Ghost: Yeah. I rented it from the park A/V with this protective cage, too.

Muscle Man: Nice. Gotta play it safe. Now to throw these expired fireworks into the trunk.

(He puts the fireworks in Old Toluca's trunk)

Muscle Man: Gotta send this puppy off with a bang!

(The four guys get in Old Toluca with the camera, and Muscle Man starts the stunt making road dounts)

Muscle Man: Savage! Savage! Savage! Whoo Whoo Whoo!

(Now they're driving straight to the Crash Pit.)

Mordecai: Dude, roll the camera! Roll the camera!

(Rigby powers on the camera)

Rigby: It's rolling! It's rolling!

(Mordecai takes the camera and points it to himself)

Mordecai: Ok, let me see, let me see. This is Mordo coming to you live for one last crash in the Crash Pit.

(He points the camera to Fives and Muscle Man)

Mordecai: Any final thoughts, Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: Savage! Savage! Savage!

(Mordecai points the camera to Rigby)

Rigby: Uh, I think we're getting too close, guys.

(Mordecai points it to the Crash Pit)

Mordecai: Don't bail on us now, dude. This is history in the making.

Rigby: No, seriously! I think we should get out now!

Mordecai: Dude, don't bail! Don't bail!

Rigby: DAAWHAHAAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!

(Rigby rolls out first. Muscle Man, Fives, and Mordecai laugh)

Mordecai: All right, let's go let's go!!

(Fives flies out of the car, Muscle Man and Mordecai roll out. The car heads straight to the Crash Pit. The car explodes with smoke and firework sparks coming out of the hole.)

Mordecai, Rigby Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Whoo-hoo!!!!!

Muscle Man: Best last Crash Pit ever! (high fives Hi Five Ghost)

Mordecai: And we got it on tape!

Mordecai and Rigby: Yea-yea-yea-yea!

Mordecai: Wait, where's the camera?

(One firework spark comes out of the hole)

Muscle Man: Oh, no bro!

Mordecai: Oh man, we've just destroyed the park camera!

Rigby: Benson's gonna kill us!

Hi-Five Ghost: Whoa, whoa, it's OK, guys, that protective cage probably kept the camera safe.

Rigby: Well, I'm not going down into some pit to get a cruddy rental camera back that's crazy!

Mordecai: Dude, chill we can probably just replace it. How much can an old camera cost anyway?

(Cut to Thomas working at a device storage)

Thomas: Let's see it's 5000 dollars.

Mordecai, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Aw, man.

Rigby: What?!

Mordecai: How can it be so much?

Thomas: It's the Vidmax Ultra-Res 30500, you can't get that clarity on VHS anymore, it's a collector's item.

Rigby: We can't afford that!

Thomas: Why, did something happen to it?

Muscle Man: No.

Thomas: 'Cause Benson reserved it to film his parents' wedding vow renewal tomorrow. If you guys lost that camera, he'll probably fire you.

Muscle Man: Nothing happen to it, stop prying into our affairs, Thomas! Huddle. (everyone huddles) We have to get that camera back.

Hi-Five Ghost: But how? The Crash Pit goes down forever.

Mordecai: We have no choice, it's either go into the pit or lose our jobs?

Muscle Man: Yo Thomas, where can we rent some climbing gear?

Thomas: You're in luck. I know a guy in the Rock Climbing Department. (the guys go to the Rock Climbing Department and Thomas puts on a hat) How can I help you guys?

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Ugh...

(The gang begins their mission. Fives ties one end of a rope to a tree, and the others put their belts on.)

Muscle Man: Fives, cinch me!

(Fives does as told, Muscle Man grunts. Rigby throws the other end of the rope into the Crash Pit, and Muscle Man, Rigby, and Mordecai put the rope onto the belt hangers. The team climbs down to the bottom of the giant hole.)

Mordecai: Bottomless pit not so bottomless.

Rigby: YEAH! Take this, Crash Pit!

(Rigby tries to grip on the exit of the hole with two fingers.)

Rigby (imitating): Oh no, stop crushing me!

Muscle Man: Bros, check it out.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoaaaaa!

(The guys marvel at a junk yard made up of cars they threw in over the years.)

Mordecai: It's like a crash museum.

Hi-Five Ghost: It's glorious!

Rigby: Hey Muscle Man, there's your old summer home!

(A white camper is shown, followed by a green car)

Muscle Man: Casa del Sorenstein. Oh, and my old buddy the War Admiral!

(He sits on the War Admiral's front seat and butt grooves on it)

Muscle Man: Still got it. Hey, I wonder...?

(He opens the compartment to find a bag of beef jerky)

Muscle Man: Bonus!

(Fives found Old Toluca)

Hi-Five Ghost: Hey, guys, I found the car!

(The others go over to the car, and Muscle Man pulls out the cage used to protect the camera now busted up)

Muscle Man: Protective cage my butt.

Rigby: Where's the camera?

Muscle Man: I don't know. It wasn't in the car.

(A devilish laughter is echoed from a tunnel opening.)

Rigby: What was THAT?!

(More laughter is heard. And the guys notice footprints that go into the tunnel.)

Mordecai: Someone's in there.

Rigby: Aw, no way, man! This is freaking me out!

Mordecai: Dude, our camera could be in there.

Rigby: I'm not crawling into some dark hole!

Muscle Man: YOU'RE a dark hole!!!

Mordecai: Look, when Benson sees we haven't filled up this pit, he's gonna do it himself. And I don't wanna be down here when that happens. So let's just go get the camera and get out of here.

(Mordecai turns on a flashlight and walks into a tunnel with Muscle Man and Fives along. Rigby reluctantly follows.)

Rigby: UGH! Fine.

(Pops and Benson approach the hole)

Benson: RAAAAARGH! Why do I even bother?! I can't trust those guys to do the simplest task!

Pops: Well, this hole is rather big, Benson.

Benson: Oh, how hard can it be?

(Benson walks up to a shovel on a dirt pile and throws some dirt into the Crash Pit. Realizing how deep it is, he takes out his walkie-talkie)

Benson: Skips, Plan B.

(The guys approach the end of the tunnel)

Mordecai: Aw, man. Dead end.

Rigby: Well, we tried. Let's go back.

Mordecai: No, Rigby. We can't leave without the camera.

Rigby: Dude, forget this. The camera's gone and we're running out of time. Benson's probably gonna fill up the hole before we even get back, then we'll be trapped!

Muscle Man: Easy, bro! The dark is messing with your head. Now just calm down.

Rigby: Don't touch me! I can't breathe! Dark spaces! Need air!

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

Muscle Man: (laughing) That sound never gets old.

Rigby: That wasn't me.

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

Mordecai: Wait. It IS you, but... on the camera

(Mordecai approaches the wall and hears Rigby's girlish, hilarious scream. Some voices cackle to the scream)

Muscle Man: Whoa! Gnarly, bro!

Mordecai: The camera's gotta be on the other side

(Mordecai finds a shift gear installed to the wall)

Mordecai: It looks like a stick shift.

(Mordecai pulls it down to D and the rocks that form the wall come off to reveal a garage gate. It opens and the guys go in as Rigby's scream gets closer and the cackling gets louder.)

Mordecai: This way.

(The gang hides behind some barrels and notice a group of talking creatures holding onto the camera laughing to Rigby's scream.)

(The gang gasps)

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

(The creatures called the Carlocks laughed)

Carlock 1: I've never seen such cowardice.

Carlock 2: His scream is that of a tiny baby.

Rigby: Hey, I'm no baby!

Mordecai: Rigby!

(The Carlocks realized that the gang are behind the barrels)

Carlock King: Intruders!

(Two Carlocks grabbed and shoved Mordecai and Muscle Man)

Rigby: Who are you guys?

Carlock King: We are the Carlocks, the first and the last of our mighty underground race. Why have you disturbed our realm?

Mordecai: We don't want any trouble, we just want our camera back.

Carlock King: "Cam-er-a?" You mean this moving-picture machine? Nonsense. It was a gift from the Sky People.

Muscle Man: Sky People?

Carlock King: The great ones above who stow upon us the meaning of our very survival: our homes, our clothes, the occasional bag of beef jerky. For decades we lived with this as our only form of entertainment.

(Carlock 2 holds a toilet plunger with a rope on it)

Carlock 2: It was a ball and cup, but we ate the ball.

Carlock King: With this camera, we have been given the greatest gift of all: Laughter.

Rigby: Dude, there are no Sky People. That was just us messing around. You're living in a bunch of cruddy old cars we've crashed.

Mordecai: Look, we need that camera back or else we'll get fired. Just give it to us and then we'll get out of here.

Carlock 2: Perhaps we should listen to them my lord. Clearly that one is the screaming man-baby on the device.

Carlock King: Enough! The device stays with us. Now be gone, the best part's coming up.

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

(Carlocks laughed which made Rigby get mad)

Rigby: It's not funny!

(Rigby charges for the king, he drops the camera, and Rigby grabs it as the king gets an accidental punch)

Rigby: Run!

(the guys bolt it as the Carlocks chase them growling)

Mordecai: Quick, into the car!

(two of the Carlocks are trying to stop them)

Rigby: Start the car! Start the car!

Muscle Man: I'm starting it!

(A Carlock smashes the window)

Rigby: DAAAAH!!!

(Rigby uses the flashlight on the Carlocks to hold them back). Muscle Man finally starts the car and the guys drive off)

Carlock King: After them!!

(The 6 Carlocks split into pairs, and they chase the guys with three cars)

Mordecai: Hold on...!

(Mordecai crashes through the hideout entrance and the Carlocks keep pursuing them. Carlock #2 jumps from Carlock #1's car onto the guys' car)

Guys: AAAAH!!

(Mordecai pushes him of the car and back onto Carlock #1's car. Carlock #1 loses his sight and he, Carlcock #2, and their car drive off the road and into a void, assumingly dying in the fall)

Rigby: We got 'em!

Mordecai:: Hm hm. Carlocks? More like "Drive-Off-The-Road locks"!

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAA- AAH!!!

(Two other Carlocks repeatedly bumped into the guys' car)

Guys: AAAAAAAHHHHH!!

(Benson and Pops are standing and Thomas is using an excavator)

Benson: Alright, let's hurry it up. The sooner this hole gets filled, the less likely we'll get hit with the lawsuit. (He takes out his walkie-talkie) Skips, you got the truck?

Skips: (riding a truck full of dirt) Yep.

Benson: Good, 'Cause I don't think Thomas is licensed to use an excavator.

Thomas: Uhhh... Ohh... (Thomas drops the dirt into the Pit)

(The Carlocks are still chasing after the guys)

Rigby: Uh, dude, how do we get out?

Mordecai: I don't know.

(The dirt lands on the bottom of the Pit. The guys gasps)

Mordecai: Hold on. (He floors the pump to speed up)

(The guys are driving on the right side of the Pit)

Guys: AAAAAAAHHHHH!!

(Thomas drops down more dirt which the dirt landed on two Carlocks' car and exploded them. The last two Carlocks are driving after them.)

Mordecai: Almost there!

(The Carlock King jumps to the car to the open window)

Carlock King: Give us back the funny! (He and Rigby are struggling for the camera)

Rigby: It's not funny!

Benson: Dump it!

(Skips drops down a lot of dirt which made the Carlock and the car fall down and got crushed by tons of dirt. Now rocks are falling down. Muscle Man punched the Carlock King's face.)

Mordecai: We're almost out!

(They're almost out of the Crash Pit)

Mordecai: Hang on tight!

(Mordecai drives faster which made it knock off the king. The guys drive out of the Pit)

Skips: Huh?

(The guys are falling down)

Guys: AAAAAAAHHHHH!!

(The car lands on the ground twice and the last amount of dirt stars to fall)

Carlock King: NOOOO- (The king got hit by tons of dirt)

(The guys moan as they got out of the totaled car and the guys are hurt. Benson, Skips, and Thomas walks up to the guys)

Mordecai: We did it...

(Rigby gives the camera to Benson)

Benson: Did you guys just risk your lives to go get this camera?

Mordecai: Well, yeah it was park property and we couldn't replace it.

Rigby: We know you needed it for your parents' wedding thing tomorrow.

Benson: Oh, well thank you. Maybe now, my dad will stop yelling at me.

(The Crash Pit is now filled)

Muscle Man: (sadly) Goodbye, sweet Crash Pit...

Mordecai: Don't worry, Muscle Man. (picks up a video tape) I know what will make you feel better.

(Cut to the guys watching the video footage)

(DAAWHAHAAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

(The guys laughed except Rigby)

Muscle Man: That did the trick, totally worth it.

Rigby: Good thing we never have to go down there again.

Thomas: Uhh, hey where's the climbing gear you guys checked out? (The guys are shocked)

(End of Journey to the Bottom of the Crash Pit)


(?)

Mordecai: In the battleground of the future. You'll need... 

Rigby: Laser-Sharp Vision, Laser-Fast Reflexes. (Panting) Hah! Uhh! 

Mordecai: And most of all, you'll need to know how fire a laser! Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! 

Rigby: (Robotic-ally) Critical Damage! Critical Damage! Beep, beep! (Imitates Powering Down) 

All: (Laughs)

Mordecai: Aw, yeah-ah! Who's ready for Laser-Pocalyse? 

Eileen: That's so cool you got a four for one pass. 

Margaret: Yeah. Laser-Pocalyse gave them to us! After I did that investigative piece... "Laser Tag Fun Game of Funniest Game?" 

Eileen: This is gonna be so fun! It's been so long since we all hung out. 

Rigby: Yeah!

Sherm: Let me guess -- you forgot.

Rigby: Forgot what?

Sherm: Your brother's fifth-degree judo cremony!

Barbera: Tae Kwon Do, Sherm.

Sherm: Whatever!

Rigby: Oh, was that tonight?

Sherm: Don't you use the "Was that tonight?" excuse on me. I taught you that! Now, look! If I got to be here, you got to be here!

Rigby: All right, all right!

Eileen: Your dad? Tell him I said Hi.

Rigby: Eileen says Hi.

Sherm: Hi, Eileen!

Barbera: Hi, Eileen!

Rigby's Family: Hi, Eileen!

Rigby: Ugh! I got to go to Don's Tae Kwon Dumb thing tonight for his stupid black belt.

Eileen: Oh, that's right. I embroidered this celebratory headband for him.

Rigby: I still think it could use more dragons.

Eileen: Come on, Rigby. Don't want to keep Sherm waiting. 

Rigby: Uggggh!

Mordecai: Rigby, can I talk to you for a sec? Dude! What the heck? You can't leave me alone with Margaret. 

Rigby: It's fine. You just hanging out as friends.

Mordecai: Yeah, but I don't know if she's gonna be cool with that.

Eileen: Are you okay being alone with Mordecai?

Margaret: I think so. We haven't hung out by ourselves in a while, so... 

Eileen: So...?

Margaret: Hey, whatever happens, happens.

Eileen: Well, either way...

Rigby and Eileen: Be strong.

Margaret: This is familiar, right? 

Mordecai: Yeah, last time we were at the movies together we were... (Chuckles Nervously) But tonight, we're friends on a fun night out. 

Margaret: (Chuckles) Right. Margaret Smith reporting live on location of a fun night out. 

Mordecai: Uh, no cameras.

Margaret and Mordecai: (Laughs and Sighs)

Mordecai: Okay, let's see what we got here. Hmm. Hmm. 

Margaret: Ooh! I've heard good things about "Lovely Shovey." 

Mordecai: Euhhhhhh. How about... that one?

Margaret: "Carter and Briggs 7 Heavily Armed: The Violencetown Flies"? All right. Yo! Got some popcorn. 

Mordecai: Nice.

Audience: (Cheering)

Announcer: Carter... Briggs... 7! Heavily Armed! 

Mordecai: Whoo!

Margaret: Yes!

Mordecai: Yeah, alright! Wha-uh? (?)

Movie Usher: Sorry, everybody. Our print of "Carter and Briggs 7". Has just spontaneously combusted. So in its place we will screen "Carter and Briggs 6: The Heart Shaped Badge". Enjoy! 

Margaret: Ooh! I've never seen this one. 

Briggs: Ah, vacation. No crime, no guns. 

Carter: Briggs, there goes that cute waitress again. Ohhhhhhhhhhhh.

Briggs: Don't worry, Carter. Over the next 3 1/2 hours. I'll help you get with her. She definitely still likes you. All you going to do is give her a sign.

Mordecai: (Gasps) You know I think I've seen this one. Let's go. 

Margaret: O... kay. 

Mordecai: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Nothing romantic here. Bunch of driving fast, gas fumes, nosy engines.

Margaret: What's that?

Mordecai: Exactly. 

Wayne: Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention tonight ain't just any night at Kartin' Safari. 'Cause tonight's my 15-year anniversary. To my beautiful Mary-Lee. Ain't nobody make my engine rev like you, darlin'. I love you, baby!

Mary-Lee: I love you, Wayne! 

Wayne: In honor, of this blessed occasion.  For the rest of the night, it'll be laps fer lovers. So strap and snuggle up. 

Mordecai: Uh, I don't know it looks pretty tight. 

Margaret: I call driver's seat. 

Mary-Lee: Your turn, stringbean. 

Margaret: Come on, Mordecai. Let's hit the track. 

Mary-Lee: Oh! Now, don't be shy. She won't bite!

Mordecai: Aah! 

Mary-Lee: Go ahead, now scooch together. 

Mordecai: (Grunting)

Mary-Lee: (Grunts) (Sighs) Maybe try putting around him?

Margaret: Like this?

Mary-Lee: Now, put his leg in.

Mordecai: Uh, I need to go to the bathroom.

Barbera: Yeah! Take him down! 

Sherm: Now, there's a son I can be proud of!

Rigby: Yeah?

Mordecai: Dude, this whole "friends" thing is not working out.

Rigby: What? Why?

Mordecai: I'm trying to do friend stuff and it keeps turning romantic.

Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai: No, not awesome. Margaret's still totally into me. 

Rigby: Sure, sure.

Mordecai: I need a break from all the drama. 

Rigby: Yeah, yeah. You do what you got to do. Oh! Here comes the best part! Hey, man. But have fun with Margaret tonight. 

Crowd: Don! Don! Don! Don! 

Radio: Rollin' hard with my boys you know how we do. Tear it up at the club out till 1 or maybe 2 Except that it's Tuesday My day stay at home with my lady. Playin' Board Games and Cruddlin by the fire

Margaret: Whoa, whoa, Mordecai!

Mordecai: (Chuckles Nervously) So... see any place you want to eat?

Margaret: Oh, hey! There's Steak Me Amadeus!

Mordecai: I don't know the last time didn't go well.

Margaret: Right. Or... Mr. Yakihana-Sama.

Mordecai: That japanese place where they grill. The food in front of you? Isn't it really smoky in there? You can barely see the person sitting next to you. (Gasps) Works for me. 

Margaret: So, where should we sit?

Mordecai: How about... there?

Margaret: Uh, the one with the super-old chef in unflatteringly harsh lightning? 

Mordecai: Yeah -- the one right by the bathroom. Let's go.

Daisuke: (Snoring) 

Margaret: (Clears throat)

Daisuke: Hai. I am Daisuke. Pleased to serve you tonight. Eh? Eh. So, let me guess. Anniversary?

Mordecai: What? No!

Daisuke: Aha. First date.

Margaret: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Daisuke: What is this? I see one boy and one girl. 

Mordecai: We are a boy and a girl. But we're boy and girls friends. I mean...

Daisuke: Sound like you don't know what you are. Tell you what -- I will do the romantic show for free or charge and whatever happens, happens. 

Mordecai: No, no, no, no, no-- Hey, what the-- I said no--

Daisuke: I could silence with you with shrimp all night. 

Margaret: It's just dinner, Mordecai.

Daisuke: Yes. Keep up romantic fast just for desert.

Mordecai: (Sighs) Fine. But cause on'y I'm-- hungry. That's it! Why does the whole universe wants us to get together?

Margaret: You noticed it, too? I've been keeping track of all werid's stuff tonight. I'm a reporter. What could it mean? I like lists sorry.

Mordecai: (Sighs) What's going on, Margaret?

Margaret and Mordecai: Sorry.

Daisuke: What of there's a way to see what would happen if you got together? Wouldn't your choice be clear then? Eh? 

Mordecai: An onion?

Daisuke: It's not the onion that is clever it is the sauce. Look at the happy couple. 

Mordecai: Whoa. It's us. 

Cloud Margaret: (Laughs)

Cloud Mordecai: Margaret, will you marry me?

Cloud Margaret: Yes!

Cloud Mordecai: Sweet our very own houseboat. We have to be fiscally responsible. 

Cloud Margaret: Mallory, don't forget your lunch.

Cloud Mordecai: Are you carpooling today?

Daisuke: Your children will become a pro video game team and support you well into old age and finally after 50 wonderful years together. You'll die peacefully. 

'Margaret and Mordecai: Uh.

Daisuke: You don't like?

Margaret: It's just a lot to take in.

Mordecai: Margaret, you're really cool and our future looks like it could be cool, too. But after seeing all that, I'm sure of what I want now. I think it would be best if we were just friends. 

Margaret: (Sighs) I am so revived to hear you say that. I thought I knew what I wanted but we're still young, Mordecai and I'm definitively not ready for all that. I mean I have a career. I think I just want to...

Margaret and Mordecai: Live in the moment. Take it easy on relationships right now. It's the best thing for the both of us. 

Daisuke: (Clears Throat) Thanks for wasting my time. Am I going to have to throw this couples sundae in trash? Last chance. Couple? Just friends? Couple? Just friends?

Margaret and Mordecai: Just friends.

Daisuke: I am okay with that. Now, take the soft serve cones of friendship. Would you like the sprinkles of friendship?

Margaret: Yes!

Mordecai: Yeah!

Daisuke: Hup!

Margaret: This has been a great friends night out.

Mordecai: Agreed.

Daisuke: Separate checks when you ready. (?)

Cloud Margaret: Mordo.

Cloud Mordecai: What is it, Margie?

Cloud Margaret: They're just friends! Do you think they can really be just friends forever?

Cloud Mordecai: Only time will tell. Let's get back to our retirement. 

Cloud Margaret and Cloud Mordcai: Mwah!

(Pops' house steps, day. Benson goes through the list of what needs to be done with Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, and two new characters: Mitch "Muscle Man" Sorenstein, a fat, green man, and Hi Five Ghost, a very self-descriptive ghost)

Benson: Alright, listen up. We've got this birthday party today, so... lots to do, lots to do... Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, you're in charge of picking up the special entertainment.

Muscle Man & Hi Five Ghost: Yes! Uh! (they high-five)

Benson: Skips, you set up the bouncy castle.

Skips: Hmm. (skips over into a bush)

Benson: Let's see, I'm picking up the kids, so... Mordecai and Rigby, you set up the chairs.

Mordecai & Rigby: Augh! (Mordecai slides down the steps, onto the ground. Pops calls from above)

Pops: Oh, what about me~? Surely, I'm invited to my own birthday party!

Benson: Um, your birthday was last week, remember? It's a kid's party today.

Pops: (pulls out a bundle of balloons) I still have balloons!

Benson: We've got it covered, Pops.

Pops: (sadly) Oh. I see. (slips out, and is carried through the air by the balloons)

Mordecai: Dude, how come we always get stuck with the lame jobs? Setting up the chairs?!

Rigby: Lame!!!

Benson: I can't trust you guys with something actually important. You're always slacking off.

Mordecai: You calling us slackers?

Rigby: Did he? Did you?

Mordecai: He's calling us slackers. Look dude, we can totally set up all those chairs without slacking off.

Benson: Good. Do it then.

Mordecai: We will.

Rigby: Yeah, and then next time you'll get someone else to set up the chairs?

(Mordecai does a shrugging motion)

Benson: Fine.

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOOOOOOHHH!!! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Not settin' up the chairs next time! UHHHHH!

Benson: Just set up the chairs.

(Transition to outside of a birthday party circus building. Mordecai and Rigby with the trolley of chairs)

Rigby: Benson's gonna drop his balls when he sees how good we set up these chairs, he's gonna be all like (imitating Benson) "Oh no, my gumballs."

Mordecai: Ha ha ha! Yeah-ya, we rule at settin' up the chairs. (hands Rigby a chair) 1.

Rigby: Yaaa! 1! (throws chair it falls on the ground) Yeah dude, this sucks.

Mordecai: I agree dude, and normally I'd be all "let's quit", but we have to prove to Benson we can set up these chairs.

Rigby: All right. AAGGGHHH! Must be nice to be the boss. Benson never has to do chores.

(Scene is now set to the highway, and Benson is driving a bus full of kids. The kid with the crown and a drink named "Jimmy".)

Benson: Happy birthday Jimm--

Jimmy: Just drive the bus, you crazy slop jockey!

(Scene goes back to Mordecai and Rigby)

(Rigby is wearing a bunch of chairs, imitating a robot wreaking mass destruction.)

Rigby: BEW! BEW! BEW! PSSHHH! BEW! HA HA! (knocks over the chairs)

Mordecai: What the H, dude?

Rigby: Hahahahahahahaha!

Mordecai: Can we please just focus?

Rigby: AGGHHH! (takes off chair) When you say that, it makes me tired. (sits)

Mordecai: Dude!

Rigby: Agghh! You sound like Benson.

Mordecai: Dude, listen. If we pound through this, we'll never have to do this lame chair stuff again.

Rigby: (gasp) Next time it could be us picking up...

Mordecai & Rigby: The special entertainment!

(Scene goes to where the special entertainment gets picked up by Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost)

(Muscle Man knocks on the door.)

(Door opens showing eyeballs)

Muscle Man: We are here to pick you up.

(Door opens showing a horse)

Special Entertainment Horse: Just a second.

Special Entertainment Clown: Aghhyyyagghh... who's at the door? Whoa, it's bright! (Puts on sunglasses)

Muscle Man: You know who likes special entertainment like that? My mom!

Special Entertainment Clown: Could I borrow five bucks?

(Scene goes back to Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai: 37... (Rigby throws chair, Mordecai holds it, and puts it down) 38...38...Rigby!

(cut to Rigby lying on the trolley with no more chairs)

Rigby: That's all the chairs, dude.

Mordecai: There's supposed to be 50.

Rigby: That's Benson's problem.

Mordecai: No dude, that's our problem.

Rigby: HMM!

Mordecai: C'mon, we've gotta find the rest.

Rigby: Fine! (gets up and runs to the side of the structure, getting ahead of Mordecai) Let's find your stupid chairs. (Rigby approaches a door, and pushes it effortlessly, likely as an attempt to ditch the job.) It won't open, let's get out of here.

Mordecai: Did you try the actual door knob?

Rigby: Aagghh, you're killing me... (slides his hand over the door knob, again, effortlessly.) It's locked, let's do something else.

Mordecai: C'mon dude, take this seriously. (grabs the door knob and turns it both ways, but turns out Rigby's moaning about it being locked was spot on.) Oh, it is locked.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm.

Mordecai: We've gotta get those chairs. (Mordecai runs at the door)

Rigby: HEY! (Mordecai slams into the door, knocking it down)

Mordecai: AAAGGGHHHH!! (he's on the floor rubbing his arm in pain)

Rigby: Whoa!

Mordecai: Agh, you see the chairs?

Rigby: Even better...

Mordecai: What do you mea-- (gasp) (The two see arcade games all set up in a line.)

Rigby: It's like old school heaven!

Mordecai: Yeah, look at these things! Ball of Yarn, Lemonade Stand, Hats 4 Sale, Clap Like This, Candle Maker, Deli Dude, Staring Contest?!?! Why are these even here?!

Rigby: Who cares? Let's play! (Mordecai grabs his head)

Mordecai: No dude. Dude, no. You want Benson to think we're slackers forever?

Rigby: I don't know. Do you want to be boring forever?

Mordecai: Not cool dude.

Rigby: Whatever, I'm taking my break. (Rigby starts game and idiotically smashes his fist against the buttons.)

Mordecai: Dude, you're not even doing it right. You're just mashing the buttons.

Rigby: Whatever, why don't you go back to work?

Mordecai: I know, how 'bout I take my break too? (Mordecai knocks Rigby out of the way and plays the game without the button mashing) Bam! (Game screen displays "You win") OHHHH!!!

Rigby: Man, that was just luck.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. (Mordecai starts the game again. A montage begins of Mordecai and Rigby playing each game, and Mordecai winning every time while Rigby mashes the buttons. All the while with Mordecai yelling "OHHH!" with every win. And for the climax...) OHHHH!!! TEN IN A ROOOOWWWW!!!!!! Alright, let's finish those chairs.

Rigby: Wait man, what about that one? (Rigby sees another game in the back, which has a note "Out of order" and is covered by a sheet)

Mordecai: Didn't they teach you how to read? "Out of order".

(Rigby gives him a look and takes the sheet off. Revealing a game called "Destroyer of Worlds")

Rigby: Whoa! This... looks... awesome!

Mordecai: Yeah, whatever, it's broken.

Rigby: Probably because people couldn't stop playing it, cause it's so awesome!

(Rigby bangs at the bottom of the stand in a pitiful attempt to fix the game)

Mordecai: How are you gonna fix that with your third grade education?

Rigby: Hey! Why don't you go ask Benson to tell you what to do?

Mordecai: Move over, Rigby.

(They open the control panel, and when they do, they find a note attached to one of the wires.)

Mordecai & Rigby: (reading) "In the name of all that is holy, don't connect the red wire to the blue wire"?

Mordecai: I don't think we should do this.

(Rigby takes the note, throws it behind him, and tries to connect the two wires to get the game to work, all the while with sparks flying every time.)

Rigby: C'mon c'mon!

(Rigby successfully connects the wires and a smoky face of Destroyer of Worlds appears)

Destroyer of Worlds (smoke version): Ha, ha, ha ha!

(The power goes out)

Mordecai: Dude, what just happened?

Rigby: I don't know.

(Game turns on, but with the power in the building still off. The game's turning on force sends Mordecai and Rigby flying and when they look back at it, the Destroyer of Worlds spawns)

Mordecai: That can't be good.

Rigby: I don't know, it could be cool.

(DOW blasts a hole through the wall)

Mordecai: Oh man, we're so dead.

Rigby: Maybe no one will notice.

(DOW shoots lasers and sets the trees on fire)

Pops: Oh, who unleashed the Destroyer of Worlds? Good show!

Mordecai: We better go find Skips.

(Mordecai and Rigby run to Skips, who is currently setting up the bouncy castle.)

Mordecai & Rigby: (panting)

Mordecai: Skips, uh dude.

Skips: What did you guys do?

Mordecai: What? Nothing. Heh.

(DOW still shooting lasers, destroys the playground's slide.)

Destroyer of Worlds: Ha, ha, ha, ha!

Skips: You ignored my note, didn't you?

Mordecai: A note? What note?

Rigby: You mean like a musical note?

(DOW shoots his laser again, this time setting the bouncy castle on fire.)

Skips: You fools! Destroyer of Worlds will kill us all!

(Destroyer of Worlds appears behind them and laughs evilly)

Skips: I have an idea, but I need time. Distract it!

Mordecai: Wait, what? Distract it how?

Rigby (picks up a rock): Get outta here! (throws the rock at DOW, which in turn hits the floating face. The response is a frown, signalling more attacks coming their way.) Uh-oh.

Mordecai & Rigby (while getting chased by the DOW): AAAHHHHHH!!!!

(Benson pulls up with the bus)

Benson: We're here... AAAAHHHHHH!!!!

(DOW goes up to the bus)

Kids on the bus: It's the special entertainment! Yay!

(DOW blasts through the top of the bus, opening up the roof. In response, Benson and the kids on board scream. The kids run off of the bus and then run into Muscle Man and High Five Ghost, who are arriving with the real special entertainment.)

Muscle Man: Hey kids. Get ready for our very special entertainment!

(Right as they begin to perform their act, with the horse waving, Destroyer of Worlds fires his laser at the two, disintegrating them into ashes. The kids scream again and scatter around the park, Destroyer of Worlds setting more of the park on fire.)

Mordecai: We're screwed.

(Skips arrives back in the cart with a set of Arcade stands)

Skips: Get in!

(Mordecai and Rigby run to the cart and it takes off in pursuing the Destroyer of Worlds.)

Skips: Climb on top but don't press start until I say.

(Mordecai and Rigby climb onto the top of the golf cart and Pops crashes into the golf cart)

Pops: Skips my good man! I lost my balloons.

Skips: Take the wheel.

(Skips leaves the cart and Pops starts the driving in chasing the Destroyer of Worlds)

Pops: It must be my birthday!

Skips: Okay everyone, press your start buttons on three. One, two, three!

(Everyone presses start, which in turn creates a huge video game character much bigger than the floating face in Destroyer of Worlds.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

(Destroyer of Worlds fires his laser at the character.)

Skips: Mordecai and I got the arms, Rigby, you got the legs.

Rigby: (mashing the buttons) Aw what, legs?! Legs suck man, this is worse than the chairs!

(The video game man is spinning round in circles firing pixelated burgers all over the place, not at Destroyer of Worlds)

Mordecai: Dude, quit mashing the buttons, you're messing up the legs!

Rigby: SHUT UP!!!

(After a moment of jumping about, the character runs away, with Destroyer of Worlds giving chase.)

Skips: Drive, Pops, drive!

Pops: This is so much fun! Woohoo!

(Pops hits the pedal on the cart and chases after the two battling characters. As they get ahead of Destroyer of Worlds and drive in front of hit, the mask fires a laser at the cart, knocking off Skips in the process.)

Mordecai: Skips! Pops stop, we lost Skips!

(Pops skids the cart to a halt.)

Mordecai: Skips! (Destroyer of Worlds destroys an other building, Mordecai gasps in turn seeing the extra chairs) The extra chairs! Dude, you kill the Destroyer of Worlds, I'm gonna go get the chairs!

(Mordecai jumps off the top of the cart)

Rigby: It's too dangerous, just leave them!

Mordecai: I don't care, we're not slackers!

(Destroyer of Worlds follows Mordecai to the building, firing at him.)

Rigby: (gasps, believing that Mordecai was shot) MORDECAI!

(Mordecai is inside the building holding onto one of the chairs, taking cover from the Destroyer of World's lasers)

Mordecai: AAAHHH!

(Rigby starts mashing all of the buttons on every arcade stand. Which begins to work as the Destroyer of Worlds is taking damage from the pixelated burgers)

Destroyer Of Worlds: WHAT THE...

Mordecai: The button mashing's working! Finish him off dude!

Rigby: AAAAHHHH!

(Rigby mashes every button and his tail grabbing the analogue stick Skips was on. The video game character finishes off the Destroyer of Worlds, once defeated, it turns into a cherry. The character walks up to it and eats it with 100 points popping up.)

Mordecai: That was some pretty sweet button mashing. (he and Rigby hi five)

Rigby: I told you I got skills.

(Benson climbs out of a fiery ditch, red in the face)

Benson: YOU!!!!!!

Mordecai: Whoa, hey, Benson. Before you freak out, we totally set up those chairs.

(Revealing the kids sitting on the chairs, surrounded by fire. Muscle Man and High Five Ghost also joining in on the fun)

Muscle Man: Whoo! This birthday party's hot!

Rigby: So we're cool, right?

Benson: YOU IDIOTS!!! That's the last time I entrust you with something important, LIKE THE CHAIRS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOOHHHH!!! Not setting up the chairs next time! Not setting up the chairs next time!

Benson: But you are gonna clean up this mess, and you can start by sweeping up the special entertainment.

(Benson walks away)

Mordecai: Yeah, no problem.

Rigby: We got it.

Mordecai: Don't worry about us.

Rigby: We're gonna take a break first, right?

Mordecai: Yeah.

(End of Episode)

(The episode starts off with Mordecai and Rigby washing the cart, while Muscle Man is playing the guitar.)

Muscle Man (singing): You're the pickle on...no...no...you're the cheese on my burger...uh...burger...(normal voice) Yo bros, what rythmes with burger?

Rigby: "Shmurger"?

Muscle Man: Mmm hmm. (puts down his guitar) Not bad. Not bad. What rhymes with "hottest girl in the world"?

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man what are you doing? Why don't you help us?

Muscle Man: I'm busy writing a song for Starla. Today marks a special day in the history of our relationship. It's the anniversary when we first made out. And I want it to be really special for Starla. That's why I'm gonna call K.I.L.I.T Radio and get DJ Donny G to play my song and give a shout out to Starla!

Mordecai: Dude, that's not gonna work.

Muscle Man: No, she'll totally hear it because she listens to the radio like every night.

Mordecai: No, dude. Donny G doesn't play amateur music.

Rigby: Yeah, he doesn't even take requests anymore.

Mordecai: You're wasting your time.

Rigby: There's no way they're gonna play your song.

Muscle Man: We'll see about that!

(Scene cuts to the kitchen where Muscle Man calls K.I.L.I.T. Radio and also Mordecai and Rigby are in the room.)

(phone ringing)

Phone monitor: Hello, this is K.I.L.I.T Radio~

Muscle Man: Yeah, I like Donny G to play my-

Phone Monitor: To talk to a K.I.L.I.T representative, press 0.

(Muscle Man presses 0)

Phone Monitor: Are you calling in regard to a song you heard?

Muscle Man: No, I wanna talk to somebody! (presses 0 several times) ZERO! ZERO! ZERO!

Phone Monitor: I'm transferring you to our bilingual system.~

Muscle Man: NO! (presses 0 again) ZERO! ZERO! ZERO!

Spanish/Latin phone monitor: Hola, llamaste Radio K.I.L.I.T.~

Muscle Man: (moves table & chair) Uhh!, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! (hits phone madly on the table)

(Mordecai & Rigby come to Muscle Man)

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man, calm down!

Muscle Man: Ugh! I'm a failure of a boyfriend! I can't even do something special for my girl!

Mordecai: Why don't we just go down to the radio station and find somebody to talk to?

Rigby: Yeah, maybe someone there can help you.

Muscle Man: You're right, bros. I need to take this to the source.

(Scene cuts to the K.I.L.I.T. Radio station when Muscle Man, Mordecai and Rigby come in Muscle Man's car. They get out of the car and Muscle Man presses the speaker and the security camera turns to them)

Speaker: Welcome to K.I.L.I.T Radio. Do you have an appointment?~

Muscle Man: Uhh...no but-

Speaker: You need an appointment to enter. Good day.~

(Muscle Man presses the speaker again)

Speaker: K.I.L.I.T. Radio.

Muscle Man: Look, I just want to talk to someone.

Speaker: Do you have an appointment?

Muscle Man: No, I have to sent-

Speaker: Good day.

Muscle Man: Can you believe this place!

Mordecai: Sorry Muscle Man.

Rigby: Wait, who's that?

(Car comes to a parking spot)

Muscle Man: Dudes, I think that's Donny G.

Mordecai: What? That's not him.

Muscle Man: Dude, that's him.

Rigby: Yeah, I think it is him.

Muscle Man: Watch. YO DONNY G! (Donny G looks) SEE! WOO! DONNY G! HA HA I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! My name's Mitch! Big fan!

Donny G: Uhh, thanks man. (Walks away)

Muscle Man: Listen, I need a big favor. I wrote this song for my girlfriend Starla. Could you have them play it on the air tonight?

Donny G: Uhh..

Muscle Man: It would mean so much to me.

Donny G: Yeah, okay sure I'll give it a whirl.

Muscle Man: And do an old-fashioned shout out?

Donny G: Hey, why not.

Muscle Man: WHOOO! Oh man, Starla's gonna be so stoked! Thanks Donny you're the best!

Donny G: No problem, my man.

(Scene cuts where Mordecai, Muscle Man and Rigby get in the car)

Rigby: Well, that was easy!

Muscle Man: Yeah, we totally got the hook up from Donny G! Man, I can't wait to see Starla's face tonight. She's gonna be really appreciative.

(Sees Donny G throw away the tape in his rear view mirror)

Muscle Man: *Gasps* OH NO BRO!

(Muscle Man gets out of the car,slamming the door behind him.)

Muscle Man: YO DONNY!

(Closes car door and begins running towards Donny G.) 

Muscle Man: DONNY G!!!

Donny G: Look man, it's not what you think.

Muscle Man: It is what I think! Cause I saw you! I used to think that you were cool! You know something, I see D-player could do your job!  But you know what, I still have a voice.

( Takes tape out of trash can)

Muscle Man: And this voice, on this tape won't be silenced on YOU!

Donny G: Shh, shh, shh.

Muscle Man: I SAID I WON'T BE SILENCED!

Donny G: Okay, okay.

(Donny G. glances at the security cameras warily.)

Donny G: But, we can't talk here.

(Scene cuts to 'Double Dunk Diner' where Mordecai, Muscle Man, Rigby and Donny G are sitting and talking.)

Donny G: I'm sorry for the secrecy. It's not safe to talk back at the radio station. Look, Mitch, you were right about everything you said back there. The fact of the matter is, I haven't played a song on the air in a long time.

(Scene cuts to Donny's flashback of him being a DJ at K.I.L.I.T. Radio.)

Donny G: Back in the day, K.I.L.I.T. was run by the most famous DJs in the world. We were the heart and soul of the station. And we loved every minute of it.

Past Donny G: This is DJ Donny G and we got a nine o'clock power rock block coming up next for y'all, but first a shout-out to Charles Z from Wendy R. Love ya babe. 'Cause that's how we KILL IT!

Donny G: Things were going great, until one day, the top executives showed up and enforced a new automated DJ system, just so they could cut the budget in half. Little did they know, the system learned to DJ at a geometric rate. And on August 4, 2:14 P.M. EST. time, it became self-aware. That was the day the music died.

(Shows a man being choked to death by tapes and everyone looks at him. Cartridges are thrown at everyone and the DJs evacuate the building. Everyone except Donny escapes.)

K.I.L.I.T. DJ 3000: Stay, Donny. We have a special job for you. You must stay!

Donny G: As time went on, K.I.L.I.T. Radio's new format grew in popularity.

K.I.L.I.T. DJ 3000: This is K.I.L.I.T. Radio. Clean out your ear holes, dummies!

Donny G: And as for my special job.

(Shows Donny working as a janitor)

K.I.L.I.T. DJ 3000: Now, clean me Donny. CLEAN ME!

(Donny sprays water on the system's screen)

Mordecai: So, that's not your voice on the air?

Donny G: No. It's just a computerized simulation of it.

Rigby: So that's why they don't take song requests anymore. K.I.L.I.T. needs the human touch back. It needs DJ Donny G!

Donny G: Nah. Those days are over. Now I'm just DJ Donny the janitor.

Muscle Man: Oh, forget that! You need to get back on the air!

Donny G: Eh, what's the point?

Muscle Man: The point is to not let some lame machine tell you what to do. Radio should be for the people, by the people.

Donny G: You're right.

Muscle Man: I'm glad you think so Donny G. 'Cos I gotta song to play and you're the only man to do it. What do you say we get you back on the air?

(Scene cuts to late at night where Donny G, Muscle Man, Mordecai and Rigby are standing out front of K.I.L.I.T. Radio. Donny presses a button to signal that he's arrived.)

K.I.L.I.T. DJ 3000: Unknown individuals detected. Who are these people, Donny?

Donny G: Uh, they're repairmen I hired to fix a couple of things. Can't do it all myself. Heh heh heh.

(Shows Mordecai, Rigby and Muscle Man dressed in uniforms to look like repairmen. Camera scans them and shows that since Mordecai's skinny he isn't threatening, Muscle Man's fat so he's harmless and Rigby's small so he isn't a threat either.)

Rigby: It's onto us.

Mordecai: Dude, be cool.

(Stops detecting)

K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000: You may enter.

(Opens doors and Donny, Rigby, Mordecai and Muscle Man enter the building. Muscle Man, Mordecai, and Rigby look around while the cameras are watching.)

Donny G: Alright boys, the trouble's down in the basement. Let's get you fellas set up.

(They go downstairs to the equipment room, while the cameras are still watching them)

Donny G: Okay, go grab some old equipment and patch them in the system manually.

(Rigby grabs some wires, but gets stuck.)

Rigby: C'MON!

(Other equipment falls down with a tug of the wire)

(K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000 notices.)

K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000: You're planning to overwrite the automated broadcast.

Muscle Man: Uh, no!

K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000: Intruders must be neutralized.

(Door closes and K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000 tries to attack)

Muscle Man: Not before Starla hears my song!

(Muscle Man throws a work drawer at K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000. When it gets destroyed he kicks the door open)

Donny G: We have to get to the main broadcast room pronto!

(Muscle Man kicks down the door, and they run out of the equipment room. When they enter the hallway, all the other security cameras notice and try to attack. Shooting wires, one of the cameras tangles Rigby up.)

Rigby: AHH!

Mordecai: Dude! Take out the cameras!

(Rigby throws a screwdriver at one of the K.I.L.I.T security cameras, untangling himself from the wire. Mordecai and Rigby throw various equipment at the cameras, destroying them.)

Donny G: To the elevator!

(They all run into the elevator. Donny presses the button to go to floor 3 repeatedly. )

Everyone: AHH!

(Muscle Man kicks the camera out)

K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000: Donny, You are acting very foolishly.

(By getting off the elevator Muscle Man goes first when Mordecai & Donny help him out and when they all got out, they had to climb to the top of room 3)

Muscle Man: (Grunts)

(K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000 sees him)

Muscle Man: We made it!

(Elevator wires break)

Everyone except Muscle Man: AHH!

Muscle Man: Oh no bro!

(Muscle Man holds on to everyone while getting up)

Muscle Man: (grunts)

(Scene cuts when they made it to the broadcast room)

Donny G: Hold them off when I set up!

(K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000 uses microphones to get Muscle Man, Rigby and Mordecai)

(Donny puts the equipment in the center of the radio station while the others try to fight back with K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000)

Donny G: Okay, guys we're ready!

(one record suddenly goes through Donny)

Muscle Man: DONNY G!!! (breaks the microphones and goes to him) Donny G..

Donny G: Mitch..(pants)..the tape Mitch..

Muscle Man: (takes out the tape) What do I do to play the tape?

Donny G: ..(pants)..Leave it to me.

(Gives out his hand for Muscle Man to give him the tape)

(Muscle Man gets upset and gives him the tape)

(Donny could barely be calm and goes to put the song in)

K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000: Don't do it Donny. If you play the tape, I will be forced to destroy the whole station.

(K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000 tangles Donny with the wires.)

Donny G: Go..save yourselves..No matter what you hear just keep running.

Muscle Man: I'll never forget you Donny G.

Donny G: I'll never forget you Mitch. You gave me my life back.

(Muscle Man smiles and turns back)

Muscle Man: Let's book.

(They all try to get out except Donny)

(Donny tries to put in the tape)

K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000: Don't do it Donny, I'm the DJ now, remember?

Donny G: NOW, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW I KILL IT!

(He puts it in and presses that they're on the air)

K.I.L.I.T DJ 3000: NOOOOOO!!! (Showing self-destruction in 10 seconds)

Donny G: Hey all you cool cats! This is your main man on the microphone, Donny G! Coming on live for one last time, with one very special request joining me here at the K.I.L.I.T studio with my main man Mitch!

(Scene cuts to the 'Two Peaks Mall' parking lot and to Starla's car)

Donny G: And he's got a very special song, for a very special lady, Starla.

(Starla smiles)

(Scene cuts to the studio while Donny presses the play button)

(When he pressed the play button, the self-destructing countdown ended and the studio was getting destroyed while Muscle Man, Mordecai & Rigby tried to get out and also Muscle Man's song "Starla" was being heard)

Muscle Man: (Song) I used to be a loser, hanging with my loser friends, and the first time when we made out, made my neck hair stand on end! Oh Starla, Starla-uh-uh-uh-uh!

(Scene cuts inside Starla's car when she smiles even more)

(Donny puts on his sunglasses while seeing the explosion)

(They all got out the building)

(Starla comes and gets out of her car)

Starla: Oh, Mitch! Mitch! (hugs Muscle Man) You did this all for me!!

Muscle Man: I'd do anything for you babe! Did you like the song?

Starla: It was so romantic! You remembered the anniversary the first day we made out!

Muscle Man: Not only that, I remembered how we did it!

(Starla and Muscle Man kiss)

Mordecai: I don't know, that song was kind of lame.

Rigby: Yeah, but it was pretty rad how we outran that fireball.

Donny G: Yeah, it was like a movie or something.

(The episode ends)

Mordecai: [gets out of bed] Dude wake up, come on. [yawns] It's time for work.

Rigby: [flailing] Eh-eh-eh-eh! Lame! Dude, come on, let's go watch that karaoke tape from last night.

Mordecai: What tape?

Rigby: Dude, the tape from last night, remember? That old dude with the ponytail gave us a copy of our killer performance. [he says those last two words with flair]

Mordecai: Oh, yeah. Dude, we were awesome last night.

Rigby: Totally awesome!

Mordecai: Where'd you put it?

Rigby: Put what?

Mordecai: The tape.

Rigby: Oh, yeah. I put in the fridge.

Mordecai: Oh, yeah.

Mordecai and Rigby: To keep the tape as cool as were last night. Whhhhhooooooooa! [both spin out the door]

[Cuts to inside of the fridge. Fridge door opens and tape is visible]

Mordecai: So cool.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm.

Carrey O 'Key: (on tape) Give it up for Rigby and Mordecai!

Mordecai: (on tape) Dude! [pushes Rigby and picks up microphone] Hurry up, hurry up! 

Rigby: (on tape) Alright. Hello, hello, hello!

Mordecai: (on tape) [taps Rigby] Dude, come on.

Rigby: (on tape) This is for all you hard workers out there that get treated like dirt!

Mordecai: Dude, so awesome!

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) We got the right to choose it. There ain't no way to loose it. This is our life, this is our song. (laughs) Oh, we're not gonna take it. No, we ain't gonna take it. We're not gonna take it, anymore.

Rigby: Hey, we're pretty good!

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) [dancing] Woo!

Man: (on tape) What aren't you gonna take?

Mordecai: (on tape) We're not gonna take anymore garbage from our boss Benson. What a loser.

Rigby: (on tape) Yeah, go back to your sad apartment, and be alone forever!

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) Ohhhhhhhh!

Man: (on tape) What else, what else?

Rigby: (on tape) Yeah, and this know-it-all guy Skips, forget him.

Mordecai: (on tape) Yeah, if you're so smart, then why are you stuck working as a groundskeeper?

Mordecai: (on tape) I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

Rigby: (on tape) Oh, dude, and Pops, Pops!

Mordecai: (on tape) Oh, yeah, and this guy Pops just says the dumbest things all the time. You're not as interesting as you think, Pops.

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) Ohhhhhhhhhh! [laughs] We're not gonna take it. No we ain't gonna take it!

Rigby: (on tape) Go chew on your own gumballs, Benson.

Mordecai: (on tape, imitating Pops) Oh, I'm so old timey, I don't know what anything is.

Mordecai: What the heck are we doing?!

Mordecai: (on tape, imitating Skips with a beefy voice) My name's Skips. Let me and my muscles stare at you condescendingly.

Rigby: (on tape) Walking? No, thanks. I'm too good for that.

Mordecai: Do you remember any of this?

Rigby: No, no!

[Mordecai fast forwards the tape again. Rigby and Mordecai are laughing on the tape. Mordecai fast forwards the tape again. Rigby and Mordecai are laughing on the tape again. Mordecai fast forwards the tape again]

Rigby: Wait, stop, stop!

Carrey O 'Key: (on tape) What do you think, folks? Do you like these guys?

Carrey O 'Key: (on tape) Hey, you boys don't mind if I play this video at my club as a promo, do you?

Mordecai: (on tape) Nah, whatever, dude.

Rigby: (on tape) You gotta give us a copy though, so we can re-live this night forever!

Mordecai: Dude, we can't let anybody see this.

Benson: (Off-screen) See what?

Mordecai: Uh.

Rigby: See this! Bam! [breaks tape in half]

Muscle Man: Pfft, I've seen that before. You're not the only one scared of technology.

Benson: What's this? [walks towards tape case] Carrey O' Key's Karaoke?

Pops: (gleefully) Did you say karaoke? Oh, I just love karaoke! Oh, we must go Benson, we must!

Skips: Yeah, that would be pretty fun!

Benson: Alright.

Mordecai and Rigby: (disbelievingly) What!?

Benson: Well I have been working you all pretty hard lately, so how 'bout we all go out tonight and karaoke it up, my treat?

(Pops, Muscle Man, Skips and Hi Five Ghost cheer)

Benson: Great idea, guys. Alright, let's finish our work for the day, fellas.

Muscle Man: This is gonna be awesome!

Pops: Ooh, I can feel the excitement in my bladder!

Rigby: Man, we're totally dead.

Mordecai: Dead? Dude, they're gonna hate us forever! [facepalms] Awww, why are we so dumb?

Rigby: It was the music, man! It fueled our frustrations, it wasn't our fault!

Mordecai: Whatever, we just can't let them see us trashing them. We gotta go find that master tape.

Rigby: But how are we gonna do that?

Mordecai: Dude, it'll be easy. We'll just go ask that fat dude for the tape, and if he says no, we'll just take it from him.

Carrey O' Key: I said "no"! I can play that tape whenever I feel like it, and there's not a darn thing you can do about it. I don't wanna see you punks back here again. You're banned! [slams door]

Mordecai: Benson! Hey, man, we need to talk to you about tonight.

Benson: I'm only paying for the songs. You're on your own for food and drinks. [walks away]

Muscle Man: Aww, what? Well, I've always got my gravy pouch. [pulls up shirt to reveal gravy pouch. Sucks gravy from a tube] Ahhh.

Mordecai: No, Benson, wait! We don't think going to karaoke tonight is such a good idea.

Benson: What?

Rigby: Karaoke's lame. We should do something really fun, like bowling!

Mordecai: Yeah, bowling's good! Or pool, the pool hall's always fun. Rap 'em up!

Benson: Guys, please.

Rigby: If we're throwing out halls, why not the greatest hall of them all?

Mordecai: Dance hall.

Rigby: Bingo!

Mordecai: (taking Rigby literally) Oh, bingo? Really?

Benson: Guys.

Rigby: No no no, dance hall, I was saying bingo like "You got it!". Bingo halls are for losers.

Benson: Guys! What is it with you two? I'm trying to do something nice for everyone, boost morale around here. Besides, I've already called the karaoke place and reserved a table.

Mordecai: But wait, can't we just-

Benson: No, we're going to karaoke, and you know what, now it's mandatory. Yup, mandatory having fun at karaoke night. You don't come and you're fired. [runs off] So deal with it!!!

Mordecai: Now what?

Pops: Ooh, look how many songs. I'm gonna sing them all!

Benson: No, Pops, just one. (smiling) Skips, what're you gonna sing?

Skips: Do they have anything with Spanish guitar?

Muscle Man: [fist pumping] Woo! Skips bringing it old school! Woo!

Benson: Ugh. Where's Mordecai and Rigby?

Waiter: Uh, ready to order sir?

Benson: No, we're still waiting for two. They don't think I was serious about this being mandatory. I was being serious. If they don't show up they're fired!

Pops: Ooh, they'll be here!

[Pans to vents above where Mordecai and Rigby are]

Rigby: Oh, man. Dude, we gotta hurry this up, Benson's gonna blow a fuse!

Mordecai: Rigby! [crawls towards a vent grate] Hey, I found it.

Carrey O' Key: Hey Carl, how many people signed up for karaoke so far?

Carl: Just one, boss.

Carrey O' Key: Well, dang it, that's not enough! We can't keep this place going with just one singer a night! It's time to play that dang tape! If that won't get people singing, nothing will. Now get me ready like we talked about, you know how I got stagefright.

Carrey O' Key: [laughing] Yes! Welcome, folks! Now I know some of you first timers might be a little shy but sure of your talent's with us, so we put together this little promo video to put all your fears to rest. Here we go. [plays video]

Carrey O' Key: (on tape) Scared to get up on stage to sing? Don't be! You couldn't be worse than these guys.

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) We're not gonna take it. No, we ain't gonna take it.

Benson: Oh, my.

Pops: It's Moredcai and Rigby!

Mordecai: [sees the video playing on the computer screen] Aw, dude, they're playing the promo! C'mon! [falls to ground] Ugh.

Mordecai: Wait-

Mordecai: Ugh.

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) We're not gonna take it, anymore!

Benson: So this is why they didn't want us to come tonight! They must've been super embarrassed by their singing.

Mordecai: (on tape) We're not gonna take anymore garbage from our boss, Benson!

Benson: What the?

Mordecai: (on tape) What a los...!

Carrey O' Key: Well, uh, sorry folks, um, technical difficulties. Aw, oh hey, why don't we start the songs, shall we? Uh first up we have Pops!

[Pops runs on stage]

Pops: That's me! [giggles] I've been working so hard I'm punching my card.

Pops: (voice over) Eight hours for what?

Carrey O' Key: Hey!

Mordecai: [gasps] Get the tape! Get the tape!

Carrey O' Key: Carl!

Pops: (voice over) I've got this feeling that times been holding me down.

Mordecai: Dude, what's going on?!

Rigby: I don't know, it's stuck!

Rigby: Come on, come on!

Pops: (voice over) I'll hit the ceiling. Or else I'll tear up this town

Pops: (voice over) Tonight, I gotta cut loose. Footloose.

Pops: (voice over) Kick off your sunday shoes.

[Mordecai gets the tape to be tackled by Carl.]

Pops: (voice over) Please, Louise. Pull off of my knees.

Pops: (voice over) Jack, get back. Come on before we crack.

Pops: (voice over) Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose!

Pops: (voice over) You're playing so cool.

Pops: (voice over) Obeying every rule.

Pops: (voice over) I dig a way down in your heart. You're burning yearning for songs. Somebody to tell you.

[People's hands grabbing for the tape]

Pops: (voice over) That life ain't passing you by. I'm trying to tell you that life ain't passing you by. I'm trying to tell you it will if you don't even try.

Pops: (voice over) [punches man charging at him] You can fly if you only cut loose.

[Hi Five Ghost punches a man in the face.]

Pops: (voice over) Foot loose. Kick off your Sunday shoes.

Pops: (voice over) Oowhee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me.

Pops: (voice over) Whoa, Milo, c'mon, c'mon let's go.

Carrey O' Key's: GIMME ThAT TAPE!!!!

Pops: (voice over) Lose, your blues.

Benson: You want it? Fine! Take it, then! [throws tape at the Carrey O' Key's owner, the tape breaks into pieces]

Pops: (Voice over) Everybody cut footloose! Ohhh! Cut footloose! (Spoken)Thank you.

Mordecai: Sorry, guys.

Rigby: Yeah, sorry.

Mordecai: We didn't mean to ruin your good time.

Benson: (Hurted, having hurted right eye and having bandage on his right arm.) No no, I don't want to hear it! I don't know what was on that tape, or why those guys were after it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. (turns pink) YOU'VE RUINED KARAOKE NIGHT!!!! [does a doughnut with the golf cart and drives away with Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Pops and Skips]

Mordecai: Yeah uh, I know, that's why we were trying to apologize to you. Man, karaoke sucks.

[End of 'Karaoke Video']

(Episode begins at the floating Park Dome. The park members, Eileen and Earl are at the playing field.)

Earl: Congratulatons to Pops! He has officially completed his training! More than an army's work of strength is contained within this vessel.

(Pops is feeding a peacock.)

Pops: Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

Mordecai: Was the peacock the last of your training, Pops?

(Episode begins with a person playing an electric guitar)

Announcer: Gene Hazard. (The scene then slides to another person playing an electric guitar) Vince Vandercliff, Ricky Nova and Dalph. Together, they are Mercury Heat. Known for their outrageous costumes, death-defying performances and their reputation for avoiding the press. (We see Mercury Heat avoid the news in one short scene). Until now. Channel 6 leading anchor Dal Anchor inerviews the band for the first time with the hardest (Dal winks at the studio whilst holding a clipboard)... hitting (scene cuts to Dal eating a burger and winking)... questions (scene then cuts again to Dal walking whilst holding a microphone). All their secrets finally revealed. Tonight at Eight.

(The scene then cuts to the Coffee Shop, where we see Mordecai and Rigby at a table drinking coffee)

Mordecai and Rigby: Mercury Heat!

Mordecai: I can't believe Margret gave us special press-passes. Compliments of Channel 6.

Dr. Langer: (flies into the coffee shop) Mordecai and Rigby. You took a DTV from the Dormitory.

Mordecai: D-T- what?

Dr. Langer: DTV. You know, that very expensive piece of machinery out there.

Rigby: We were only gonna use it for a couple of minutes.

Dr. Langer: Is that so? Well, I have surveillance photos that say otherwise!

(Dr Langer gets out a photo of the duo walking to the DTV. Another photo shows M and R driving the vehicle. A few more images show the duo driving (one with them flying in the air and the final one with Mordecai and Rigby driving in mud splatting the Dome Scientists with mud. The scene then cuts to Pop's House, where Benson is viewing the pictures. The duo laugh)

Benson: (turns around and Mordecai and Rigby) Can it! (turns back at Dr Langer). I am so sorry, Dr Langer.

Dr. Langer: The DTV's are meant for scientific research. They could have ruined weeks of data. There was a line there and you two guys crossed it. That's why I'm enacting a 24-hour lockdown.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: No way!

Dr. Langer: And Benson is going to make sure you don't leave the house, because if you do, he's fired!

Benson: Hey, you can't do that!

Dr Langer: Oh, yeah? Who's gonna stop me. (Benson stammers) That's what I thought. Keep them in line or we'll keep them in line for you! (flies away in a jetpack)

Benson: (gets angry and turns around at Mordecai and Rigby) I can't believe this!

Mordecai:  Benson, you know these dome rules are ridiculous!

Rigby: Yeah! You're just afraid to do anything about it.

Benson: I don't wanna hear it. Lockdown, 24-hours. Starting now!

(The duo walk up the stairs to the house)

Rigby: Ah, dude!

Mordecai: There's no way we're missing Mercury Heat.

(The episode starts out with Muscle Man in his car on his way to Starla's eating a bag of chips and listening to rock music. He almost passes by her apartment but he backs up the car. He rings the doorbell and quickly licks the chip crumbs off his shirt.)

Starla: (Opens the door) MITCH! (She kisses Muscle Man.)

Muscle Man: Wow, babe, you look lovely.

Starla: And you look... (notices Muscle Man's not wearing the same shoes) uh, why are you wearing two different shoes?

Muscle Man: (Tries to look but he isn't able to see his feet) um, geez, babe, I guess it's been a while since I've seen my feet. I've been taking a lot of power lunches lately.

Starla: (Sighs) Mitch, you know you'll always be my power lunch, but I think maybe it's time we start eating a little healthier.

Muscle Man: I guess I could try eating the salad instead of just throwing it in the trash.

Starla: (Gasps) I know, let's go on a diet!

Muscle Man: (Confused) huh?

Starla: (Takes Muscle Man's hands excitedly) I'll do it with you, it'll be fun! (Hugs Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Alright. I'll do whatever it takes to make my fun bun happy.

Starla: PERFECT! Our diet starts tonight.

Muscle Man: You mean after we go to Cheezers?

Starla: No, right now! I know a new restaurant we can try. (Voice distorted) Salad Corral.

(Transition to the house where Mordecai, Rigby, and HFG are watching a horror movie together and making fun of it. In the movie, a monster's chasing a couple who run into the woods)

Mordecai: (Sarcastically) Yeah, run into the woods, that's safer.

Mordecai, Rigby, and HFG: (Laugh)

(In the movie a monster chases after the couple. The monster looks cheesy instead of scary)

Rigby: (Sarcastically) Oh no, it's the curse of the dude in the cheap rubber suit.

Mordecai, Rigby, and HFG: (Laugh)

(Muscle Man runs in.)

Muscle Man: Bros, it's an emergency!

Mordecai: What's up, Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: It's terrible! Starla's starting me on a diet tonight!

Rigby: (Patting Muscle Man's fat stomach) Sounds like she did you a favor, man.

HFG: (referring to MM's stomach) if it gets any bigger, we're gonna have to add it to the park payroll.

(Mordecai, Rigby and HFG laugh. Mordecai and Rigby eat more chips.)

Muscle Man: This isn't funny! Sometimes you gotta sacrifice for the one you love. I wanna eat healthy, but I gotta do something first, and I need you guys to help me. Tomorrow, while Starla's out with her mom, I wanna eat all my favorite foods one last time. I can't give 'em up without saying goodbye. They made me who I am. Will you help me, bros? One final scarf down before the buffet closes?

Mordecai: Sure, dude./Rigby: We'll help./HFG: No problem.

Muscle Man: (takes off his shirt and twirls it in the air) WHOO! (goes up to the bowl of chips and eats some in a very sloppy way) See you tommorrow, grandmas! (He leaves.)

Rigby: (to Mordecai and HFG) You want anymore of these?

HFG: Nah.

Mordecai: No, I'm good.

(The next scene takes place in Muscle Man's trailer the next day. Muscle Man has a map laid out with restaurants on it.)

Muscle Man: Alright bros, it took me all night, but I finally figured it out. Here on this map you can see all the best food joints in the city. Grill  Em Up, Death Kwon Do, Wing Kingdom, and finally Hot buns.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hot buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuns.

Rigby: THAT'S THE BEST DOGGERY IN TOWN!

Muscle Man: YOU KNOW IT, BRO! Fives will drive us cause he's skilled with his hand. (High fives HFG). You dudes are gonna come along with me for moral support and talk to Starla if she calls. I'm not gonna lie to her about cheating on this diet, but I don't care if you do.

Mordecai: AW, WHAT!?! How's that any different than...

Muscle Man: (Hands the phone to Mordecai) It's ringing, bro!

Mordecai: (Takes the phone) hello?

Starla: Oh, hey, Mordecai. Can I talk to Muscle Man?

Mordecai: Muscle Man can't talk right now, he's outside doing...(sees Muscle Man eating whipped cream)... leg lifts?

Starla: (Impressed) WOW, REALLY!?! Can you tell him I can't wait to get a hold of his ripped glutes?

Mordecai: (Uncomfortable) Yeah, uh-huh, maybe, bye. (He hangs up the phone and sighs.)

Muscle Man:Alright, bros. LET'S DO THIS!

(After a toast of cream soda, a montage starts of Muscle Man and the guys going to several restaurants on the map. Finally they stop at Hot Buns.)

Muscle Man: Well bros, here we are. The final stop. One more Hot Buns hot dog and I'll be ready to start that diet.

Mordecai: (Looking around at all the people) Wow, it's even more crowded than usual.

(Muscle Man goes up to the employee.)

Employee: Hey, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: Yo, Marty! How is it going bro?!

Muscle Man: One of your delicious hot dogs, please?

Marty: No can do bro.

Muscle Man: What?

Marty: We need all our hot dogs for the hot dog eating contest.

Muscle Man: Come on man, one hot dog? For me?

Marty: My hands are tight man. The only way to get one of our dogs today is to join the contest.

Muscle Man: (Determined) Well then sign me up, bro!

Marty: Here you go!

(The employee hands him a sheet which he signs his name on.)

Muscle Man: Ah, my last delicious meal.

(Evil laughter is heard and Death comes out riding on a motorcycle.)

Death: More like "your delicious last meal."

(The gang gasps.)

Mordecai: Death?! What are you doing here?

Death: Boy! You guys really are fools. Don't you remember?

(Flashback to the events of Dead at Eight.)

Death: So don't expect it to be so easy to get one of your souls back next time! Which will be soon, what with Muscle Man entering that hot dog eating contest.

(Muscle Man, Mordecai and Rigby laugh as if Death was only joking.)

Death: (Serious tone) Seriously, you're gonna die in a hot dog eating contest.

(Back to the present...)

Muscle Man: But I just wanted one more hot dog before getting healthy for Starla. I'm not a real entrant in the contest!

Death: Oh yeah? (shows the top of the paper which says "Sign up sheet for real contest entrants" then throws the paper back at Muscle Man) Your reading skills are rubbish!

Muscle Man: (worried) I never should've done this!

Mordecai: (To Muscle Man) It's a plain piece of paper, dude. Just don't participate.

Death: He has to participate!  If he doesn't, (Holds up his axe) then I'll just take his soul right now!

Rigby: (Defending Muscle Man) No way! You don't just get to take people's souls if they haven't done anything! You're just jealous of Muscle Man livin' his life! Muscle Man's lived more life in one day than you have in a thousand years!

Death: (Protesting) What!?! I do too live life! I live all kinds of life!

Rigby: (Scoffs) Listen to this guy. (Imitating Death) "I've got so much life." (Normal voice) He's probably never even had the guts to enter a hot dog eating competition.

Death: (Protesting) Not true! I'm all about competitive eating! I ain't lost a hot dog eating contest since Muscle Man's hairstyle was a legitimate fashion statement!

Rigby: (Teasingly) Was that before or after your skin started looking like grated Parmesan?

All 3: (As Muscle Man bursts out laughing) Ooohhh! Parmesan skin!

Death: (Enraged) Give me that! (Signs his name on the paper) If I win this contest, Muscle Mans' soul is mine!

Mordecai: Fine, but if Muscle Man wins, he doesn't die!

Death: Which isn't very likely, seeing as Muscle Mans' stomach's is almost full. Catch you gents on the flip side. (Puts his ax against Muscle Mans' throat) Flip side of the ground that is. (He walks away laughing evilly.)

Muscle Man: My stomach fears no reaper, bro! YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

(Transitions to the hot dog eating contest)

Referee (Marty): Welcome to the annual Hot Buns hot dog eating contest! Whoever eats the most dogs within 10 minutes wins! And remember, if you can't hold down what you put in your mouth you are disqualified!

Death: (To Muscle Man) Hope you're hungry.

Muscle Man: (Moans nervously)

Referee (Marty): Ready? CHOW DOWN!

(Muscle Man and Death start eating as many hot dogs as they can, Death's pretty much cheating by using his magic powers to stuff the hot dogs in his mouth. Muscle Man's having a hard time eating the hot dogs. Muscle Mans' phone rings and Mordecai answers it)

Mordecai: Hello.

Starla: Hey, Mordecai. How's my wing king doing?

Mordecai: (Lies to Starla) Uh, good.

Starla: Tell him I'm making us a healthy dinner.

Muscle Man: (Weakly) Is that Starla? Let me talk to her!

Mordecai: (Covers the speaker on the phone) But you told me to cover for you!

Muscle Man: (Weakly) This is it, I'm not gonna go out on a lie. NOW GIVE ME THE PHONE!

(Mordecai hands the phone to Muscle Man.)

Muscle Man: (On the phone with Starla) Babe, listen up, I've got something important to tell you, and you're not gonna like it.

Starla: (Suspiciously) Okay?

Muscle Man: I know I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I'm in a hot dog eating contest with Death and I'm about to lose.

Starla: (Furious) WHAT!?!

Muscle Man: I've only got a few minutes left and I just wanted you to know, I love you!

Starla: (Calm tone) Don"t you give up, Mitch! Hang on! (To her mother) Stop the car, Mom! My man needs me!

(Starla's mom gets out of the car and waves to Starla as she drives away to go help Muscle Man. At the contest Death's laughing evilly and uses his magic to summon a tornado while Muscle Man groans. Starla drives through the crowd honking the horn on the car.)

Muscle Man: (Weakly) huh?

Starla: Mitch!

Muscle Man: (Weakly) Starla! (He falls down.)

Starla: (Runs up on the stage) MITCH! (Muscle Man's very weak at this point which worries Starla.) You can't die!

Muscle Man: I'm sorry, babe! I'm sorry I lied to you and hurt you like this. (Time whining) Even if I had to eat wheat germ for the rest of my life, I'd do it if it meant one more day with you. But, I guess in that case, the rest of my life would only be one day, (Turns away from Starla) but... you know what I'm saying.

Starla: (Turns Muscle Man's face around and looks deep into his eyes) OF COURSE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! I ALWAYS KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! That's why I love you with all my heart.

Muscle Man: (Touched) Really, you love me that much?

Starla: Wholly and truly. And because of that I won't let you go without one more taste of your... most... favorite... food.

(Muscle Man and Starla start making out intensely and passionately as the audience watches in disgust. They start spinning around as they continue making out.)

Death: Oh, that's disgusting!

Rigby: Are people allowed to do that to each other?

Death: (Queasy) I don't feel so... (pukes)

Referee (Marty): DISQUALIFIED!

(The audience cheers for Muscle Man because he won the contest.)

Death: (About Muscle Man and Starla) WELL, WHO WOULDN'T GET SICK!?! AREN'T YOU SEEING THIS!?!

(As the tornado disappears, all the hot dogs that were floating in the air falls and the audience except Mordecai, Rigby and HFG leave in disgust.)

(Death begins to leave and Marty makes fun of him as he passes by.)

Marty: Hey loser! Here's your complimentary shirt, you loser! (Holding up a T-shirt that says "I GOT DOGGED AT THE HOT BUNS DOGGERY" while laughing mockingly at Death.)

Death: (Furiously) You better enjoy the next few days, cause your deadline just got moved up, BIG TIME!

(Death leaves on his motorcycle as the back tire splashes mud onto the countertop, Marty, and the shirt he's holding.)

(Scene changes to Muscle Man and Starla on the stage talking about their diet.)

Muscle Man: Thanks for coming, Starla. None of those dogs can match my fun bun. I'll eat that wheat germ if it makes you happy.

Starla: Didn't I tell you? I got us Wing Kingdom brand wheat germ. It's southeast Asian Buffalo Ranch.

Muscle Man: No one gets me like you do, babe. (He starts making out with Starla again.)

(Mordecai, Rigby and HFG are standing there watching.)

Rigby: (To Mordecai) You think we should tell Muscle Man there's a hot dog sticking out of his pocket?

Mordecai: (To Rigby) Nah, he'll figure it out.

(The episode starts off with a flashback of what happened in "Steak Me Amadeus")

Margaret: I got into my dream school. (Mordecai is shocked by this.) I really like you Mordecai, and what we have is special, but I may never get this opportunity again. (She starts crying.) I'm sorry, but... I can't be your girlfriend. (The scene shows Margaret running through the restaurant crying, and Mordecai is left heartbroken. Then it rewinds back to the last sentences Margaret said.) I can't be your girlfriend. (echos) Girlfriend...girlfriend...girlfriend.

(The next scene shows Mordecai all depressed in his bed and he groans. Then it shows Rigby, Benson, Pops and Skips watching him. Benson wanted to say something to him, but Rigby stops him so he can just let Mordecai be alone then the next day, it shows Mordecai looking out the Coffee Shop's window and shows that it is very busy and Eileen is serving everyone their orders, then Eileen serves a coffee to a girl that looks like Margaret from the back, and Mordecai is surprised thinking that she came back, but when she turns around it was not Margaret, then Mordecai gets depressed again and walks away, then it shows Rigby playing video games and Mordecai drops his controler, Rigby notices and picks up Mordecai's controler then he continues playing, but Mordecai drops it again and cries, then it shows Mordecai reading, but he sees other couples including Muscle Man and Starla and Mordecai throws his book on the ground and walks away, then it shows Mordecai in his room and he looks at the sky and sees a constellation that looks just like Margaret, then the rest of the gang comes in and try to cheer Mordecai up because they can't stand to see Mordecai all sad in his room in the dark, the next scene shows the gang at the bowling alley and Rigby gives Mordecai a soda and Skips places his hand on Mordecai's shoulder showing he cares, smiling and Mordecai smiles back, then it shows Muscle Man cheering Mordecai up by making fun of Thomas and they all laugh at it, then it shows Mordecai lifting weights at Skips place along with Pops helping him out, then it shows Mordecai in the bathroom washing his face and shaving with Muscle Man watching while he eats a piece of pie, then it shows Mordecai taking out the trash and working up a sweat and Benson gives him a thumbs up, then it shows Mordecai and Rigby playing video games again, and Mordecai beats him and cheering and Rigby smiles, then Mordecai punches him and continues being happy as he can be.)

(The next scene shows Mordecai and Rigby doing laundry)

Rigby: Man, laundry takes forever.

Mordecai: You know, this would be faster if you helped out.

Rigby: Nah, man, you got this. (He takes a sip of his soda) Besides, all you got left is one sweater. (Mordecai picks up the sweater) One...pink...sweater. (Mordecai looks at it, and gets shocked) Oh, no. (Rigby drops his soda and Mordecai backs up) Don't do anything you're gonna regret. DON'T DO IT! (Mordecai sniffs the sweater and all the memories of Mordecai and Margaret together are shown.) Dude, no! What do you think you're doing?!

Mordecai: Margaret's sweater. She left it here for me to find. I have to give it back to her.

Rigby: No, you don't! She probably has tons of these things, chicks love holding clothes, it's a fact. Besides, it's not even that cold out.

Mordecai: Yeah, but what if it's her favorite sweater?

Rigby: Come on, if she really liked it, she wouldn't have left it.

Mordecai: No, dude, I gotta give it back to her.

Rigby: I don't know. I don't think that's such a good idea.

Mordecai: I'll just mail it.

Rigby: Uh... I guess mailing its okay.

(Rigby hands the sweater back to Mordecai)

Mordecai: Yeah, it's gonna be fine. (The next scene shows Rigby playing video games and Mordecai is writing a letter) Dear Margaret, Hmm-hmm-hmm. Ugh! No. Ugh! (Mordecai rips off the sheet of paper, crumbles it and throws right at Rigby) Hm, oh! I found your sweater, and it still smells like you, even though I washed it. Ugh! Weird, weird. This isn't working. It would be easier if I just give it to her by myself.

Rigby: Dude, you want to go see her? You just got over her. If you see her now, you'll just be (in a dull voice) depressed Mordecai again. (in normal voice) That guy's lame. That guy's the worst.

Mordecai: Hey, I'm just giving her back the sweater.

Rigby: It's a bad idea, dude.

Mordecai: I'm fine.

Rigby: Fine! You can't even write her a stupid letter, how is seeing her going to be better?

Mordecai: Whatever man, I'm just not good at writing letters. Don't worry about it. (Mordecai leaves, then Rigby puts the sweater in a box and writes on it, but then Mordecai comes back) What are you doing? (Rigby runs off with the box) Dude! (Mordecai chases after him and Rigby puts the box in the mailbox) Wait!

Rigby: Hmm-hmm!

Mordecai: I can't believe you did that. I would've mailed it.

Rigby: Sure you would've.

(Knock on the door and the postman at the door.)

Postman: If I can't read it, I can't send it.

(The box is shown to have scribbles on it)

Rigby: Come on, that's perfectly clear. (The postman gives the box) Aw, man. Hey, where you goin'?

Mordecai: I'm just going to re-address this to the post office.

Rigby: Wait, so you're just going to take this to the post office? Yourself?

Mordecai: Mm-hm.

Rigby: For real?

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (Rigby looks at him suspiciously) Yeah, mm-hm, yeah. (They walk up to Muscle Man) Hey Muscle Man, can I borrow your car? I got something I gotta take care of.

Muscle Man: Geez, at this rate, you might as well buy it if you keep borrowing it so much. (He takes a bite out of his chicken leg)

Mordecai: It'll be real quick. Come on.

Muscle Man: Fine. But make sure you take your laundry out of it this time, bro. Unlike some people, I like keeping my things nice. (He wipes off grease on his chest and throws Mordecai his car keys)

Mordecai: Thanks. (He gets inside the car, along with Rigby) What are you doing?

Rigby: What? I just thought you might want some company to the post office. It can get pretty boring, you know, at the post office.

Mordecai: Uh yeah, yep.

(They drive around and Rigby keeps suspiciously looking at Mordecai, but Mordecai passses the post office)

Rigby: Dude, you just passed it!

Mordecai: I'm looking for parking.

(Short pause)

Rigby: We're going to her college, are we?

Mordecai: Yes.

Rigby: You're gonna drive twenty hours to return a sweater?! She probably doesn't know it's missing.

Mordecai: Look, it's her sweater. She should have it back.

Rigby: The sweater doesn't even matter, you're just making excuses.

Mordecai: What? No.

Rigby: Oh yeah. Then I guess it doesn't matter if I do this.

(Rigby opens a window and throws the sweater out the window and Mordecai gets surprised by this and tries to turn back but a car is in his way)

Mordecai: Why did you do that?! What's your problem, man?

Rigby: I'm not the one with the problem. That sweater is messing with your head.

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

Rigby: Just forget it. That sweater's gone, and it's never coming back.

(Then a cop comes by and pulls over Mordecai and Rigby)

Cop: You boys should really be more careful. I've seen too many good clothes lost in this highway, and this is one quality sweater. It's at least 50 percent cashmere. Plus, it smells really good. I'm glad I got a hold of it before it was too late. Here you go, sir. Take good care of this beauty. (He drives away)

Rigby: Ugh!

Mordecai: Dude, I have to give this sweater to her now. This is a sign.

Rigby: This is dumb! You can't drive twenty hours straight by yourself.

Mordecai: Well I'm going too. Because it's fate. (He puts the sweater in the back seat)

Rigby: Ugh! (It shows a montage of them driving on the road with Rigby starting to fall asleep and Mordecai drinking lots of coffee. Then at night, Rigby is seen sleeping and Mordecai looking messed up and tired. Then the next morning, Mordecai starts to fall asleep and starts to be far off the road. Rigby wakes up and notices) Whoa! Dude, dude, the road! (Mordecai wakes up and gets back on the road) Dude, what the heck? Have you been driving all night? You look awful.

Mordecai: It's fine, it's fine. I just gotta give Margaret back the sweater. Almost there.

Rigby: (furious) Fine? Fine?! Not fine. (rapping) Not fine, not fine. You've been driving all this time, your eyes, they must be blind.

Mordecai: (annoyed) Cut it out.

Rigby: (still rapping) Not fine, not fine. How can you say you're fine? Thinking bout the sweater, gotta pull yourself together. This plan would only hurt, you can never make it work!

Mordecai: (irritated) Rigby! Quit it!

Rigby: (still rapping) Not fine, not fine. You're anything but fine. Ditch that stupid sweater, you should be moving on! The past is in the past, you and Margaret said so long!

Mordecai: (finally loses it and elbows Rigby) I said cut it out! Why are so against me giving Margaret her sweater back?

Rigby: 'Cause it's not about the sweater, and you know it. You gotta forget about Margaret.

Mordecai: Dude, Margaret's important to me. I can't just forget her.

Rigby: Okay, okay. You don't have to forget her, but you have to get over her for real. Staying like this is messed up, and is messing you up. I want my friend back.

Mordecai: Well, if you were a real friend, you would understand.

Rigby: I am your friend. (sternly) You'd realize it if you weren't such a sad sack chump!

Mordecai: (enraged) That's it!

(Enraged that Rigby called him "sad sack chump", Mordecai stops the car and pushes Rigby out of the car and drives away)

Rigby: (dismayed) Ah, man!

(Rigby sighs and starts running after him)

Mordecai: Stupid Rigby. Why can't he just back me up? I'm just trying to get her sweater back. Right?

(Suddenly, Margaret's sweater comes to life and reveals a red aura that looks just like Margaret)

Margaret's Sweater: Of course. Of course you are, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Huh?

Margaret's Sweater: You're just trying to do the right thing. I understand completely.

Mordecai: Ah. I knew you would. But why can't Rigby? I know he means well. Maybe I shouldn't have kicked them out. I should go back and get him. If you talked to him, he'll understand.

Margaret's Sweater: Now, now. There's no need for that. The sweater's the only thing that matters. Forget Rigby.

Mordecai: Forget Rigby?

Margaret's Sweater: He'll never understand. He'll only get in the way.

Mordecai: But...

Margaret's Sweater: The sooner you give Margaret the sweater, the sooner she'll quit school and be with you. The two of you will be happy forever.

Mordecai: That's not true. Margaret worked really hard to get to school. She wouldn't just quit.

Margaret's Sweater: FOOL! (She wraps around her arm to Mordecai's arm)

Mordecai: What are you doing?!

Margaret's Sweater: What needs to be done. She has to have her sweater back, Mordecai.

(Mordecai struggles to turn around but the sweater prevents)

Mordecai: Ahh! Get off of me! (The sweater hisses at him and wraps her arm around Mordecai's leg and starts to speed up) You can't make me do this. (He pulls the stick but the sweater pushes him back)

Margaret's Sweater: Return the sweater! You can't fight it! Just think how happy she'll be. How happy you'll be.

Mordecai: No! Rigby was right, I shouldn't be doing this. I need to get over Margaret!

College Guy 1: Yeah! Vegans need to eat, too.

(They head straight to Milton University and they almost run into everybody)

College Guy 2: Uh, so I guess Williams Hall would be over here?

(Mordecai almost runs into the guy and crashes into the statue then he notices all the laundry in the front)

Mordecai: What the...?

College Guy 3: WHOOOO! Hope you came to college so you can learn how to drive.

Margaret: (off-screen) Yeah, are you guys excited for that guest speaker tomorrow?

Mordecai: Margaret?

College Guy 4: Oh, definitely.

College Girl: For sure.

Margaret: Yeah, it's just so cool that we get to access that kind of experience here, you know?

College Guy 4: Yeah, you won't find that everywhere.

(Mordecai tries to walk up to her, but he stops for a moment.)

Margaret: I wrote down some questions to ask after the lecture.

College Guy 4: Yeah, we'll see, if you don't chicken out this time.

Margaret: Oh, come on. One time that happened. (Mordecai stands there watching Margaret and he throws the sweater in the trash can. Margaret notices something and moves her gaze to the trash can, but Mordecai was no longer there.) So you guys want to head over to the quad?

(Rigby comes back and is completely exhausted and out of breath.)

Rigby: D...don't....Morde...cai....don't... swea....sweater....stop.

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. I didn't give it to her.

Rigby: Ah.

Mordecai: You were right to try and stop me.

Rigby: Yeah, I know.

Mordecai: Sorry for kicking you out of the car.

Rigby: It's okay. Sorry for calling you a sad sack chump.

Mordecai: No, Depressed Mordecai is a chump. Let's go home. Do you think Muscle Man will notice we messed up his car?

Rigby: Nah, it pretty much looks the same.

(The statue crashes down Muscle Man's car)

(The End)

(We begin with the Park entrance. Then we are shown Mordecai and Rigby hosing the grass.)

Rigby: And then I'll live in a mansion with fast internet.

Mordecai: How fast?

Rigby: Faster than you!

(Rigby sprays at his legs.)

Mordecai: Whoa! Haha! Watch it!

(CJ comes driving in her car.)

CJ: Beep beep! Yo! My horn is broken, let's go! BEEEEEP!

Mordecai: Oh, CJ's here early. Hey, can you cover for me so we can go hang out?

Rigby: Sure, man.

(He takes Mordecai's hose.)

Mordecai: Cool.

(He waves and walks off.)

Rigby: Double fisted!

(He makes shooting sounds while spraying with the hoses. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby picking up garbage.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab!

Mordecai: Oh, hey man. Sorry about this. I'm taking CJ to see that Swedish movie with the crying, so....

Rigby: Oh, okay. Well, have fun.

(Mordecai gives Rigby his garbage picker and runs off.)

Mordecai: I probably won't. It's pretty cerebral and really sad!

(Rigby goes back to picking rubbish.)

Rigby: Stab. Stab.

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby wiping the windows.)

Mordecai:  Hey, uh, sorry, but....

Rigby: Yeah, yeah, I got it.

(Mordecai gives him his napkin.)

Mordecai: Great!

(He leaves.)

Rigby: Wipe, wipe, wipe!

(Cut to Benson taking to Rigby, Muscle Man, Fives, Pops and Skips.)

Benson: So, if anyone has any leads on this issue, there is a $12 reward.

(Mordecai goes to him.)

Benson: Oh, maybe Mordecai has some insight on who's been wrapping the public toilet seats with plastic wrap.

Mordecai: Sorry I'm late. I was moving CJ's couch.

Muscle Man: Oh ho ho! I guess CJ's the remote in that relationship, because she's the one with all the control! Does anyone want me to explain? Do we get it?

Benson: We get it.

Pops: I'm afraid I don't quite-

Benson: We get it! (to Mordecai) It's a good thing you're here. I'm gonna need you to help Rigby change the lightbulbs.

Rigby: Oh, I can do that myself.

Benson (sarcastically): Ha ha. Yeah, sure you can.

Rigby: Yeah, I can! I help all the time!

(Everyone laughs.)

Rigby (continued): Why are you laughing?!

Muscle Man: Bro, without Mordecai, you'd be totally useless.

Rigby: Wha- Come on, Mordecai, tell him how useful I am.

Mordecai: Uhh...yeah, I mean, you're fun.

Rigby: What? No, tell him I'm useful!

Mordecai: Yeah, you're my friend.

Rigby: Why aren't you saying the word useful?!

Mordecai: Well, I mean there was the time with the chairs, the limousine, the pretzel. You're basically the opposite of useful pretty much anytime we do anything.

Rigby: But we did those things together!

Mordecai: Yeah, I mean, you were there.

Rigby: So the whole time I've been covering for you and CJ?

Mordecai: Well, I mean, it's the least you could do.

Rigby: The least...I could.....I quit.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: I quit! I can get a paycheck anywhere!

(Everyone laughs at Rigby again.)

Mordecai: Dude, you can't get a job without me. It's my references that got you this job in the first place.

Rigby: Reference this! I'm gonna go out and get a job, and I'm gonna make money at that job. and that money's gonna come in the form of a check. And that check's gonna be in an envelope, and the envelope's gonna be sealed, and I'm gonna rub that sealed envelope all up in your face, Mordecai! PEACE!

(Rigby makes a raspberry noise from the park all the way to the Local Temp Agency.)

Rigby: Do you have any openings for someone who wants to rub something in his friend's face?

Lady: Oh sure, we have a variety of positions for anyone with a college diploma.

Rigby: I never went to college.

Lady: (puts away some documents) Well there's still some for high school graduates.

Rigby: I never graduated high school.

Lady: (puts away a large stack of documents) Well, as long as you have a drivers license. (Rigby remains silent.)

Lady: (puts away the last stack of documents) Well...there is this one.....

Rigby: As long as I'm getting a paycheck I'm doing it!

Lady: Alright. (gives Rigby a card)

Rigby: Hmmmm..... (looks at the "Lift with your back" card)

(At the Lift With Your Back Co)

Manny: The name's Manny, this here's my moving company, I built it with my back up! We got everything you need here. Cardboard boxes, packing peanuts, packing tape..... Turn around.

Rigby: What?

(Manny twirls his finger, Rigby turns around, showing his single buttcheek.)

Manny: Hmmm.... you only got one butt cheek, you don't have much of a back on you. But we need as many backs as we can get for this next job.

Rigby: Okay? What should I do?

Manny: Just load up on the back of that truck with the other flunkies.

(Rigby enters the back of the truck, one of the guys closes the back.)

(At the outside of someone's house)

Manny: Alright you crum-bums! We got a seven bedroom doghouse we gotta move in an hour! I don't want to hear any of your backtalk out of you backblisters, or you're back on the street! Now keep up the good work! I respect the heck out of ya!

(Rigby lifts one of the boxes)

Manny: Whoa there in your back! What do you think you're doing? You gotta lift with your back!

Rigby: What? Really?

Manny: We are called "Lift with your back" for a reason. Are you trying to ruin my brand? Let me show you how it's done kid.

(Manny removes his shirt and lifts the box, revealing a six pack on his back.)

Rigby: Eughhh! uhh....

(Rigby sees other workers, they too have abs on their back.)

Manny: You want that paycheck? Lift with your back!

Rigby: Uhhh.... (he lifts a box and walks at the front door)

Manny: C'mon what are you doing kid? Don't use the front door! Use the back door!

Rigby: But it's twice as far!

Manny: What are you trying to ruin my brand? Get back there!

(Rigby grumbles, and then lives the box and walks to the back door.)

Manny: Hm. That kid's got heart.

(At night, Rigby tiredly walks towards his bed, and lies his head in it)

Mordecai: Oh, there you are! I knew you were faking earlier.

Rigby: Faking? HA! Does this look like the back of a faker? (Shows his back)

Mordecai: (ignores his back) Look, I need you to cover for me again. CJ's half birthday party is tomorrow and it's pretty important.

Rigby: What? Are you serious?!

Mordecai: Yeah, C'mon man! You slacked off your whole life! Can I just have this?

Rigby: No! You have things all the time! Player 1, the bed, punchies, a diploma, a girlfriend?!

Mordecai: Oh Jeez, is this what this is about? You not liking CJ?

Rigby: No, CJ is cool! But I helped you all the time with her. And I helped you get with and over Margaret! And you never even thanked me!

Mordecai: Of course I did! I think I did?

Rigby: 4 days Mordecai, 4 days till I rub that paycheck all up in your sorry face!

(Benson walks in)

Benson: Oh, uh, Rigby. You're still here. *clears throat* As you know, room and board is for employees only, and we kinda need the space for this old dot matrix printer.

(Skips pushes in a dot matrix printer. Rigby shakes and sheds a tear)

Rigby: FINE! MAYBE I'LL STAY IN A FOUR-STAR HOTEL! WITH A POOL!

Benson: Oh, with the paycheck you earned, in the sealed envelope?

Rigby: Yes, in the sealed envelope!

(Lift with your back truck seen beside the four-star hotel)

Rigby:. Huh, four more days.

Manny: Your back, you gotta use your back!

(Rigby walks into the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: Ah, my back!

Eileen: How was Day Two?

Rigby: All this back-breaking labor is killing my back. I don't know if I can live with my back all week. Maybe I should just take my old job back.

(Eileen massages his back.)

Eileen: Why do you keep saying "back"?

Rigby: It's all I hear all day!

Eileen: I don't mean to sound harsh, but this seems like a toxic work environment. Your back's all mangled and ropey.

(Eileen cracks Rigby's back.)

Rigby: Thanks- OW!

Eileen: Quit squirming. Doesn't your boss know to lift with your legs? That's-- That's, like, Hauling and Packing 101!

Rigby: Yeah, I don't know what his deal is, but he keeps saying I've got heart or something.

Eileen: Then that's the one thing upon which we agree. You've got heart, Rigby, and in three days, you'll have a paycheck too.

(Rigby smiles)

Rigby: Can I get a cup of coffee?

Eileen: You got $1.50?

(Cuts to Rigby at work)

Manny: Now, today's gonna be a big day, and some of you schnooks are looking a little back-bottomed, so I'm gonna play the company song to get your backs on track!

(Music plays, Rigby is lifting more boxes, and the other three workers are shown to be impressed. Rigby is later shown in a truck, marking the third day off. Next day, Eileen is shown massaging Rigby's back, when Mordecai calls him on his phone. Rigby throws his phone into an opened box labeled "trash cans". Rigby continues to lift even more boxes. Eileen looks at Rigby, worried. Rigby in the truck again, circling the dollar sign, indicating it's payday.)

Manny: Alright, you pickle pouches, time for your back pay! Joe! Murray! Rorschach! Rigby!(lifts the letter higher) Ah!

Rigby: Hey, what the heck man?! I've been doing your lame back stuff all week! Now pay up!

Manny: Oh, you'll get your paycheck.

(Manny folds the letter into a plane, puts it on his back, and launches it all the way back in a loaded truck.)

Rigby: Hey, what gives?!

Manny: Tell him Murray.

Murray: Hello, Rigby.

Rigby: Murray.

Murray: It's kind of company tradition that on your first paycheck, you got to move a full truck by yourself.

Rigby: What?! Are you serious?!

Manny: Hey, my back is tied. You want the paycheck, you move the boxes!

(Rigby grumbles, and walks to the loaded truck, and surprised by the amount of boxes he has to move. A cart approaches Rigby, with Eileen and Mordecai sitting in it, they walk towards Rigby.)

Rigby: Ugh! Eileen, why'd you bring that guy here?

Eileen: 'Cause you guys are friends, and you always support each other.

Mordecai: Dude, come on, you don't have to go through all this to prove a point. You got to stop, man. Let me help.

Rigby: No, I'm doing it myself!

Mordecai: You're just gonna hurt your back, dude!

Rigby: Can't be worse than when you stabbed it!

Mordecai: What? Come on.

Rigby: You think the only thing I'm useful for is being your chump! (imitates Mordecai) "Rigby, help me get a girlfriend!", "Let me borrow your time machine, Rigby!", "Rigby, I found a dumb sweater, and I got to return it!". All you do is use me, man.

Mordecai: But I never asked you to do those things.

Rigby: Of course you didn't! (sighs) I helped 'cause you're my friend.

Mordecai: Then let me help you.

Rigby: No! This is my job, and I gotta unload this truck.

(Rigby walks back into the moving truck and picks up his first box. The abs on his back start growing, freaking out Mordecai and Eileen. Rigby keeps gasping for breath as Manny laughs, but a determined Rigby continues to unload the truck. Rigby then sees his next box is filled with sand, and when he goes to lift it, something cracks inside him. Manny nods his head at Rigby, when Murray walks up to him)

Murray: You gotta stop this, boss. You're killing him!

(Manny slaps Murray in the face, and grabs his shirt)

Manny: He's making me proud out there. I love that kid like he was my own flesh and back.

(Rigby throws the sand box onto the ground. He takes a sigh of relief before turning to see his final box, filled with cast-iron sand. His paycheck is in the back of the box. Determined, Rigby runs over and goes to lift the box, struggling. He can't seem to get it off the ground)

Mordecai: Rigby! Stop! You're never gonna walk again!

(Rigby continues to try and lift the box, straining his muscles)

Eileen: Rigby, enough of this! I know you're useful, now lift with your back so you can get that paycheck!

(Rigby starts to lift the box from the bottom, with his back. A six pack is suddenly formed on his back, almost possessing Rigby, as he finally carries the box out of the truck)

Everyone: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

(Everybody gasps as Rigby reaches the end of the truck, and he chucks the box onto the ground. Everyone cheers for him as his paycheck floats down into his hand. Rigby loses his possession and starts to deflate as he holds the check. Murray walks over to him)

Murray: Rigby, you're the worst worker I've ever had, and you're like a son to me.

Rigby: I...quit...I'm going back to my real job.

(Murray seems sad)

Murray: You'll...you'll be back!

(Murray walks off, as Mordecai and Eileen walk in)

Mordecai: That was so awesome, dude! You were all like -

(Mordecai does an impression of Rigby lifting the box)

Rigby: Hehe, yeah. But did you see when I was like -

(Rigby does an impression of himself throwing the box onto the ground. They both continue to make impressions, as Eileen watches them. Mordecai and Rigby both laugh)

Mordecai: But seriously, dude. I was taking you for granted, thanks for helping me all the time.

Eileen: So the conflict's been mediated?

Rigby: I just gotta do one more thing...

Mordecai: What's that?

(Rigby very weakly stands up and tries to rub the paycheck in Mordecai's face)

Rigby: In your faaaaa-faaaa-

Mordecai: Do you need some help, dude?

(End of Lift With Your Back)
(Episode begins outside the park house with Mr. Maellard's limousine)

Benson: Alright, Mr. Maellard gets back from vacation today, so I need you guys to clean the limousine.

Rigby: Why don't we just wait 'till it rains? That's how I clean myself.

Benson: (Brief glare at Rigby) I want it looking as good as new when he comes in this afternoon. That means washed, waxed, and detailed. Got it?

Rigby: Yeah, yeah, we got it.

Mordecai: So, where are the keys?

(Benson has the keys in his hand)

Benson: Oh, you mean these keys?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Benson: Oh, no. I'll be holding onto these.

Rigby: Aw, what?! How are we gonna listen to the radio then?

Benson: Your job isn't listening the radio. It's to clean the car! (Turns red) DO IT BEFORE MR. MAELLARD GETS BACK OR YOU'RE FIRED!!

Rigby: GreatNo radio. This is gonna be so boring!

(Rigby opens a limo door, and club music begins playing. The scene shows the inside of Maellard's limo with couches, a polar bear mat, a refrigerator, plasma TV screens, a sink, a telephone, and a back seat)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whooooa!

Mordecai: Dude, you know what's not boring? Limousine Lunch Time'!

(Mordecai takes out a bag, and the duo goes inside the limo)

Rigby: Yeah, now we're talking!

(Mordecai takes out two meatball subs from the bag)

Mordecai: Meatball suuub!

Rigby: Meatball suuub!

(Rigby chews on his meatball sub with dramatic music playing, and one of the meatballs falls out of his sub in slow motion)

Rigby: (In slow motion)  Aaaaah!

Mordecai: (In slow motion) Noooooooo!

(Mordecai tries catching the meatball, but it falls onto the seat before he can get to it and splatters)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: Stay cool, man! It's just one meatball. Oh!

(Rigby grabs the meatball that fell, but it slips out of his hand in slow motion and hits Mordecai in his eye)

Mordecai: Ugh! My eyeball!

Rigby: (Grunts) Whooooa!

(The duo's subs fall out of their hands and land onto the seat. Once they see the mess, they scream. The next scene shows Mordecai trying to wash the stain off.)

Mordecai: Agh! It's still there!

Rigby: Don't worry, dudeI got it. This is my mom's special cleaning formula. (Rigby pours soda and vinegar into the cleaning bucket) Club soda, vinegar, and some elbow greeease! (Rigby starts washing out the stain, but it wouldnt come off) By the power of my mom, stain be gone!

Mordecai: Hmm, maybe that's why the house is never clean. (Groans) We're so fired!

Rigby: Hey man, it could be worse. (Sees the meat sauce on his hand dripping onto the floor) Huh?

Mordecai: (Gasps) Dude!

Rigby: I'm sorry! I didn't know I had it on me! (Rigby slips on the meat sauce and falls onto the floor. The meat sauce splattered all over the limo) Agh!

Mordecai: Dude, stop moving!

Rigby: (Shouts indistinctly)

(Mordecai grunts and grabs Rigby and they both fell onto the ground, moaning. The limo is now splattered with meat sauce.)

Mordecai: We got to get Skips.

(Scene transitions to Skips examining the stain)

Skips: Huh. Yeah, this is pretty bad. Maellard loves this limo; almost more than he loves Pops.

Rigby: Can you fix it?

Skips: Nope. I know a guy who runs an auto-body shop, though. He could fix it for you.

Mordecai: We got to get the keys from Benson.

Rigby: Aw.

(Scene transitions to a TV, which is playing 'Better Bosses'. Benson is watching it intently. Mordecai and Rigby attempt to get the keys by inserting a stick through a window behind him. They try to make as little noise as possible.) 

Man on TV: The key to being a better boss isdiligence. Keep your eyes peeled. Never lose focus. Act as if your employees are right behind you at all times.

Benson: Poetry.

(Scene transitions outside to an auto-body shop with M and R standing outside with Mr. Maellard's limo)

Mordecai: Hello? Hello?!

(A man named Roger is underneath a car, fixing it)

Roger: We're closed!

Mordecai: But --

Roger: We're closed!

Rigby: This is an emergency! We got a limo!

(The man rolls out of the garage)

Roger: Limo?! (Gets up in their faces) What do you know about limos?! Huh?! (Looks at Maellard's limo) Well, I'll be. What are you boys doing with Mr. Maellard's 'White Stallion'?

Mordecai: You know this car?

Roger: Heh, know it? Heck, I used to drive it!

(Roger pulls out a wallet with many photos of him when he drove the limo)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whooooa!

Roger: Yep, I used to be Mr. Maellard's chauffeur back in the day. The name's Roger. Yep, it was good times driving this carMe and the Stallion cruising the Financial District together. So, what's the trouble with her? (Roger opens the door to the limo and looks at the stains) What is thatPomodoro, Marinara?

Mordecai: Uh, meatball sub.

Roger: Hmm. All right, it won't be easy, but I'll see what I can do. Bring her in!

Mordecai: Thanks so much!

(The duo backs the limo into the garage, but the metal in the back scrapes against a wall)

Mordecai: (Gasps) I-It'll be fine. I'll just adjust it.

(He tries to move the limo' forward, and the metal scrapes again. The duo gets out of the limo and screams.)

Rigby: You can fix this, right?!

Roger: I'm a mechanic, not a magician.

Rigby: Dude, what are we gonna do?! Mr. Maellard's picking up the car in a few hours!

Mordecai: Face it, dude. We can't get out of this one. Let's just take it back.

(The duo sigh)

Roger: Actually, I know a way to get a limo just like this one.

Mordecai and Rigby: How?!

Roger: There's a place where he richest of the rich gatherA secret place where the limos duke it out and the winner gets a brand-new limo. Limo...Demolition...Derby. It's the only way you're gonna get a new limo in time, unless you boys got a million bucks handy.

Rigby: (counts the coins on his hand) How much is a million?

Mordecai: We'll do it.

(The scene changes to the gang driving the limo to the Limo Demolition Derby. The limo stops at a brick wall, with Roger honking the horn, which presumed to be the secret code. The brick wall was revealed to be brick gates, to which it opens and the gang drives the limo inside. The limo then drives into an arena with cheers and applause. Mordecai and Rigby then stick their heads out the roof of the limo.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whooooa!

Man: Welcome to the Limo Demolition Derby, boys!

(There were men dressed in black suits cheering and applauding)

Roger: Don't look into the eyes of the millionaires! Their greed will blind you! (M and R both whimper) Now, the rules are simple, boys. When the ref rules your limo undriveable, you're out. But the last one standing gets to take home the prize limoA brand-new White Stallion!

(Rigby points to the new limo)

Rigby: Dude, there it is!

Mordecai: We have to win it.

Roger: Hang on, fellas! Let's talk strategy first. There's a couple of things you should know before you go out there. One, go for the stretch limo first. It's at a disadvantage 'cause it's too long. Two, if you see a Jeep limo, take out its back wheels. Three, it's a scientific fact that gold limos are heavy. So take it to the mud, and that nugget will sink. You got all that?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uh...

Roger: Of course you do! You two are responsible! Now go out there and win that limo so Maellard doesn't tear you limb from limb!

(Mordecai and Rigby stares at the gold trophy)

Announcer: Chauffeurs, start your engines!

(Cars begin to start their engines)

Announcer: On your mark, get set, go!

(The chauffeurs hit their cars' gas, the man in the blue suit laughs. Unfortunately, the cars bump into each other. The crowd cheers)

Man in the Blue Suit: Aauugh! Every time!

Rigby: Watch out, watch out!

(Mordecai steers, but the cars bumped into Mr. Maellard's limousine which 'Mordecai is driving.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aaaaahhh! (Mordecai and Rigby bump into each other)

Mordecai: Aw, man!

Rigby: Uh, Mordecai, (The man driving the red truck laughs evily and switches to "Death Mode")

Rigby: Dude! (Mordecai tries to pull the gear)

Mordecai: The gear is stuck!

(The red truck hit Mr. Maellard's Limousine into the corner)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aaaahhhh! (The red truck tears Mr. Maellard's limousine. Suddenly the telephone rings. Rigby picks up and answers the phone)

Rigby: Hello?

Roger: Sorry I forgot to tell you, the Stallion's packed with weapons controlled through the glove box. (Rigby opens the glove box full of buttons)

Rigby: And you're just telling us now?

Roger: I said I was sorry.

Rigby: Yeah, yeah.

Roger (Through the phone): Oh, and don't press the red button, it launches the missile. And you only have one, so don't use it until you really need it.

(The tires screech, and the man in the red truck laughs)

Mordecai: Dude, do something!

(Rigby pushes one of the buttons. A machine gun rises through the limousine's roof and lets it rip, popping the truck's tires. The referee flags the red truck)

Mordecai: Rigby, start pressing buttons!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmph hmph hmph hmph! (Mordecai hits the gas, and the truck explodes)

(Rigby pushes a button, releasing spikes causing another tires to pop. Rigby pushes another button, causing the windscreen cleaners to be set off, he flicks some switches that cause missiles to be sent out of the hood, blowing up a limo. Rigby pressing another button causing spikes to come out of one of the wheels, flattening another limo's tires. Another button makes a hook attach itself to a golden limo, which is thrown into a giant mud puddle and drowns. The limo is then seen doing donuts while firing its machine gun. Mordecai and Rigby are the only ones left.)

Mordecai: We...we did it!

Rigby: Dude, we won!

Roger: Haha, yeah!

(The audience start jeering, but then begin chanting)

Audience: Limosaurus...limosaurus...

Roger: Huh?

Audience: Limosaurus, LIMOSAURUS! LIMOSAURUS! LIMOSAURUS! LIMOSAURUS!

(A garage door slowly opens as some loud thuds can be heard)

Mordecai: Dude, why's the ground shaking?

(The limo's phone rings, Rigby answers it)

Roger: Boys, I know I keep forgetting important information, but I promise this is the last thing! To win the final round of the derby, you need to defeat a dinosaur made out of limos!

Rigby: What!?

(The Limosaurus is revealed. It roars, and Mordecai & Rigby scream. The Limosaurus runs towards them)

Rigby: Dude, go go go!

(Mordecai accelerates as the Limosaurus slams its fist down to the ground. The limo goes between the Limosaurus' legs, which the Limosaurus watches, causing it to the ground. The audience gasp)

Rigby: Dude, Limosaurus is down!

Mordecai: Hmph, hmph! More like hunk-of-junk-osaurus!

Mordecai & Rigby: OOHHHH!!!!

(The Limosaurus gets up and breathes fire onto the limo, Mordecai and Rigby scream and run circles around the Limosaurus.

Mordecai: Dude, just press everything!

(Rigby presses all the buttons on the limo's dashboard, including a grappling hook which pulls the Limosaurus to the ground. Rigby starts firing lasers)

Rigby: Pew-pew-pew!

Mordecai: Haha!

(The Limosaurus roars and picks up the limo, causing the duo to scream again. They are flipped upside down and a meatball sub hits Rigby in the face)

Rigby: This is all your fault, meatball sub!

(Rigby throws the sub out of the window, hitting the Limosaurus, causing it to drop the limo. Mordecai and Rigby crash to the ground and groan. The Limosaurus looks at them)

Mordecai: Dude. Press the red button.

(Rigby reaches for the red button, the Limosaurus roars, just as Rigby is able to hit it. The limo splits in half as the two scream, revealing a missile which blows up the Limosaurus' head, killing it. Mordecai and Rigby jump out of the limo, as the audience cheers them on. Roger puts his thumb up to Mordecai and Rigby, who smile. Cut to The Park, Mr. Maellard is back and inspecting the limo)

Mr. Maellard: Hmm...hmmm! Heheh, this looks as good as new! Thank you, Benson, great work.

Benson: Oh, it was no trouble at all. Right, guys?

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh nervously)

Mr. Maellard: Now, on to more pressing matters! Limousine lunchtime.

(Mr. Maellard opens a sandwich in the back of the limo)

Mr. Maellard: Ah, pastrami with extra coleslaw, I've been waiting to eat this the whole plane ride back!

(As Mr. Maellard is about to eat his sandwich, his phone rings)

Mr. Maellard: What? What is it? I'm busy, here!

(The ingredients drop out of the sandwich slowly, shocking Mr. Maellard and scaring Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai & Rigby: No!!!

(The sandwich drops on the chair and splashes over everyone)

Mordecai & Rigby: Agh!

Mr. Maellard: Eugh...I'm rich. I'll just buy another limo.

Rigby: The persecutions!

And then responds with a smiley, ":(" to which Mordecai responds with another, "/", to which Margarita responds again with another, "-_-", to which Mordecai replies with a drawing made with the characters) Wow (said aloud to see the drawing)!

Margarita: I know, I just wanted both the segment that convinced me to believe this information What do I do now?

Eileen: Maybe you can make a simple as a cooking show segment, you prepare a big cake.

Daisy: He said he wanted the "Wow" factor is not the factor "Mm" you know? (pulls out his phone to this sonar) This is weird never had written me before.

Narrator: (reading ".. Got another tip for you THE BIGGEST ONE YET URGENT !!!") I have another report, the bigger this now. Urgent...

Local news producer: But what ...?

Margarita: I know this is weird ... but I believed I have a story.

Employee who I was on the computer: The Short transmission?

Local news producer: No, let 's look to the best with this.

TV (Margarita): We interrupt transmission  with urgent news, reporter of Channel 6, Jackie Carmichael is in a chase ... with me. (The camera focuses on Jackie)

TV (Jackie): What !?

TV (Margarita): I'm being chased by Miss Carmichael, for I am in a position to evidence, which certainly would ruin his career, always dreamed of LOSE MY reporter for the news report to the public, help people, the job of a reporter is bring the truth and not know it for personal gain, why risk everything, to show the truth to the public.

Frank: Resists love ... (runs off)

Narrator: Loading ... 65 percent.

TV (Margarita): What you are about to see are real pictures of Jackie Carmichael giving false evidence and twisting the truth, all for getting the weekly news segment.

(Jackie jumps into the truck Channel 6)

Employee: Oh! This ceiling! Ahh!

TV (Margarita): Ah ... ah ... ah ... ah ... ah I'm being thrown from side to side! What has to tell the driver?

Conductor: I'm fine, I think the launch. Oh, Ahhh! (Jackie takes him by the neck and throws him out)

TV (Margarita): Oy god! Oy god!

(Appears Frank in Helicopter 6)

Frank: Hey Jackie, Report This! (press a button and launches a missile)

(This goes through his chest but this is regenerated)

Frank / Margarita: Ohh!

Producer of local news: If it survives, will have its own weekly segment.

(Jackie enters the truck)

Margaret: Ah ... is that you?

Jackie: A winning reporter for a prize and a robot from the future, Yes! If I am, I was sent to infiltrate and destroy local news, in my time, is the great defect of our utopian society.

Margarita: A defect? News give an important service to the residents of each city.

Jackie: Oh, do not you think that nonsense? or if? newscasts are people reading things internet air, is delaying humanity, if you give me those images would be as if nothing had happened, help me to complete my mission Margarita! Let 's destroy local news and enter into an era of prosperity!

Narrator: Full charge. (reading "Upload Complete") (close your laptop)

Daisy: Hey, take it . (gives it to Jackie) (go down a ladder)

Jackie: You did the right thing ... Margarita Margarita ...? (Margarita is on the ladder)

Margaret: You know Jackie, Margaret always ... Margatrapa the bad.

Jackie: Even I do not love the name. Ahh !! (the van hits the lateral side of a bridge) AHHH !! (The truck explodes)

(Room Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai / Rigby: Rubbish! Trash! Trash! Trash!

(Cafeteria)

Eileen: Well Margarita! Uuh! (spill some coffee)

(Sala transmission)

Producer of Local News: If this is done, we have a segment!

From: We used to go. (you telling who was on your left)

(Room CJ)

(CJ change channels)

(Helicopter 6)

Margarita: I did not know that the helicopter had missiles.

Frank: Well, I ... yeah, we had just one in case something like this to happen, I'm proud of you darling, did you know that Jackie also was a robot?

Margarita: I did not know, really not.

Frank: Well , you did well, of course cameraman died and millions of dollars in damage to roads, but ... you proved that local news is incredible.

(In the rubble of the truck Channel 6, a piece of liquid than it was Jackie is moving and goes)

(Episode begins at Space Tree Station. Mordecai, Rigby, Toothpick Sally, Chance Sureshot and Recap Robot are having lunch at the Food Court. Sureshot sips his coffee and sighs.)

Chance Sureshot: That's darn fine coffee.

Mordecai: It better be. You had like 12 cups.

Chance Sureshot: Only thing that keeps me steady.

(He lifts his hand in a straight pose. Mordecai and Rigby are weirded out.)

Toothpick Sally: You don't wanna see him without it.

Chance Sureshot: Great lunch, guys. This one's on me. You've been training hard out there. You earned it. Oh waiter!

Robot: Food courts do not have waiters.

Chance Sureshot: (chuckles) Yes. Of course. Go ahead and put all this on the company tab.

Robot: Payment is due in full immediately.

Chance Sureshot: Uh... (chuckles) Ow! Okay. Sure. I'll just get the company to reimburse me later. Oh, no... I-I don't have my wallet.

Robot: No wallet.

(The robot puts Sureshot in a force field. Sureshot screams.)

Chance Sureshot: Hey. Come on! Uh, can anyone else cover lunch today so I can get out of this force field?

(Mordecai, Rigby, Sally and Recap all decline. Sureshot groans.)

Chance Sureshot: Alright. My wallet's gotta be somewhere. Let's see...Last night...I definately had it at the space club 'cause I bought the first round of wings. Then I bought the last round of wings. And then...

(He gasps.)

Rigby: What?

Chance Sureshot: I left my wallet back on Mantis Planet. Can you guys go get it for me?

Mordecai: I don't know...It sounds like a planet full of mantises...

Toothpick Sally: Oh, it is.

Chance Sureshot: They're cool, though! I swear! It'll be super easy! Just in and out! Think of it as one of your training exercises.

Toothpick Sally: Ugh. Let's go get his wallet.

Rigby: Can we drive?

Toothpick Sally: Why not?

(She, Mordecai and Rigby leaves the food court. Recap follows them.)

Recap Robot: Oh, fun! Manti love robots!

(Later, in outer space, Mordecai, Rigby, Sally and Recap are heading to Mantis Planet in a space cart.)

Toothpick Sally: We're getting close. Are you forgetting something?

Recap Robot: Oh! Correct!

(He gets out a fake beard and puts it on.)

Rigby: Hey, what's with the beard?

Recap Robot: Oh, this? It is a disguise. I need the manti to believe I'm a human being.

Rigby: Why? I thought you said they love robots.

Recap Robot: They do! In their horror movies! Outside of that, manti actually find robots extremely repulsive.

Mordecai: So...you coming with us isn't going to be a problem, is it?

Recap Robot: I'm quite sure I'll go undetected with this beard. And this baseball cap.

(He puts on a baseball cap that has the words 'I HEART EMOTION' on it. Rigby and Mordecai looks at Sally. Sally grunts.)

Toothpick Sally: As long as we respect all their customs, we'll be fine. Take a left here!

(The cart lands on Mantis Planet. Recap gets out a clipboard.)

Recap Robot: Before we disembark, there are a few cultural rules we should...

Rigby: Cool! Bugs with guns!

(Three mantises wearing uniforms and carrying guns runs towards the quartet.)

Mantis: We have been commanded to escort you to the Great Mountain Throne Room. By decree of the king of Mantalantis.

Mordecai: Woah. The king wants to see us?

Rigby: Are we in trouble or somethin'?

Mantis: Huh? Trou...No! No, no. The king just likes to meet anyone who travels to Mantalantis. Come along, then.

(Mordecai, Rigby and Sally all head into the mountain. Recap follows them, but is then stopped by the mantis.)

Mantis: You're not a robot, are you? I'm...uh...getting kind of a vibe here.

Recap Robot: No, sir. If I were a robot, how could I grow this cool human beard?

Mantis: Hmm...It is a pretty sweet beard. Good coverage, too. Whenever I try it, it's just like...It doesn't really grow on the sides! Of course, it's like a jungle in my thorax, but isn't that always the way?

Recap Robot: I hear that!

Mordecai and Rigby: Mantis King! Mantis King! Mantis King!

(Mordecai, Rigby, Sally and Recap encounter the Mantis King, who is making weird noises.)

Mantis King: *Weird noises*

Rigby: What's he saying?

Mantis King: *Weird noises*

Mordecai: So...do you, like, have a translator or?...

Mantis King: *Weird noises*

Mordecai and Rigby: Uh...

(Eventually, the Mantis King spits out what looked like gum before wrapping it in paper and throwing it onto the ground, allowing his pet to eat it.)

Mantis King: Pardon my gum-chewing. I just wanted to freshen up before meeting you.

Rigby: Well...uh...we're here about a wallet.

Mordecai: Our friend Sureshot said he was partying here last night, thinks he left it behind.

Mantis King: Sureshot...Yes! Our lost and found box could contain any item lost or found!

(Two mantises arrives with a box that says, 'Lost and Found.')

Mordecai: Oh, cool! That's just like what we have at the park!

Rigby: I guess we're more alike than we think.

(The Mantis King laughs.)

Mantis King: Yes! I suppose we are.

(The two mantises with the box bought it to the heroes and opened it up, revealing Sureshot's wallet as one of the many things inside it.)

Rigby: There it is!

Mordecai: Sureshot was right. This was easy.

(He proceeds to grab it, but the box closes.)

Mordecai: Um...

Mantis King: But before outsiders can access our lost and found, it is our custom for them to join us at the royal feast!

Rigby: Oh! We wouldn't want to go against your 'customs.'

Mordecai: Yeah. We can have a little bite.

Mantis King: Let the feast begin!

(The heroes later all gathered in the dining room ready to eat with the mantises. A waiter removes the cover off Rigby's plate, revealing a bunch of bugs.)

Rigby: What?

(Goop containing flies is then poured into his cup.)

Rigby: No! You guys! This food!

Mordecai: We can't eat this!

Toothpick Sally: You drink down whatever they feed us until we get that wallet! That's an order! Our host is watching!

Benson: (almost falls) Woah!

HFG: Careful there, Benson. You don't want to break your other foot too.

Benson: (monotone) No, Fives, I certainly don't.

Muscle Man: Don't worry bro. Once we re-pave this basketball court, there won't be a crack in sight.

Benson: Thanks a lot guys. Since you're all working so hard out here, I wanted to treat you to sandwiches from Sandwicci's.

Muscle Man: Perfect!

Muscle Man: I'll get the number 12.

HFG: Yeah! For me too.

Skips: I'll get the 33.

Benson: Mordecai? Rigby?

Rigby: So we can get any sandwich?

Benson: Of course.

Mordecai: Whatever we want?

Benson: This menu is your playground.

Rigby: We'll have the 46.

Benson: Okay, two number 46's.

Mordecai: Just one. We can share.

Benson: Oh. Okay. One number 46.

Benson: Lunch is served!

Muscle Man: Oh. Awesome.

HFG: I'm starving.

Mordecai: Hey, I don't see our sandwich.

Rigby: Yeah where's number 46?

Benson: Let me get it.

Benson: This sandwich cost me $85.00!

Rigby: But you said we could order any sandwich we wanted.

Benson: I did...I said that. Now listen to me as I say this. If you two don't eat this entire sandwich by the end of the day, YOU'RE FIRED!!!

Mordecai: Pssh. We got this.

Rigby: Yeah, we've been eating to extreme's since before we can talk.

Mordecai: Or, at least since we were twelve. Remember that time with the cereal?

Villian (in the TV): sobbing

Rigby: Here it comes!

RGB2 (in the TV): I hope you've saved room for desert!

Mordecai and Rigby: OOOOOOOOH! Start Laughing

Mordecai: So good.

Rigby: Yeah.

Commercial Announcer: Don't go to sleep yet kids! (Mordecai and Rigby gasp) There's a new sugary cereal on the shelf to finish your day off right! With all the vitamins of a complete breakfast, RGB2io's are the best midnight snack.

Rigby: We need these!

Commercial Announcer: And if you buy now, 1 in 5 boxes have RGB2 toys, saying his catchphrase.

RGB2: I hope you saved room for desert!

Mordecai: We need that.

Mordecai: I just hear cereal.

Rigby: I think this one might just be a touch....not or exactly the same.

Mordecai: The commercial said 1 in 5's a winner, if we get 5 boxes there's gotta be a prize in one of them.

Mordecai: Nothing!

Sherm: (from upstairs) Rigby! You boys better not be awake down there!

Rigby: Were not!

(Rigby hides the cereal boxes under a blanket. Sherm walks in the room)

Sherm: Rigby what is this?

Rigby: What? Nothing.

Sherm: Nothing!? This is nothing? You've been digging for boxes again haven't you!? You know the rules son, don't you dare open a new box of cereal, until you finish this one. (To Mordecai) And since you're a guest in our home Mordecai, that rule goes for you too.

Both: Done!

(Rigby opens a new box.)

Rigby: This is it, this is gonna be it!

(Rigby dumps out the cereal and sees no toy.)

Rigby: Man!

(Rigby throws the box to the trash but misses. They turn and look at Sherm.)

Sherm: Don't look at me, look at your cereal.

(Mordecai and Rigby put the cereal in their bowls and sigh and take a bite. After they finish, Rigby opens another box. There isn't a toy, and they eat the next box)

Mordecai and Rigby: Done. (Rigby opens another box with no toy inside. Mordecai and Rigby collapse on the table. Scene cuts to the hospital, where they are laying in beds. Someone puts a bowl of RGB2io's to Mordecai's nose. He smells it and wakes up, repulsed and gagging from it)

Mordecai: Ugh! (He pushes it away)

Agent 1: Works every time.

Rigby: (wakes up) Huh? What's going on? Why does my skin feel like sausage casing?

Agent 2: Oh that's just what happens when you overdose on RGB2io's. A Lot of people don't realize this, but our cereal is borderline poison.

Mordecai: I thought that commercial said 1 in 5 boxes has a toy.

Agent 1: Yes. You just picked the wrong 5 boxes. Now, sign this waiver so we don't get in trouble (Mordecai pulls out a pen. Rigby does as well, and Agent 2 brings him a waiver)

Agent 2: Oh, and you can just have one of these (Pulls out an RGB2 toy) They're basically garbage.

RGB2 Toy: I hoped you saved room for..des..sert (Dies) (Mordecai and Rigby gag, and the flashback ends, going back to them eating the sub)

Mordecai: Yeah, that was a win.

Rigby: Score 1 for us! (snickers) Dude, remember that time with the huge ice cream sundae? (They laugh)

Mordecai: Or how about that bathtub full of mayonnaise?

Rigby: The mega burrito filled with a full buffet?

Benson: Less giggling, more gobbling!

Mordecai: Whatever. Dude,  we're like halfway done!

Rigby: Nice! Hey, remember that time in college? I think that was around the same time you sat on a brownie in your white jeans.

(flashback)

Mordecai: Make way for the cram master!

Rigby: (snores) Ow! hey!

Mordecai: Dude, I'm gonna order a pizza!

Rigby: Aww yeah! Pizza! What's the occasion?

Mordecai: Tradition, dude! I've got an Art History exam tomorrow. The night before a big test, I always order a Peparelli's pizza.

Mordecai: Hey folks, I wanna tell you that were 20
minutes off from our destination, and it looks like smooth sailing. So just sit back and relax. You're in good hands.

Man: Sir Mordecai, I just need your approval on these new logo designs.

Mordecai: Uh-huh. I approve

Man: Thank you sir. Great work, sir.

Stewardess on intercom: On behalf of our crew and our pilot, we just like to thank our CEO Mordecai International Airlines, Mordecai, for making the skies that much safer and being so responsible and dedicated to his job. Let's give three cheers to Mordecai!

Passengers: Mordecai! Mordecai! Mordecai!

Benson: Mordecai! Mordecai! Hello?!

Mordecai: Huh? Wha-?

Benson: Can you tell me what I just assigned you to do?

Mordecai: Uhhh...

Benson: The gutters! Clean them! Pay attention next time. Anyway, that about wraps it up. (Phone rings) Hello? Yes Mr. Maellard, uh-huh, important package. Today? Be there from 10 to 12. Yes, a big responsibility, we'll get it done, sir. OK, change of plans. We're gonna need someone to assign Maellard's package at the mansion. They'll have to be there from 10 to 12. Any takers?

Mordecai: Important?

Rigby: Mansion? Oh! Oh!

Mordecai: We'll take it.

Benson: Any takers? Muscle Man? Hi Fives?

Hi Five Ghost: Sorry, but we got a brunch date with Starla and my infrequently-seen girlfriend, Celia. Her globetrotting lifestyle makes her difficult to get a hold of.

Mordecai: We'll go!

Rigby: Right here!

Benson: Uh, Skips?

Skips: No can do. Got an appointment at the DMV. But I still have to wait in line. What's that about?

Mordecai: Helloooo...

Rigby: We don't have to go to the DMV!

Benson: I guess I'll have to do it.

Pops: Oh you can't. We have a schedule appointment to pick up my grandfather clock from the repair store.

Mordecai: Hey Benson, we'll do it!

Rigby: We'll do it Benson!

Benson: Ugh, fine. You're all a disappointment.

Muscle Man: Sorry, we didn't do anything.

Skips: But I gotta be in line at the DMV.

Benson: Mordecai and Rigby can pick up the package, here's the key for the door. And here's the security code for the front gate. But you better be serious about this job. It's a big responsibility, you have to stay focused.

Mordecai: (To Rigby) What did he just say?

Rigby: (Rapping) He said to stay F-O-C-U-S-E-D! focused make you better believe!

Mordecai: (Rapping) Our brains are working overtime to get what we need!

Rigby: We got psychic powers with telekinesis! You know we will beat this!

Mordecai: When the robot revolution comes you know we would...

Benson: You can't even stay focused for your own song! Just pick up the package!

(Scene cuts to the cart driving to the gate of the mansion)

Rigby: (Reading code) 5, 0, 0, 2

(Mordecai types in code. The steel gate's iron bars go into the ground and the gate opens)

Mordecai & Rigby: Woahhhh...

(They drive through the front lawn through trees planted to form a $ sign. Inside the mansion there's a horse)

Mordecai: I almost forget how huge this place is.

(They see a chocolate fountain with fruit on the table)

Mordecai & Rigby: Woahhhh...

(They see a hologram of a juggler)

Mordecai & Rigby: Woahhhh...

(They see a door knob collection hanging on the wall)

Mordecai & Rigby: Eh...

(They see a tiger in a cage roaring at them)

Mordecai & Rigby: Woah!

Mordecai: This place is insane.

Rigby: Look at this futuristic piano! (Kicks piano, it starts playing)

Mordecai: Hey Rigby, (Dancing with suit of armour) Check out my medieval moves, sir Rigby.

Rigby: (Dressing as pilot) I think you mean "Captain Rigby". It's gonna have to wait, I'm gonna sail this mini yacht. (Floating on mini yacht) You ready Captain Mordecai?

Mordecai: "Captain Mordecai"? (Shakes head) We should wait outside so we don't miss the package. We're being responsible.

Rigby: Ugh, fine.

(They sit outside on the porch)

Mordecai: Yup, don't wanna mess this up.

Both: Don't wanna mess this up...(Lying down)

Rigby: Something smells amazing.

Mordecai: Yeah, I think it's coming from the gate.

(They walk to the gate. Outside is a food truck)

Announcer on megaphone: It's the Buddy Bohn-mi truck business!

Mordecai & Rigby: What's Buddy Bohn-mi?

Announcer on megaphone: It's a really delicious Vietnamese sandwich. Come on down!

Mordecai: (To Rigby) Aw man, that sounds good, but the delivery truck's gonna be here any minute.

Rigby: Dude, there's nobody in line. We'll make it in and out two minutes tops. I mean it is right across the street, trust me.

Mordecai: Hm (Looks at street) Ok let's go.

(They cross the street to the food truck)

Mordecai: Two Bohn meats please.

Man: Ah, customers, finally. Comin' right up.

Cook (Behind him stands another guy whose arms reach in front of the cook smearing the bun): Ah, I think you're really gonna like this sandwich. Betcha haven't seen a sandwich made like this huh? The Buddy Bohn-mi system. Two people for one sandwich. Ah, (Slices cheese) Chop-chop!

Rigby: (Whispering) Why do they make the sandwich like that?

Mordecai: I dunno. Let's never comeback here ever again.

(Behind them the delivery truck arrives at the gate and drives inside)

Mordecai: Dude, it's the truck, we're gonna miss it!

Rigby: Augh! I hate you, Buddy system!

Man: it's the Buddy Bohn-mi system!

(M&R run to the gate but it closes)

Mordecai: Gimme the code!

Rigby: I can't find it!

Mordecai: Seriously?! Argh! (Presses random buttons but it's incorrect)

(More spikes appear on the gate. They look at the delivery guy ringing the doorbell)

Mordecai: Here, I'll boost you! (Gives Rigby a leg-up and throws him on the other side of the gate. Mordecai jumps over the fence) Ok, let's-

(Truck drives away)

Rigby: No no stop!

(They follow but the gate closes. The truck drives away down the street. Cut to Benson angry on the phone)

Benson: YOU MISSED IT?! ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS SIT THERE! You do that all day anyhow so WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT WHEN I TELL YOU TO?!

Mordecai: We're sorry Benson, we-

Benson: Just reschedule the delivery and fix this, or YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!! (Hangs up loudly)

Rigby: I'd say that was only a 5 out of 10 on the chewed out scale. Not bad.

(Inside office)

Mordecai: Let's look up the number of the delivery company. (Clears away papers on desk) Ugh! (Looks at computer) Ok, reschedule. Here we go. (Calls company)

Office worker: Customer service.

Mordecai: Hello? I need to reschedule the delivery for 6932 Richmonty way. We only just missed the truck, so could you turn around real quick?

Office worker: If you were so close, how did you miss it?

Mordecai: We were waiting in line for a Bon-me.

Office worker: What's that?

Mordecai: It's like a Vietnamese sandwich! Urgh! Can you turn down that old music?

Office worker: This is my personal music. It will arrive today between 2 and 4 o'clock.If you miss this one, it's going back to the sender. I suggest you do not wait for any sandwiches at that time, sir.

Mordecai: (Annoyed) Thanks. Bye.

Rigby: So this is our last chance to get the package? oh, if we miss this one it'll be a 10 out of 10 chew out.

Mordecai: Worse than that, we'll get fired. So we gotta be serious and wait at the door for the package.

Rigby: Yeah. Serious. When's the delivery window? 2 hours from now?

Mordecai: Yeah?

Rigby: So we'll be serious in 2 hours. Let's go check out more of the house!

Mordecai: What? No! We gotta be responsible.

Rigby: Come on, we got all that time to get the irresponsibility out of our system. Then when 2 o'clock hits, boom! we'll be all serious. Whadya say?

Mordecai: (Skeptic) OK, but as soon as it's 2 o'clock...

Rigby: All business.

(A montage follows showing M & R riding the horse through the mansion, scuba diving (along with the horse) in the giant fish tank, visiting the personal grocery store and buying golden food with sparkles. They eat the golden food and get sparkles on their tongues. As time passes, Rigby plays with the tiger with a fishing pole like a kitten.

(Episode begins at Pops' house.)

Rigby: Ugh! Why do we gotta watch the Wedding Network?

(Mordecai, Rigby, Fives and Muscle Man are in the living room, sitting in fornt of the TV.)

Rigby (continued): The jet-ski channel is just two channels away!

Muscle Man: Shut your face, bro. I'm trying to get ideas for Starla and I's wedding. So far, I thought of 10-foot onion ring towers, special seats that spin donuts, and a blimp that floats above the reception and rains barbecue sauce on command.

(The announcer is heard on TV.)

Announcer: Do you have an unrealistically ambitious wedding?

Muscle Man: No.

Announcer: Then become a contestant on "Married on Broke!" (shows different couples doing crazy activities on the gameshow) A twisted new gameshow from the makers of "Fool Me Once, Shame on You. Fool Me Twice, I Punch Your Face!"

Rigby: Oh, I've seen this one at Eileen's. People do the craziest stuff for a stupid wedding. I give it, like two and a half.

Mordecai: Out of what?

Rigby: I don't know.

Kyle Garrity: Congratulations! We're paying for the wedding of your dreams!

(The crowd cheers, then a husband sets on fire and Kyle grabs a fire extinguisher and extinguishes the fire off of him)

Muscle Man: I don't need some demeaning game to pay for my wedding, I have all the money I could ever want.

Rigby: What? How?

Muscle Man: Smart investments. Yeah, I've been using my paychecks to invest a little bumper stock called the Ant Farm Industry. (He opens the closet to reveal ant farms in it)

Mordecai, Rigby and Hi Five Ghost: Ant farms?

Muscle Man: So I'm pretty much basically rich. (His phones rings and he answers it) Talk to me.

Maurice: Muscle Man, it's your stockbroker. I'm calling to tell you that, uh... Yeah, ant farms are not real, not a real thing to invest in, a very bad investment, and, uh, I am not an accredited stockbroker.

Muscle Man: What are you saying, Maurice?

Maurice: (as he is being arrested by two cops in a desert) Oh, boy. You got no money, you just got a bunch of ants. Oh, ho, ho. Good luck fo the rest of your life!

(Maurice's call ended and Muscle Man closes his phone)

Rigby: What was that all about?

(His phone rings again in a different ringtone and Muscle Man answers it)

Muscle Man: Babe?

Starla: (as she's in a flower store) Babe, the flowers for our wedding, they're so expensive! You won't believe how expensive they are!

Muscle Man: Oh, come on, like, how many ant farms are we talking here?

Starla: (via-phone) Mitch, they don't take ant farms.

(Muscle Man is shocked at this, then the scene circle-wipes to a studio called "YZB - Studios" where Muscle Man and Starla are in the Casting Director's office, talking about how they want to be on the gameshow.)

Muscle Man (holding flashcards) Ahem. So, that's why we wanna be on your... (flips one flashcard) ...show. Thank you.

Casting Director: "Married and Broke" isn't a crass, violent show like "Fool Me Twice", it's a sweet, romantic show about love.

(One employee named Neil came bursting through the door)

Neil: A contestant's hair is on fire!

Casting Director: Augh! For the last time, Neil, the infirmary's next door!

Neil: Thank you, ma'am. (He leaves)

Casting Director: Anyway, our audience want to see couples they can love, and I fear you may not be likable or relatable enough for our viewers.

Starla: It's okay, Mitch. Our wedding will still be fine without flowers or anything else a wedding usually has.

(Muscle Man starts to get mad.)

Muscle Man: No one tells my girl where she can and can't be on TV! She's a goddess! (breaks a table with his fist) You couldn't even handle her!

(The Casting Director grabs her picture frame and removes her picture of her family and moves her picture frame on Muscle Man and Starla as Muscle Man starts wrecking the office.)

Starla: Mitch, calm down!

Casting Director: Hmm. Now this I like. You guys are in.

Muscle Man: (stops) Wait, what?

Casting Director: I said, you're in!

(Muscle Man and Starla are excited and Muscle Man twirls his shirt in the air and Starla jumps happily)

Muscle Man: WHOOOOO!!! Let's go win ourselves a wedding! (They kiss)

Casting Director: I'm gonna get the biggest bonus.

(Cut back to the house where Mordecai, Rigby and Hi Five Ghost are ready to watch Muscle Man and Starla's appearance on "Married and Broke")

Mordecai: Dude, it's starting. Turn it up, turn it up!

Skips: (enters the living room) Try not to get crumbs on the floor, I've noticed an ant problem lately.

Hi Five Ghost: Muscle Man's on a gameshow so he can afford his lavish wedding.

Skips: Make room for me on the couch.

Kyle Garrity: Hello, everybody, and welcome to "Married and Broke!" It's me, your host, Mr. Kyle Garrity. Let's meet our couples. (He goes to the Puppy Couple who are holding two puppies each) Hello there, what's your story?

Puppy Fiancé: Well, we sell puppies.

Puppy Fiancée:But you know, with the economy, we couldn't sell enough puppies to afford our wedding.

Kyle Garrity: Can we get a closeup on that, Hank? (the camera closes up to one puppy who is yawning) Oooh, that is one young dog.

(The audience cheers)

Kyle Garrity: (goes to the Orphan Couple) How about you two?

Orphan Fiancée: (grabs the microphone from Kyle) Well, thanks for asking, Kyle. We learned about five years ago that they are orphans, so, like, we're a foundation to end orphan-ism. (the audience cheers again) But we're a non-profit, so we need to, like, pay the orphans to put together our wedding.

Kyle Garrity: That's so honorable. (goes to Teddy and Tina) Our next contestants, Teddy and Tina!

Teddy: Thank you, thank you. We lost our wedding fund tragically while fighting in the army for our great country. We were carrying money on our backs, but a grenade blew it up while we saved an entire platoon from a rebel attack. But we'd do it again.

(They ripped off their clothes to reveal their American jumpsuits)

Teddy and Tina: For America!

(The audience cheers again)

Kyle Garrity: (goes to Muscle Man and Starla) And you two... you... What's... what's all this about?

Muscle Man: Well, I'm, like, a guy, and she's, like, a chick, and we want 10-foot onion rings at our wedding so that's what we wanna pay for.

(One member from the audience, who looks unhappy at their appearance, leaves)

Kyle Garrity: Well, aren't you good for stating the idea of the show! Now, for the rules. You will compete in a set of really crazy, physical challenges. The last couple standing wins the free wedding! May the worst couple fail.

(The game starts as the names various obstacles appear onscreen. The first challenge is the "Tower and Shower Challenge" where the couple contestants have to climb up a giant tower made out of many wine glasses. Teddy and Tina use aerobics to get to the top and they pull the rope that pours water and they couple contestants stand still except for the Orphan Couple who were knocked off by the water, causing them to lose. Teddy and Tina win the first challenge. The next challenge is "Can Ring Run" where the boys have to carry the girls while wearing rings while running on presents while avoid the cans. Muscle Man and Starla are knocked by the cans and Teddy and Tina win the second challenge. Starla grabs Muscle Man and they continue to run through the second challenge. We zoom out of the TV at the house where the guys, including Benson and Pops, cheer on Muscle Man and Starla when they noticed ants coming at them. Cut back to the game show where the next challenge is "Love Dove" where they have to train the doves, which Teddy and Tina did when they expand their arms and four doves each land on their arms)

Muscle Man: Oh, come on...! (A dove flies into his mouth)

(The next challenge is the "Leap of Faith" where they have to jump and use their bottle rockets and not to get eaten by crocodiles wearing bridal hats. Teddy and Tina jump and pull their bottle rockets, which pops out confetti and they land on the target)

Teddy and Tina: (hi-five) Yeah!

(The Puppy Fiancé accidentally pulls one string of his rocket bottle, causing the Puppy Couple to land on a side of the gameshow and lose. Muscle Man and Starla fall and grab their strings of their bottle rocket)

Muscle Man: Oh, no bro!

(They pulled their strings of their bottle rockets and they land safely on the floor)

Muscle Man: We made it at the last second.

(We zoom out of the TV at the house again where the ants attack the guys while screaming. Cut back to the gameshow, where they face the next challenge, "High Rice" where Muscle Man and Starla and running towards two guys who are throwing rice at them. Teddy and Tina try to get pass them, but they slip on the rice and they fall, much to Muscle Man and Starla's delight, but Ted whistles and a flock of doves from the "Love Dove" challenge grab Teddy and Tina to safety, much to Muscle Man and Starla's annoyance. The challenges end)

Kyle Garrity: And we're left with two remaining teams. Teddy and Tina, how are you two holding up?

Tina: Well, Kyle, after that rebel attack, we're just happy to be here. It's like a dream.

Teddy and Tina: Ah, an American dream.

(The audience cheers)

Kyle Garrity: And, in an very unlikely turn, these guys. Them. Well, onto the final round: cross the threshold! (The curtain falls down to reveal a obstacle course similar to the Baka Blitz from "Fool Me Twice") The first team to carry their fiancé across every threshold and ring the wed-ding dong wins!

Muscle Man: Uh, doesn't this obstacle course look kinda like the one from...

Kyle Garrity: What, are we made of money?! Are your marks. (The two couples team start their positions) Get set.

Starla: Mitch?

Muscle Man: We got this, babe.

Kyle Garrity: Go!

(The two teams start. Teddy carries Tina through a door, then Muscle Man carries Starla and he tries to do the same, but they can't fit)

Starla: Mitch!

Muscle Man: Suck it in.

(They finally fit through the door and they continue on. Teddy and Tina jump through one door a wheel of doors, then Muscle Man and Starla do the same, but they crashed it.)

Muscle Man: Come on, babe. (He continues on)

Starla: Mitch!

(They jump on the trampoline through a door, and they continue on. Muscle Man does the same, but he goes through the door)

Muscle Man: Starla, come on! We gotta...

Starla: (from a distance) Mitch!

Muscle Man: Huh? (sees Starla on the trampoline, looking sad. He goes to her) Starla, what's wrong?

Starla: Look at them, Mitch.

(They see Teddy and Tina go through a double-decker doorway as they continue on)

Muscle Man: What are you seeing here, babe?

Starla: There's a perfect couple, Mitch. They've got something special and everyone loves it. And where does that leaves us? We're just second-rate. People like us don't get cheered on, they see our love and it makes them wanna toss it.

Muscle Man: Listen, Starla, I may have made some bad investments in my life, but this relationship isn't one of them. I don't care if people like us, 'cause I love you, and we got something they don't have: passion.

(They kiss each other)

Audience Member 1: Hold on! Do these two have actual wants and desires? I relate to that!

Audience Member 2: Even though they're really hard to look at, they're doing it for love.

Audience Members: Yeah, alright!

(They continue to kiss as they form an electric giant red crystal. Teddy and Tina see this.)

Teddy: I've never seen anything like that.

(They continue on, destroying every threshold in the obstacle course as Teddy and Tina continue on as they get closer to the red button)

Tina: Toss me, Teddy!

(Teddy tosses her to the red button as she and the crystal are getting closer to it, then a white explosion appears as the dust clears and the audience sees Muscle Man and Tina's hands on the red button)

Kyle Garrity: Wow! Whooo! Could we get an instant replay on that, Hank?

(The camera plays the footage in slow motion and reveals that Tina uses her big polished American fingernail to press the red button, meaning Teddy and Tina won the gameshow and the audience cheers on them.)

Teddy: Thank you! Thanks, everyone!

Tina: Oh, thank you so much!

Teddy and Tina: USA, eh? USA, eh? USA, eh?

Muscle Man: Huh? Hold up! "USA" only has three letters in it. Say it again, bro.

Teddy: Ahem. Uh, USA, eh?

(The audience gasp in shock)

Kyle Garrity: "Eh"?!

Teddy: Alright, look, look, we... Oh, we sure are sorry. We can't help it, we're Canadians.

(They reveal their shirts with the Canadian symbol on it under their American jumpsuits and the audience gasp in shock again)

Kyle Garrity: How dare you!

Audience Member 3: So, that's why they were so nice and perfect!

Teddy: (goes to the microphone) Oh, we sure feel like a couple of hosers. We're just simple maple farmers. I ride my moose to work just like anyone else and I put on my hockey mask on one strap at a time. We thought having a big fancy American wedding for free was more important than telling the truth, and we're sorry.

Kyle Garrity: (cries for a bit and wipes his tear with his tissue) Get... get them out of my sight! They're disqualified!

(The board changes Teddy and Tina's score from "winner" to "disqualified" and a cop arrests Teddy and Tina and they leave, then Kyle goes to Muscle Man and Starla)

Kyle Garrity: I'm sorry I forgot your names before, but television glorifies beautiful people. I've actually struggled with my looks for years. That's why I grew this mustache, otherwise I'd look like a newborn baby. Muscle Man and Starla are the winners!

(The audience cheer on them as the board scores Muscle Man and Starla as winners, and they're so glad they won)

Starla: I'm sorry I called us second-rate, Mitch.

Muscle Man: It's alright, babe. We'll still have a first-rate wedding.

Starla: Could we have a blimp that rains barbecue sauce?

Muscle Man: (gasps at his idea from earlier and blushes) Babe.

(They hug as they audience cheers, then we cut back to the house, now destroyed with a giant ant hill behind it. Mordecai, Rigby, Fives, Benson and Skips made it out alive from the Alien Ants' invasion)

Mordecai: Is everyone okay? I think we got 'em all.

(A UFO with two Alien Ants in it appears above them)

Alien Ant: Curse you, Mordecai and Rigby! We'll get you!

(A missile that destroys the UFO and killing the Alien Ants is fired by Pops, who holds a bazooka)

Rigby: Thanks, Pops.

Pops: Oh, my pleasure.

Mordecai: So, do you think Muscle Man and Starla won that gameshow?

(Episode ends)

(Episode opens with Pops' room as his alarm clock rings and he gets up. Cut to Pops taking a shower, then to him walking out of the house, whistling, as a huge cardboard of a castle with a banner that says "Kingdome of Parklandia - Est. 1452" gets put up, covering the front of the house. Pops stops walking and sees medieval props and people set for a Renaissance fair)

Pops: Aah! What in the dickens?! (He gets scared, backs up and sees the castle carboard-covered house) Where did the house go?! I've gone back in time. (A guy on stilts walks in front of him)

Guy on Stilts: Watch where thou doth walketh! (continues walking)

Pops: Oh, my! (bumps into a dwarf)

Dwarf: You like tomatoes? How about these tomatoes?! (starts throwing tomatoes at him) How about another?! And another?! (laughs)

(Pops starts running only to run into three gypsies attempting to charm him only for him to continue running away)

Pops: BAD SHOW!!!!

(Cut to the Park staff sitting on the stairs with Benson carrying a box of costumes)

Benson: Alright, now, I know things have been crazy with the dome and everything, but thanks for getting up early and setting up for the Renaissance fair. This is gonna be a big money-maker for us. One last thing: As of this moment, your modern selves are no more. (Starts throwing the costumes to the guys) Mordecai and Rigby, you'll be Mordicus and Rignatius, lowly street vendors. Skips, you'll be Barnaby the Ripped, guard to the king. Fives and Muscle Man, you'll be Palom and Porom, gatekeepers.

Muscle Man: I'm not wearing this, bro. This cut isn't flattering to my butt.

Benson: And, of course, I will play King Edmund of Parklandia. (puts on a crown and robe and takes out a wizard costume) Where's my wizard? Where's Marvolo?

Skips: If you mean Pops, nobody's seen him all morning.

Benson: What?! (groans and holds up a scroll-like poster) He's the star of our big closing ceremony, Marvolo vs. the Dragon!

Rigby: We have a dragon?

Benson: Yes! (points behind a huge box containing a mehcanical dragon inside it) Without a big closure, the commoners will demand refunds! Find Marvolo and don't breaketh thy character or I'll smite thee with unemployment!

(The guys groan as they start putting on their costumes except Muscle Man and Fives)

Skips: Eh, the things I do for a paycheck.

Muscle Man: I'm still not gonna wear this.

Rigby: I hope the power doesn't go to his head.

(Cut to a different area of the Renaissance fair with a poster on a tree that says "Bow to King Edmund, The Lord & Protector", then it pans over to Pops sitting on a rock with a sword on it, looking worried.)

Pops: (trying to talk to a fairgoer walking by) Uh, excuse me, help? I'm trying to get to my own time.

Wench: (approaching Pops with another wench) What's the matter, love, you lost? (they laugh as they walk away)

Minotaur: (approaching Pops while holding a corn dog) Freak! (walks away)

Pops: Oh, another fine mess I've gotten myself into. How will I ever get home? (sees Mordicus and Rignatius at a nacho vendor cart)

Rignatius: (offscreen) Augh! This costume is making my butt itch.

Mordicus: Rignatius, stay in character or we're gonna get fired.

Rignatius: Oh, sorry. Mine butteth itcheth. No, wait. My bottometh? Me cheeks?

Mordicus: Yeah, that worketh.

Rignatius: Me cheeks itcheth!

(A knight awkwardly walks away with a tray of nachos as Pops approaches them)

Pops: Mordecai and Rigby, I thought I'd never see you again!

Rignatius: Oh, dude, Pops! (Mordicus elbows him) Uh, I mean, Marvolo!

Pops: Marvolo? No, It's me, Pops.

Mordicus: No, no, you are Marvolo, huh? (winking his eye) The wizard, yeah?

Pops: What's wrong with your eye?

Rignatius: Listen, Marvolo, you have a very important job to do: you have to defeat the dragon, or everyone will demandeth a refund.

Pops: Dragon?! I won't fight a dragon, Mordecai and Rigby!

Mordicus: Marvolo, do you wanna be sacked? Call us Mordicus and Rignatius.

Rignatius: Yeah, the Mordecai and Rigby you know haven't have born yet. (winking his eye)

(Pops gasps as Mordicus punches Rignatius' arm)

Mordicus: Cometh with us, and we shall explain everything. You don't wanna make King Edmund mad, do you?

Pops: Mad king?! (screams and runs away)

Mordicus: The king's not gonna like this.

(Cut to the King's box seat inside medieval-themed colosseum)

King Edmund: RAAAAAGH!! What doth thoust mean you lost him?! (eats grapes fed by Starla, dressed as a tavern wench, as she walks away)

Mordicus: He got frighten and fled. He seems really confused, my liege.

King Edmund: Impossible. This doth be unacceptable!

Rignatius: Hey, man, don't yell at us! Pops is the one flipping out!

Woman: (gasps) Flipping out? Mine ears ache from period-inappropriate prose.

Kid: Mayhaps a refund is in order, Auntie.

King Edmund: (gasps) Pay no heed! The king wishes good tidings on thee all! (throws a bunch of coins on the woman and kid)

Woman and Kid: Huzzah! Huzzah!

King Edmund: Now, go forth and and encourage others to spend coin of their own! (turns red and turns to Mordicus and Rignatius) What did I say about breaking thine character?!

Mordicus and Rignatius: (bowing down to the king) Forgiveness, forgiveness!

King Edmund: No matter. It appears I must fetch Marvolo mineself.

(Cut to Muscle Man and Fives in pillory stocks with a squire, the dwarf and the gypsies standing)

Muscle Man: Augh! This is bogus, like, super lame-o deluxe!

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, totally whack, guys!

Squire: By order of Mad King Edmund, these two shall be punished for the crime of not staying in character!

Dwarf: You maketh me sick! (throws tomatoes at Muscle Man as they walk away)

Muscle Man: Fine, I'll wear the costume.

Pops: Oh, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, you are stuck in this dreadful place, as well?

Muscle Man: Our names are Palom and Porom, sir.

Hi Five Ghost: The mad king's reign of terror must end, Marvolo.

Pops: I'm not Marvolo! Why does everybody keep calling me that? I just wanna go home.

Muscle Man: Only you can end this. End this, Marvolo.

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, end this.

Squire: (spots Pops) Hey! Seize Marvolo by the order of Mad King Edmund! He's, like, really, really upset about this. Seize him!

(Two knights who are drinking with a viking and a centaur start chasing Pops who runs away)

Muscle Man: Go, bro!

Squire: Quiet, oaf! (throws a tomato at Muscle Man)

(Pops continues running away as he runs into a blacksmith who is hammering a sword, then into an executor's eagle that screeches at him, then he sees a poster for "Marvolo vs. the Dragon", starring himself as Marvolo)

Pops: NOOOOOOOO!!!

(King Edmund and two knight, who are riding on horses approaches Pops)

King Edmund: Marvolo the Wizard. A powerful dragon hath decsended upon us, and only ye can stop it.

Pops: Oh. You must be the mad king.

King Edmund: Look, Marvolo, if you don't slay the dragon right now, the commoners will demand refunds, and my Kingdome shall crumble!

Pops: For the last time, stop calling me Marvolo! (starts running again only to bump into the poster and fells the ground, knocked out as the screen goes black. He wakes up in a room and sees Barnaby dressing him up in his wizard costume.) Skips, am I back home?

Barnaby: I know not of this Skips, I am Barnaby the Ripped. King Edmund hath sent me to prepare ye for battle against the dragon, Marvolo.

Pops: What? (screen pans to a mirror where Pops is in his Marvolo costume.) Oh, no.

Barnaby: Take this. (gives him a wand) For the closing ceremony, all you have to do is point it at the dragon and press ye button to defeat it. You can end all of this, and we can go home. The Kingdome of Parklandia awaits thee. (leaves the room)

Pops: Everybody's telling me I'm Marvolo. (goes to the mirror) Maybe, I am Marvolo. Who am I?

Marvolo: You are Marvolo.

Pops: No, it can't be.

Marvolo: It is so. I am you, and you are me.

Pops: Then it doth be true. Oh!

Marvolo: Yes! You are ready. It is time to face your destiny. End this.

Pops: I... am Marvolo!

(Cut to the colosseum where trumpet players play a fanfare)

Squire: Presenting King Edmund of Parklandia!

King Edmund: My loyal subjects, thank ye for joining me on this glorious day! I trust your experiences in my Kingdome hath been most pleasurable. May we rejoice in hopes that nothing bad should ever happen. (silence) I said, "May we rejoice in hopes that nothing bad should ever happen"!

Palom: Yeah, yeah, I heard you. 

(He opens a gate and the dragon comes out, just standing as the crowd is barely impressed)

King Edmund: (turns to Mordicus, who is holding a controller) Fire, the fire!

(Mordicus presses the "fire" button and the dragon breathes fire, making the crowd really impressed)

King Edmund: Oh, no! This is truly the greatest calamity in the history of Parklandia! There is only one wizard who put an end to reign of terror! Presenting Marvolo the Wizard!

(Marvolo comes out and faces the dragon. He tries to charge, but falls down as the crowd boos at him.)

Knight 1: Man, this is lame.

Knight 2: We should've gone over to the Ren fair over at East Pines instead.

Knights: (chanting) Ye olde refund! Ye olde refund!

Crowd: (joining in the chant) Ye olde refund! Ye olde refund! Ye olde refund!

King Edmund: Fight, Marvolo, fight to the death!

(Marvolo gets up and charges at the dragon, but it swats the wand right under the King's box seat)

Rignatius: Here, give me that! (He grabs the controller as he and Mordicus are struggling for it)

Mordiucs: Leteth go, man!

(They toss the controller as it lands on Rignatius' tray of nachos on the ground, making it short out, causing the dragon to malfunction, move on its own and go crazy as the crowd cheers, then it breathes fire as the crowd runs away)

King Edmund: (jumps into Barnaby's arms) Servant, save ye king!

(Pops watches the mechanical dragon breathe fire on the colosseum)

Barnaby: Marvolo, get thine wand and press the button!

(Pops sees a ladder goes to a hammer, breaks the glass and uses the ladder to grab the wand as the dragon faces Pops)

Pops: Alright, you big brute, this ends now! (He presses the button, which the wand flies out and lands in a puff of smoke, which annoys the dragon) I did it. Good show! (the dragon knocks Pops off the ladder)

Mordicus and Rignatius: POPS!!

(Pops hangs onto the dragon's snout as it flings him off, sending him flying to a tower where the knights are as is starts to fall)

Knight: Best Ren fair ever!

(A chain of towers fall as everyone runs away, and the last tower falls collapses right on the dragon. Marvolo emerges from the rubble and walks up to the now-destroyed dragon.)

Marvolo: I did it, I defeated the dragon! Now, I get to go home!

(The dragon's lower jaw breaks and falls on Pops, knocking him out as the screen cuts to black. Pops wakes up in his bed in his room as Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, Fives, Benson and Skips are standing there, watching him)

Rigby: He's waking up.

Pops: King Edmund? Barnaby? Rignatius and Mordicus?

Benson: No, Pops, it's us. Everything is back to normal. The Park broke even and all is well.

Pops: But I was in medieval times. It was so real. (points at Benson) You were a mad king. (points at Rigby, Skips and Mordecai) And you were there, and you, and you, and I was... (gasps dramatically as he sees Marvolo in his mirror)

Marvolo: Shhhhhhhhh. (leaves and drives away in an off-screen vehicle)

(End of Marvolo the Wizard)

(Episode begins with Mordecai and CJ on the cart listening to Tag Team's "Whoomp! (There It Is)" while Mordecai is driving.)

Mordecai and CJ: Whoomp, there it is! Whoomp, there it is! Whoomp, there it is!

Mordecai: Break down.

(Mordecai and CJ start break dancing and laughing.)

CJ: Fun fact about me -- I did a color-guard routine for this in the ninth grade.

Mordecai: Uh, fun fact about me -- this song was on a mix tape I made in the seven grade titled "Maxin' and Relaxin'". I was the master at mix tapes. I'd pick a title, then put together a perfect mix. Like "Good Vibes and High Fives", "TV Watchin', Pizza Noshin'", "Mad Schoolin', Straight Foolin'".

CJ: Wow. You were pretty cool, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Yeah, I was. (He grins)

(Mordecai stops the cart in front of CJ's apartment building.)

Mordecai: I'd play them for you, but the tapes are all at my mom and dad's.

CJ: Dude, we should listen to them!

Mordecai: Sure, I could get them tomorrow maybe.

CJ: I'd love to come along.

Mordecai: You... wanna...

CJ: Come along to your parents' house! We can get the tapes, I could meet your parents... (She gasps) I can meet your mom!

Mordecai: M... My mom?

(CJ nods her head.)

Mordecai: (Loudly and nervously) Ha-ha! I mean, why not? We've been going out for a few months now, right? Why wouldn't you want to meet my mom? I mean, it's not like I can keep my mom from you forever!

(Mordecai laughs nervously, then start hyperventilating.)

CJ: Great! (She kisses Mordecai on his cheek, then punches his shoulder.) Thanks for the dinner/movie.

(CJ gets out of the cart and runs toward her apartment while waving goodbye to Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Yeah. Can't wait for you to meet my mom!

(Circle-wipe to Pops' House. On the couch, Rigby plays a video game while Mordecai sits next to him.)

Mordecai: She can't meet my mom, dude.

Rigby: What's the big deal? Your mom's totally cool.

Mordecai: She's totally psycho.

Rigby: Whaaat?

Mordecai: She'd always go out of her way to embarrass me whenever I had a girl over.

Rigby: Yeah, but how many times did you have a girl over? Zero? (He stops plays the game) Was it zero times?

Mordecai: No! Remember Daphne Gonzales?

(In a flashback, teenage Mordecai plays a mix tape called "Studyin' & Buddyin' Vol 2", then sits on his bed next to Daphne Gonzales.)

Daphne: Music?

Mordecai: Uh, yea-ah.

Daphne: (She covers one of her ears) It's loud.

Mordecai: (He covers one of his ears and talks over the loud music) Uh, so what did you get for question 12?

(Mordecai's mom kicks the door open and enters with a plate of snacks.)

Hilary: Hey, kids! Sorry I had to kick the door open. I-It was closed for some reason. (Laughing) This music! What's going on, a dance party?

(Mordecai's mom starts dancing and moves toward the bed. Mordecai covers his face in embarrassment.)

Hilary: Come on, Mordy! Shake what your mama gave ya! Your butt, Mordy! I'm talking about your butt!

Mordecai: What do you want, Mom?!

Hilary: I made some snacky-wackies for my wittle study buddies. Pigs in a blanket and, uh, prunes. (Whispering to Daphne) The prunes are for Mordy, hon. Keeps him regular.

Mordecai: Mom!

Hilary: What? It does.

Mordecai: Ugh! Okay, Mom, fine! Just leave now, alright?! Gosh!

Hilary: (She sets the plate down on a table) Okay, okay, Mordy. I'll leave. It's just... (She turns to face Daphne with teary eyes) Daphne, thank you.

Daphne: Uh, for what?

(As Mordecai's mom speaks, Mordecai shakes his head for her to stop talking.)

Hilary: For being the first girl Mordecai's ever brought over! (She picks up a video camera) It's going on the tape! So tell me -- how do you like studying with my son? Tell me for the tape.

Daphne: I gotta go!

(Daphne picks up her school bag and bolts out of the room. Mordecai collapses onto his bed in a fetal position, his face completely red.)

Mordecai: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

(The flashback ends.)

Rigby: So that's why Daphne wrote "I hope you're still eating your prunes, ha-ha!" in your yearbook.

Mordecai: Molly Sherman, Bernice Chan, Sasha Diaz -- none of them lasted a day with my mom.

Rigby: (He goes back to playing a game) Sounds rough, man.

(Circle-wipe to Mordecai's dad William's home office. As he drinks coffee, his phone rings. He answers.)

William: Well, if it isn't my favorite and only son.

Mordecai: Uh, hey, Dad. I'm thinking about coming by the house with my girlfriend so I can grab one of my old mix tapes.

William: Girlfriend, eh? I'm sure your mom will love that.

Mordecai: That's kind of the problem. She gets weird when I bring girls home. It's embarrassing.

William: Wait. You've brought girls home? How many times?

(Mordecai makes a stoic, unamused face.)

William: Was it zero times? Anyway, I know Mom can go overboard sometimes, but I'm not sure what you want me to do about that.

Mordecai: Just... Is there a time I can come by when Mom won't be home?

William: Well, she does have Punchercise tomorrow night, but--

Mordecai: Look, I know it's messed up, but please don't tell her we're coming.

William: Uhp, uhp! I can't lie to that woman. Haven't in 25 years. Except if she asks if she could still pass as a college student. Then you lie. Otherwise, no lies!

Mordecai: Just don't tell her!

(Title card: THE NEXT DAY. Mordecai and CJ enter his parents' house.

Mordecai: Dad, we're here!

William: Ah, there's my boy!

(Mordecai and William share a hug.)

Mordecai: Ha. Hi, Dad.

William: And you must be CJ. I'm William.

CJ: Nice to meet you, sir.

William: Please, call me Will. "Sir" is my boss's name. Unfortunately, Mordecai's mom isn't around at the moment.

Mordecai: (Faking disappointment) Mom's not here?! Darn it! Life's so unfair! Oh, well. Next time or whatever. Anyway, I'm just gonna run up and grab that tape so we can--

(The front door suddenly bursts open.)

Mordecai: Aah!

(Mordecai's mom enters wearing exercise clothes and carrying dumbbells.)

Mordecai's mom: Where's my little champion?

Mordecai: Mom!

(Mordecai's mom runs up and hugs him.)

Mordecai: (Strained) You're home!

Mordecai's mom: Of course I am. You don't think I'd miss my handsome gent coming home, do you? And when your dad told me you were bringing a new sweetie over, I decided to take the afternoon Punchercise class so I could run right home to see you two.

(Mordecai glares at William, who then shrugs.)

William: 25 years, no lies.

Mordecai's mom: (Looks at CJ) And you! Wow! Gorgeous!

CJ: Yup. I'm smart and funny too.

Mordecai's mom: And modest. She's the whole package. (She puts an arm around Mordecai) Mordy, tell me you and this bombshell will be staying for dinner.

Mordecai: Uh, actually, we were--

Mordecai's mom: Pshaw! I insist! Besides, I already whipped up something special before Punchercise. You two sit tight. It'll be ready in a jiff.

(As Mordecai's mom passes by him, she playfully kicks him in the butt.)

Mordecai: (Bitterly) Can't wait.

(Mordecai and CJ go upstairs.)

Mordecai: Sorry my mom's so weird.

CJ: She's totally sweet.

(They enter Mordecai's old bedroom.)

Mordecai: Here's my room.

CJ: Whoa. Yup. Yup. You can tell a lot about a man from the room he grew up in.

Mordecai: Anyway, I think my mix tapes are in the closet.

(Mordecai opens his closet door and fishes around for the mix tapes, but he doesn't find them.)

Mordecai: Hmm, they aren't here.

Mordecai's mom: (Calling out from downstairs) Mordecai! Mordecai, I need you right now!

Mordecai: Ugh! I'll see what she wants.

(In the kitchen, Mordecai's mom is cutting carrots.)

Mordecai's mom: Mordecai!

Mordecai: (Comes down the stairs behind her) What? What is it, Mom?

Mordecai's mom: Is CJ a vegetarian?

Mordecai: That's what you called me down for? No, Mom. No, she isn't.

Mordecai's mom: Oh, good! She can have some of my prized meatloaf.

Mordecai: Can you just be normal?

Mordecai's mom: Normal?

Mordecai: Yeah, normal! Ever heard of it? Let's not go nuts here, okay?

Mordecai's mom: Don't worry. Let me show you the dessert.

(Mordecai's mom shows him a cream pie topped with berries; the berries spell out CJ's name. Mordecai gasps in mortification.)

Mordecai's mom: See, the berries spell out--

(Mordecai quickly eats the dessert with his hands.)

Mordecai's mom: Hey! Stop! What are you doing?!

Mordecai: (With his mouth full) Sorry. It just looked so good, you know? I couldn't wait. You've still got it, Mom.

Mordecai's mom: You're lucky I have... a backup!

(Mordecai's mom shows him a gelatin in CJ's likeness; it has grapes for hair, pineapple slices for eyes, and a dot of whipped cream for a nose.)

Mordecai's mom: Think she'll like it?

(Mordecai's mouth hangs open in shock.)

Mordecai's mom: It was hard to get all her features. Gelatin is such an unforgiving medium. But luckily, I got a bunch of her photos off the internet.

(Mordecai races up the stairs and into his room.)

Mordecai: CJ! CJ! We got-- We gotta go!

CJ: What? Why?

Mordecai: We just gotta! Before--

Mordecai's mom: (Calling out from downstairs) Dinner's ready, kids!

Mordecai: (He sighs) Never mind.

(Title card: 2½ HOURS LATER. Mordecai, his parents, and CJ are at the dinner table.)

William: He kept running and running.

Mordecai's mom: And he shoots the ball into the other team's basket!

(Mordecai's parents and CJ laugh while Mordecai hides his face and pounds on the table.)

Mordecai: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Mordecai's mom: (Laughing) Oh, memories. I've been collecting them, you know, CJ.

CJ: Yeah. (She playfully elbows Mordecai) I'm collecting a few interesting ones myself.

Mordecai's mom: No, I mean on tape. It's called (Echoing) "Mordy Moments".

(The screen zooms in on Mordecai's mortified face. In a flashback, Mordecai sits next to his dad, his uncle Steve, and his aunt Maxine while his mom holds a video cassette labeled "Mordy Moments".)

Mordecai's mom: Okay, who's ready for some "Mordy Moments"?

(Mordecai's mom puts the cassette in the VCR and joins her family on the couch.)

Mordecai's mom (on tape): (Imitating fanfare) Bum-da-da-bum! Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-buuuum! "20th Century Mom" Presents Mordy Moments!

(In the first scene, kid Mordecai gets tangled up in a Slip 'N Slide.)

"Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai: Yea-ah! Ohhhh! Ahhhh!

(Mordecai's parents, uncle, and aunt laugh while he watches in utter shock. In the next scene, young Mordecai is Peter Pan in a school play.)

"Peter Pan" Mordecai: Just think a happy thought, and you can fly too!

(When he jumps, his harness malfunctions, giving him a bad wedgie and fell. Uncle Steve is so amused, he does a soda spit-take. In the next scene, infant Mordecai is covered in spaghetti and meatballs.)

Baby Mordecai: "Pasghetti" everywhere!

Mordecai's mom (on tape): "Pasghetti" on your tushie!

(In the next scene, teenage Mordecai is playing saxophone in a marching band. When his pants fall down, he trips, falls on his face, and his mouthpiece gets stuck in his beak. As his parents and relatives laugh, Mordecai blushes. As he slides onto the floor, the flashback takes a disturbing turn, with Mordecai's parents and  relatives towering over him in deep, distorted laughter. Mordecai slams his fists on the floor in humiliation

Mordecai's mom: You remember that tape, Mordy?

(Mordecai's parents and CJ look at him.)

Mordecai: Oh. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Mordecai's mom: You know, you two should stay for a bit longer. We could eat the special dessert I made for CJ, then we could watch the tape!

William: Now where did I put it?

Mordecai's mom: I think you put it in the basement.

Mordecai: (Quickly gets out of his chair) I'll intercept-- I mean, look for it. (He runs out of the kitchen.)

Mordecai's mom: CJ, you're in for a real treat.

(Mordecai goes into the basement and finds a cardboard box labeled "Mordy's Stuff".)

Mordecai: Yes!

(Inside the box, Mordecai finds both his "Maxin' and Relaxin'" mix tape and the "Mordy Moments" video cassette.)

Mordecai: Jackpot.

(Upstairs, Mordecai hears the others talking.)

CJ: So why do you guys have so many prunes again?

Mordecai's mom: Once Mordy brings up the tape, I'll show you why.

Mordecai: Sorry, Mom.

(Mordecai tries breaking the tape with his forehead, but he only hurts himself.)

Mordecai: Aaaahhh!

(Mordecai then tries breaking the tape by throwing it against the floor, but it bounces across the room and into a VCR. As it begins playing, spirits fly out of the TV screen. Mordecai runs away, but the spirits shove him back onto the floor.)

Mordecai: Where's the mix tape?

"Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai: Oh, you mean... this mix tape?

(A ghost of young Mordecai tangled in the Slip 'N Slide holds up "Maxin' and Relaxin'".)

Mordecai: Hey, give it back!

(Mordecai tries to take the tape back, but "Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai throws it over to a ghost of teenage Marching Band Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Aah! What the heck?!

(Marching Band Mordecai then throws the tape over to a ghost of "Peter Pan" Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Who are you?!

("Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai, Marching Band Mordecai, and "Peter Pan" Mordecai stand side by side.)

Mordecai: Whoa... You're all me!

"Peter Pan" Mordecai: Brilliant. Grab him!

("Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai and Marching Band Mordecai shove the real Mordecai into a chair.)

Mordecai: Ugh! Get off!

(Mordecai is tied to the chair by a watering hose.)

Mordecai: Aah! Aah! Help! CJ! Mom!

"Peter Pan" Mordecai: Pfft! Yeah, right. Why would Mom want to help you after tonight?

Mordecai: What does that mean?

(Marching Band Mordecai plays a low note on his saxophone.)

"Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai: Yeah. It means that while you were busy looking for your dumb little mix tape, we put together a little mix tape of our own.

(The TV screen plays back several "Mordy Moments" from earlier in the evening.)

Mordecai's mom (on tape): Stop!

Mordecai (on tape): Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Mordecai (on tape): Can you just be normal?

Mordecai's mom (on tape): Normal?

(The TV turns off.)

Mordecai: Alright, fine. I admit I haven't been super nice to Mom tonight. But of all people, can't you guys understand? She humiliated us! She put our most embarrassing moments on tape, and now you're stuck like this forever!

"Peter Pan" Mordecai: You have to learn to let go, dude. Embarrassing moments make us who we are. The problem isn't that we're stuck like this on "Mordy Moments". (Points to Mordecai's head) It's that we're stuck like this in here.

"Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai: Besides, Mom can be really cool. Remember after I got caught in the diving slide?

Mordecai: Oh, yeah... To make me feel better, she took me out for the biggest sundae I ever saw. I guess that was really cool of her.

(The Slip 'N Slide stuck around "Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai unravels.)

"Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai: I'm free!

Mordecai: Yeah. She had to pull a lot of strings to find a good doctor to remove that saxophone.

(As Marching Band Mordecai plays a note on his saxophone, the saxophone vanishes.)

Marching Band Mordecai: Yea-ah!

"Peter Pan" Mordecai: And after the play, she hunted around for weeks to find me a new pair of rocket-ship underwear.

Mordecai: Aw, man. You guys are right. Mom's totally rad, and I've been a complete jerk to her all night just because I wanted CJ to think I was cool.

("Peter Pan" Mordecai's harness disappears, dropping him to the floor.)

"Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai: Dude, CJ does think you're cool. (He frees Mordecai from his watering hose binds) But girls don't dig guys who are jerks to their mom.

Mordecai: You're right, guys. Thanks. I needed that.

"Peter Pan" Mordecai: Glad to help, bro.

"Peter Pan" Mordecai, Marching Band Mordecai, and "Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai, : See ya! Wouldn't want to be ya!

(The three ghosts of Mordecai's past vanish.)

Mordecai: Heh. I guess that stuff is pretty funny.

("Maxin' and Relaxin'" and "Mordy Moments" appear in front of Mordecai. He leaves the basement, and his mom walks up with the CJ gelatin in her hands.)

Mordecai's mom: Mordecai? Did you find "Mordy Moments"?

(Mordecai shows his mom the "Mordy Moments" cassette.)

Mordecai's mom: Oh, good. Come on. Everybody's in the living room. Uh, Mordy, we don't have to watch it if you don't want to. Is it embarrassing for you? Do I embarrass you?

Mordecai: Mom, you don't embarrass me. I've been acting totally crazy. Sorry about being a jerk tonight.

(Mordecai and his mom share a hug.)

Mordecai's mom: Aww. My little boy could never be a jerk.

(Mordecai and his mom join CJ and William in the living room.)

William: Well, look who it is. You found it?

Mordecai: Yup.

Mordecai's mom: And here's dessert! (She sets the gelatin down on the table)

CJ: Wow! It's like looking in a jelly mirror.

Mordecai's mom: Oh-ho-ho-ho! This one's a keeper, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Okay, okay, everybody, settle down. Welcome to the 10th annual screening of "Mordy Moments". I need everybody to turn off their cellphones, and no food or drink in the theater -- except Mom's dessert.

(Mordecai's parents and CJ laugh.)

Mordecai: And I'm gonna need everybody to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

(Mordecai's parents and CJ continue laughing. Mordecai joins in the laughter and plays the tape before sitting down next to CJ.)

Mordecai's mom (on tape): (Imitating fanfare) Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-buuuum!

(CJ leans on Mordecai.)

CJ: This is way cooler than a mix tape.

Mordecai's mom (on tape): ..."Mordy Moments"!

(Behind the couch, the three ghosts of Mordecai's past look on before disappearing.)

"Slip 'N Slide" Mordecai: Yea-ah! Ohhhh! Ahhhh!

Baby Mordecai: "Pasghetti" everywhere!

(Mordecai, his parents, and CJ laugh as the episode ends.)

(Episode begins with Benson, Pops, and Skips in the kitchen of the house.)

Benson: Everyone ready for the barbecue? How's everything coming, Pops?

Pops: I've been making pies all morning! (He laughs and brings out the pies.)

Benson: Skips?

Skips: I made Chilli.

Benson: Well I have a little surprise. I was getting excited for the annual barbecue so in addition for putting on this shirt (he is wearing a red shirt that had white flowers on it) I splurged on some Super Extra Premium Grade A Hot Dogs.

Pops: Oh, it's been a while since I had a grilled meat link.

Skips: So where'd you get them?

Benson: I got them online. I spared no expense, I even paid extra for overnight shipping.

Skips: So where are they? Let's throw those babies on the grill.

Benson: I gave them to Rigby.

Skips: Huh?

Pops: Oh, are Mordecai and Rigby grilling already?

Benson: No, no, I just told them to bring them outside. I definitely told them NOT to grill the hot dogs.

(At the picnic area, Mordecai and Rigby are standing around, with Rigby holding the hot dogs.)

Mordecai: You sure Benson said we could grill the hot dogs?

Rigby: Benson totally said we could grill the hot dogs.

Mordecai: Sweet! (He takes the hot dogs from Rigby.)

Rigby: Let's get grillin'.

Mordecai: Chillin' and Grillin'!

Mordecai & Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

Mordecai: Whoa, Benson spared no expense. Real ingredients? Dude, these are like luxury hot dogs. (He puts them on the grill) Dude, this thing won't light.

Rigby: I know how to get that baby going. (He grabs lighter fluid from the table) Outta my way.

(He puts the lighter fluid on the hot dogs, and starts the grill, continuing to put it on the hot dogs.)

Mordecai: Okay, dude, I think that's good.

Rigby: What?

(The grill explodes, then the hotdogs catch fire)

Rigby: I got it!

(He takes the tablecloth and puts it on the fire, yet it makes it worse, causing Mordecai to roar. Mordecai and Rigby take the grill as fast as they can and Mordecai drops the grill over the bridge and into the river. The burned hot dogs float away.)

Rigby: Aw, man. I guess that's why Benson told me NOT to grill.

Mordecai: What?!

(Mordecai drags the grill back to the picnic area, with the grill dripping wet.)

Rigby: I said I was sorry. Come on, man.

Mordecai: No! No more "Come on, man"s. Benson's gonna totally blame me and it's all your fault! I'm sick of you always gettin' me into trouble!

Rigby: I just wanted to grill time with my bro. Chillin' and Grillin'.

(Mordecai puts his arms up.)

Rigby: No. No, don't.

Mordecai: It's too late. (He begins to move his arms together.)

Rigby: Come on, dude. Don't!

Mordecai: It's already in motion.

Rigby: Well, put it out of motion!

(Mordecai has finally crossed his arms) 

Mordecai: You pissed me off. (In reruns, the line is changed to "You ticked me off.")

Rigby: Augh! Dude, no. Look at me. (He punches Mordecai, but no effect) Look at me! (He punches him again multiple times with the same results) Augh! If I fix it, will you stop being mad at me?

Mordecai: Maybe.

Rigby: Fine, I'll fix it. I'll just go get some more hot dogs from the meat locker down in the basement. Benson will never know, okaaaaaaaaay?

Mordecai: Fine. You'd better fix it, though.

(Mordecai and Rigby go down to the meat locker as Rigby opens the doors.)

Mordecai: Augh, I hate goin' down in the meat locker.

(They both go to meat locker and Mordecai holds the door. Rigby is looking for the hot dogs.)

Rigby: Don't worry, it'll be super quick, man. I'll get the hot dogs, you hold the door.

Mordecai: Fine.

Rigby: Meat, meat, meat, meat.

Mordecai: Hurry up, dude. It's freezing.

Rigby: I can't find 'em.

Mordecai: Argh! I knew you couldn't fix it!

Rigby: Wait! I think they're on top, but I can't reach.

Mordecai: I'll grab 'em. Come hold the door.

(Rigby goes to hold the door while Mordecai looks for the hotdogs.)

Mordecai: I don't see 'em.

(Rigby approaches Mordecai.)

Rigby: Did you check over there?

Mordecai: Yeah, I already... DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! THE DOOR!

Rigby: Oh, my gosh! I totally propped it open with some bags of ice! Check it.

(The ice bags fall and the door slams shut. Mordecai gets mad and is about to cross his arms.)

Rigby: Wait, wait! I can fix it, there's a safety latch!

(Rigby goes to it and begins pulling it.)

Mordecai: Dude, don't force it!

(The latch breaks and Mordecai and Rigby are banging on the door for help.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Benson! Skips! Help! Pops! HELP!!!!!

(Skips, Benson and Pops hang out in the kitchen. Benson and Pops encourage Skips to drink as much Soda as he can.)

Benson & Pops: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yeeeeeeeeaaaaahwoooooooo! (Pops cackles)

(Back to the meat locker.)

Mordecai: Arghhhh!!! You did it to me again, man!

Rigby: Dont worry. Ill get us out of this.

(Rigby tries to break the meat locker door window with a big veal leg 10 times.)

Mordecai: Just give it up, dude. I knew you couldnt fix it.

Rigby: Dude, I fix stuff all the time.

Mordecai: No, you dont.

Rigby: What do you mean?

Mordecai: The cart, the shoes, the party. That other party.

Rigby: Stop right there! You know Muscle Man pushed me.

Mordecai: Muscle Man wasnt even there!

Rigby: Fine, Ill fix it.

Mordecai: You mean, like when you fixed the grill? Or when you fixed the hot dogs by burning them. Or... Oh, no, wait, I know. You mean, like you brought us down and locked us in the freezer to find more hot dogs? Oh, but surprise, surprise, there are no hot dogs.

Rigby: But I can...

Mordecai: No! Dont even say it! Just shut up so I can find a way out of here before we freeze to death.

(After walking away, he chills his breath)

Rigby: Mordecai! I found the thermostat! I can totally fix it!

Mordecai (with blocked nose): Oh, no. (He looks behinds and finds Rigby holding a frozen drumstick) WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' WITH THAT DRUMSTICK?!?!

(Rigby hits a duct with the drumstick, causing the temperature to drop severely. Rigby hops out of the way and Mordecai takes the freezing cold while groaning with anger.)

Rigby: Mordecai, Im sorry! Let me try and fix it!

Mordecai: ARGHHHHHHHHHH!!! Im sick of you saying that! You cant fix this, okay? All you do is mess things up and ruin peoples lives!

Rigby (distressfully): Sorry. I just wanted to help.

Mordecai: Stop pretending like you do anything but get me in trouble! You cant fix anything! And now... Im gonna d-d-die because of you.

(Mordecai puts his arms up.)

Rigby: No! (Mordecai crosses them) Dude, dont be mad at me! Mordecai, DONT DIE MAD AT ME!

(Mordecai turns away.)

Mordecai: Too.. late.

(Mordecai falls to the floor unconscious. Rigby kneels down and touches Mordecai's face.)

Rigby: Mordecai? Mordecai? (He stops touching Mordecai's face) Oh, no! Oh, no! I can fix this! I can fix this! (Walks away and puts Mordecai's legs on his shoulders and drags Mordecai away.) Dont worry, Mordecai. Im gonna take care of us. Youll see. (Montage goes to Rigby looking for the hot dogs in tall boxes. He doesn't find them and picks up Mordecai's ankles and walks off. Next scene goes to Rigby carrying Mordecai by his neck, and then we see Mordecai's body being pushed off by Rigby. Next scene shows Rigby looking tired and weak, and holding Mordecai by his chest.) How am I doing? Ah, Mordecai? Am I doin' all right? (He gently moves Mordecai's head like a puppet and pretends that Mordecai is speaking.) Yeah, Rigby, youre doin' good. (He drops Mordecai's body and stumbles on a box with hot dogs.) Hot dogs. Ive been looking all over for you.

Hot Dog: Please, frozen stranger, can you free us?

Rigby: Yeah, I can free you. But you're gonna have to do something for me. Heres what you gotta do...

(Mordecai is still unconscious, and he dreams about Margaret and him on a island. She is wearing a seashell bikini top and a grass skirt)

Dream Margaret: Hey, Mordecai.

(Mordecai has a muscular body.)

Dream Mordecai: Margaret. You look stunning.

Dream Margaret: Spin with me.

Dream Mordecai and Dream Margaret: Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Dream Margaret: Oh, Mordecai.

Dream Mordecai: Oh, Margaret.

(A giant Dream Rigby rises up from the sand.)

Dream Rigby: Mordecai! (In a deep, manly voice) IM GONNA FIX IT!

(Mordecai wakes up.)

Mordecai (groaning): Rigby?

(Mordecai sees the Hot dog leader shaking hands with Rigby.)

Rigby: Oh, hey, youre awake! (He goes to Mordecai and helps him sit up by putting his hands on his shoulders) Mordecai, Mordecai, I told you I can fix it! (The hotdogs are by Mordecai's legs) While you were dead, I found those talking hot dogs and they're gonna help us.

Mordecai (weakly): What?

Rigby: They said they know the way out!

Hot Dog Leader: Its true. We can guide you out of the meat locker. But only if you will agree to take us to a barbecue where we can be eaten.

Mordecai: What? You WANT to be eaten?

Hot Dog Leader: Yes. It is our destiny to be eaten.

Mordecai: Dude, this is weird. Bensons gonna know these are not the hot dogs he bought. Look at them!

Rigby: No. he wont know, just trust me. I promise, itll work out.

Hot Dog Leader: Do we have a deal?

(Rigby shakes the hot dog leaders hand.)

Hot dog Leader: Its a deal!

(All hot dogs cheer. A portable cooler appears from the floor. Its cover opens and Rigby peeps in there.)

Rigby: Dude, this is the way out!

(The same cooler appears at the barbecue place.)

Rigby: Dude, they're not here yet! We still have time!

(Rigby, Mordecai and hot dogs come out from the cooler.)

Benson: Man, I cant wait for those hot dogs!

Mordecai: Here they come. This'd better work.

Rigby: Itll work. Just relax.

Benson: Hey, hey!

Rigby: Hey, Benson, Ive got the hot dogs right here. I didnt grill em, just like you said.

Benson: Oh, boy, this is gonna be the best barbecue ever!

(The leader jumps up)

Hot dog Leader: NOW!

Mordecai: What the?

Benson: What the heck are those?!

(Hot dogs attack everyone.)

Rigby: This wasnt part of the deal!

(Hot dogs force Benson, Pops, Skips and Mordecai into somewhere.)

Rigby: Wait!

Hot Dog Leader: Ha-ha-ha! You fell for our trap. Brilliantly. We dont want to be eaten, we want to eat YOU.

Rigby: But what about the prophecy?

Hot Dog Leader: There is no prophecy. This is simply revenge. For all our fallen brother and sister hot dogs massacred by the hand of your barbecue. And now, youll join your friends awaiting a similar fate!

(Mordecai, Benson, Skips, and Pops are trapped in a giant plastic bag of steaming hot red oil.)

Benson: Help, Rigby!

Pops: Bad show.

Skips: Help!

Mordecai: Help!

Rigby: No! What are you doing to them?!

Hot Dog Leader: Marinating them, of course. Bag the last one!

(Rigby tries to escape by throwing barbecue stuff at the hot dogs.)

Rigby: Stand back, man! Stand back!

(Rigby runs out of stuff to protect himself with. But when he accidentally squirts mustard at one of the hot dogs, two other hot dogs surprisingly start to eat each him.)

Hot Dog #1: Awhhh! This stuffs delicious!

(Rigby realizes what to do. He squirts mustard at every hot dog. Hot dogs slay each other. Benson, Pops, Skips, and Mordecai manage to get out of the bag.)

Benson: What the heck was that? What did you do?

Mordecai: Yeah, Rigby. What did you do?

Rigby: Uh, well, I... Ahhhh.... (He gasps and notices an empty plastic package of Super Extra Premium Hot Dogs.) Dont look at me, Bensons the one who went and bought the crazy Super Premium psycho Hot Dogs!

Skips: Oh, yeah! Hes right.

Pops: I indeed remember now.

(Rigby winks at Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Yeah, hes right.

Rigby: Yeah, this wouldn't have happened if you'd just bought regular hot dogs!

Skips: Thats for sure.

Pops: That is true.

Benson: No, but... I dont know what happened.

Rigby: Well, I guess the barbecue is ruined now thanks to Benson.

Pops: No!

Skips: What?

Benson: No, no, no, no, I can fix it. (He gives Rigby $20 and whispers to him.) Quick. Go and buy some hot dogs from the store and make sure theyre regular. (to the others) Im sorry, guys. Minor setback.

Skips: I hope the overnight shipping was worth it.

Mordecai: Dude, that was awesome.

Rigby: I told you Id fix it.

Mordecai: I knew that you would.

(The episode begins with the Park Dome zooming through space, Pops is in a painful struggle after the events of the previous episode. He has flashbacks)

Pops: Bad show...

(The gang watch over him)

Eileen: He's so weak.

Rigby: What did Anti-Pops do to him?

Mordecai: It was the same thing he did to Earl! Like he almost erased him from existence or something!

Benson: Let's just do what Earl said, and get Pops to the Seer!

(The computer AI can be heard)

Computer: Now approaching Planet Nielsen.

(Everyone looks out towards Planet Nielsen)

Rigby: That's a planet?

Eileen: It looks like some weird appliance.

(They notice some floating technology being erased from existence)

Skips: I've got a bad feeling about this.

(The crew lands on Planet Nielsen. They run forwards, and are greeted by stream boxes)

Stream Box 1: Welcome to Planet Streaming. Would you like to upgrade for an ad-free experience? Only $3.99 a month!

Benson: Planet Streaming? I thought this was Planet Nielsen!

Stream Box 2: Planet Nielsen is obsolete. Everything is streaming now. We are currently showing 6.8 billion forms of online content. Would you like to start your free trial? We just need your credit card num-

(The Stream Box zooms in on the Park crew)

Stream Box 2: -ber...

(The Stream Box's screen starts flashing up with "Disc Masters")

Stream Box 2: It's them! Take them to holding!

(The Stream Boxes dash towards the Park crew)

Benson: Ugh! Does everything have to try to kill us?

(Lasers are suddenly shot down towards the Stream Boxes. It's revealed that these are coming from Reel-to-Reel and a new ally, Black & White. They land)

Mordecai: Reel-to-Reel?

Reel-to-Reel: Discmasters, it truly is a small universe to see you here. This is Black & White, sworn brother of the Format Wars.

Black & White: We need to get you out of here.

Benson: But we need to get Pops to the Seer!

Reel-to-Reel: The Seer? (laughs) No-one sees the all-knowing Seer, but the Seer always see you.

Mordecai: So, can you take us to her, or...?

Reel-to-Reel: Yeah. We can take you.

(He sees Pops)

Reel-to-Reel: But first, he needs medical attention. Follow us.

(They all run to the medical centre)

Black & White: Hurry! Before Streaming sends reinforcements! Brace yourselves!

(Black & White presses a button which turns the floor into an elevator. They land underground, and run to Microwave's door. Reel-to-Reel knocks on it. Microwave pulls a blinder, waiting for the password)  

Reel-to-Reel: Be kind, rewind.

(Microwave opens the door)

Microwave: Reel-to-Reel! What's the -

(He pings as he notices Pops)

Microwave: Frozen burritos! Get that guy in here, stat! 

(They lay Pops on a table, as Microwave opens the door on his body, revealing some food. He feeds it to Pops)

Microwave: Come on, now, come on! Chew it!

(He helps Pops chew)

Microwave: Yes, chew it up. Come on! There you go! He's stable. After 50cc's of Salisbury Steak and a little rest, he'll be good as new!

Rigby: You're a doctor?

Microwave: I was a doctor, in the resistance.

(He reveals a Pops tattoo on the palm of his hand)

Microwave: Before the Format Wars. Before Streaming took over!

Mordecai: Took over?

Reel-to-Reel: I've got it all right here.

(He reveals a reel-to-reel tape, and projects it onto a screen. There is a shot of Planet Nielsen)

Narrator: Planet Nielsen! A place where all universes can be seen under one roof. Here, we have highly trained analysts, watching and tracking views of the various universes throughout the galaxy.

(A Nielsen worker is seen working)

Nielsen Worker: "Hangin' with the Plartians", 13 million viewers, ages 12-35!

Narrator: Business was booming for Planet Nielsen! Advertisers would pay top dollar to know how many people were watching each universe, until Streaming came along and took over!

(Streaming is seen killing a worker and an advertiser on the screen, and laughs) 

Narrator: Streaming didn't care what people were watching, because it already knew! Thus rendering the Nielsen system obsolete! Hopeless and jobless, Streaming banished the workers to the bowels of the city forever, where they tried to preserve the ways of the old formats. Because - what happens if you want to watch your favorite universe when the internet is down? Or if you want to see the glorious quality of a DVD, instead of the poorly compressed video of streaming? The world may never know.

(The tape ends)

Reel-to-Reel: Now that you know the history, you understand why the old formats must put an end to this torrenting tyrant!

Rigby: Why couldn't Streaming be stopped by this all-knowing Seer?

Black & White: She just relays information about what she sees. Whether or not she has actual powers is kind of a gray area.

Reel-to-Reel: Everything's a gray area to you, Black & White.

Muscle Man: Ouch. Reel-to-Reel getting a little too real.

Black & White: Indeed. Shots fired.

(The whole room shakes and Microwave enters the room)

Microwave: They know the chosen one is here!

Reel-to-Reel: We've got to get to the Seer now!

Eileen: What about Pops?

Pops: I'm alright!

(Pops sits up)

Pops: Take me to the Seer.

(Everyone runs out of Microwave's office)

Microwave: Go! Run! I'll hold them off! I hope they're hungry...

(Microwave puts a pizza pocket in his body door)

Microwave: Always follow proper heating instructions.

(He runs towards the Stream Boxes)

Microwave: For the Formats!

(He explodes, along with the Stream Boxes. The explosion catches up to the Park crew, who fall to the ground)

Black & White: Come on! This way!

(They run into the original Nielsen office. They can hear the workers talking to themselves. Mordecai and Rigby look into an office cubicle, where the same worker from the tape is seen)

Rigby: (gasps) They've got free coffee!

(Mordecai and Rigby run to the coffee machine)

Mordecai & Rigby: Work perks!

(Rigby goes to take the coffee but is stopped by HD DVD and Blu-ray, who are hidden under a hood)

HD DVD: Stop! Nielsen employees only, what are you doing down here?

Reel-to-Reel: It's okay, HD. They're with us.

(HD DVD and Blu-ray gasp)

HD DVD: The chosen one.

Blu-ray: And it's the five Discmasters as well!

(They take off their hoods to reveal themselves)

Benson: DVD? You're here too?

HD DVD: No. DVD is dead.

Benson: What?

HD DVD: Yeah. I'm HD DVD now! I got upgraded. New voice chip and everything. High definition, baby! Now I'm the most superior physical format to date. Take that, dad!

Blu-ray: Forgive my brother. His picture quality isn't as clear as mine, so he forgets things. I'm Blu-ray and I'm obviously the most superior physical format to date.

HD DVD: Whatever, I still have better sound definition than you!

Blu-ray: Tell that to my ten gigs of extra storage.

HD DVD: I would, but I think someone's surface coding is a little too thick to understand!

Blu-ray: Well at least I'm not the one with the ability to roam any region, and still went crying home to daddy!

HD DVD: You leave father out of this!

Reel-to-Reel: Whoa, whoa, kids! Don't scratch a disc! We need to get Pops to the Seer.

HD DVD: Right, sorry. Follow us.

(They arrive outside the Seer's location. They are blocked off by a wall)

Blu-ray: Allow me, my bitrate is faster.

HD DVD: Your face is a bitrate.

(Blu-ray plugs a USB stick into a slot on the wall, opening the door to the Seer's home. Blu-ray enters, and is followed by Pops and the gang. The Seer can be seen with her back turned, watching multiple universes on her many screens)

Reel-to-Reel: Seer! We have brought the chosen one.

Seer: Ah yes, Pops. I've been expecting you.

(She turns her chair around to face Pops)

Pops: You know who I am?

Seer: Of course I do. I know each and every one of you.

Muscle Man: You don't know me!

Seer: Oh, Muscle Man. Always so brash. You know who else is always so brash?

Muscle Man: Uhh, who?

Seer: Come on...you know.

Muscle Man: I don't know what you're talking about, lady!

Seer: My...mom...

Muscle Man: Whoa, bro.

Seer: That's right! I've been watching you guys since the very beginning. I know everything about you. 

Mordecai: Everything?

Seer: Sure. You all work at the Park, you and Rigby are the slacker duo, Benson's the grouchy manager, Skips is immortal. Funny stuff!

Rigby: Psht! Anyone could have known that!

Seer: Oh yeah?

(The Seer clicks a button on her remote. The main opening sound plays as we hear Mordecai and Rigby onscreen shouting "OOHHH!" On the screens, clips from the episodes "The Power", "Caffeinated Concert Tickets" and "Mordecai and the Rigbys" are seen)

Seer: You started off really strong. 

(Clips from "Steak Me Amadeus" and "Merry Christmas Mordecai" are seen)

Seer: But when Mordecai started dating Margaret, things levelled off a little.

(Clips from "Yes Dude Yes" and "Play Date" are seen)

Seer: I was always more of a CJ fan myself.

(Clips from "In the House", "Creepy Doll", and "Jacked Up Jack-o-Lantern" are seen)

Seer: Every Halloween was a spiking interest, but lately that's been a little weak as well.

(Clips from "Rigby's Graduation Day Special", "The End of Muscle Man", "Dumped at the Altar", "Welcome to Space", and this episode are seen)

Seer: Rigby going to high school helped! As did Muscle Man getting married. Everybody sure loves weddings. And the whole going to space thing? Whoo! I was not expecting that. I'm curious to see where things go now. But then again -

(The Seer switches off her screens)

Seer: Everything must end eventually.

Benson: End? What will end?

Seer: Your universe, of course! Many universes have come and gone, it's the natural order of things. Yours lasted longer than most, but now the universe, your lives, the Park...everything. It's going to end.

(Everyone gasps)

Pops: It can't end!

Seer: Ah, but this is what this has all been leading up to, Pops. 

(The Seer presses her remote again, and a silhouetted image of Anti-Pops surrounded by flames is seen)

Seer: The final battle with your evil twin.

(Pops gasps, followed by the room shaking. HD DVD and Blu-ray run in)

HD DVD: We can't hold Streaming much longer!

Blu-ray: We gotta get Pops out of here!

(The gang run through a tunnel, Stream Boxes are seen moving towards the gang as they fire lasers at HD DVD and Blu-ray, who then jump in the air to begin their transformations)

HD DVD: Not today, you dumb data boxes!

(HD DVD puts a disc in his chest, as "HD" is seen on the screen)

Blu-ray: You cash hungry content coffins!

(Blu-ray puts a disc in her chest. The two jump into the air and fire laser beams at the Stream Boxes. Eileen notices that the Seer is calm)

Eileen: How are you so calm? The universe is ending!

Seer: It's not my universe that's ending, it's yours. It's a shame that I won't be able to watch it anymore. I've really grown quite fond of you all. Personally, I wish you had a bigger role, dear.

HD DVD: Ugh, it's like an oversaturation of the marketplace.

Blu-ray: Time to cancel our subscription!

(HD DVD and Blu-ray fire a disc laser at an army of stream boxes, who explode. The guys approach the Park Dome)

Benson: We're almost there!

(Suddenly, Streaming, an upgraded version of Internet, is formed)

Streaming: Hahahahaha!

Blu-ray: Streaming?!

Streaming: Hello HD DVD and Blu-ray! And you've brought all your remaining formats to me. Finally, I can add you all to my queue OF DESTRUCTION!

(Streaming fires a ray at HD DVD and Blu-ray, but Reel-to-Reel quickly jumps in the way)

Reel-to-Reel: NO!

(Reel-to-Reel gets blown up, causing his reel-disc to fall to the ground)

Black & White: Reel-to-Reel! He was the original! Agh!

(Black & White runs towards Streaming)

Blu-ray: Black & White, no! You can't stop him!

(Black & White fires lasers at Streaming)

Streaming: Fool, there's no escape. Streaming is the future!

(Black & White gets blasted by another ray, as Streaming gets hit by a Laser, causing an error and Streaming to buffer. HD DVD and Blu-ray run to Black & White)

Blu-ray: You can make it, Black & White. There's still a market for you!

Black & White: In space - *coughs* - No-one can hear you...stream.

(Black & White's screen switches off, indicating his death)

HD DVD: Quick, while he's still buffering!

(The gang run past Streaming and into the Park Dome)

Blu-ray: Go, go!

(Pops turns to look at HD DVD, Blu-ray, and the Seer)

Seer: Now you must go to where it all began, Pops. To your home planet, Lolliland, that's where the final battle will take place.

Pops: Do I really have to fight my brother?

Seer: You've fought him before, and you will fight him again, and your universe will reset itself. That's how it's always been and how it will always be.

Pops: There must be another way!

Seer: Hmm, sometimes doing something different makes all the difference! But then again, everybody loves re-runs!

(Streaming rises behind the final three)

Streaming: Oh, no!

Seer: Go now, Pops. Make it a jolly good show.

(Pops runs into the Dome as it flies off. HD DVD and Blu-ray fight off Streaming. Everybody is in the control room)

Benson: Eileen, enter the coordinates!

Eileen: You got it!

(Eileen searches for Lolliland, and a picture shows up, and it's the exact same planet that Pops felt a connection with in the episode "Pops' Favorite Planet")

Pops: My...favorite planet.

(Cut to black. End of "Meet the Seer")
(Episode begins with Huge Head hiding in the bushes the park.)

Huge Head: You stole my name, Pops, and it won't be over until I get my revenge! (Chuckling evilly) (The camera pans over to the guys sitting down while Benson is seen messing with some sweets.)

Rigby: Hey Benson, what's with the fancy spread?

Benson: Mr. Maellard said he needed to give an announcement this morning. (Turns toward the others.) You know, you all could learn a thing or two about boss appreciation...

(Suddenly, Mr. Maellard's limo crashes through the sweets and Mr. Maellard steps out of his limo.)

Benson: (Sighs and facepalms) Mr. Maellard! How nice of you to visit us today.

Mr. Maellard: No time for bollocking Benson. Take a seat. (Benson does so) As you all aware: Park attendance has been declining for years. With no visitors, I'm basically just paying you boys to babysit Pops at this point. 

Pops: And they're doing a bang up job.

Mr. Maellard: With that in mind, I've decided to shut down the park.

Mordecai: No visitors? Well, what about, uh, that guy?

Huge Head: Wait, not yet!

Mr. Maellard: One ugly guy, plotting revenge on my son for the last four years isn't enough to keep the park open. You guys all had a good run, but I'm afraid you're all fired. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go rig a yacht race.

Benson: Wait! Mr. Maellard! Mr. Maellard!

Mr. Maellard: Benson, get a hold of yourself.

Benson: Please, just give us one more shot. It's all I've got (groans)

Mr. Maellard: Uuuuugghh, oh geez. Look, it'll take a week for the paperwork to go through, but if you could get attendance up, I might reconsider. (Benson grins) But, I'm talking about real Park visitors, not a bunch of weirdos hiding out in the bushes.

Benson: Thank you Mr. Maellard! (Car window starts to close) Thank you so much!

Mr. Maellard: (annoyed) One week Benson. (Limo quickly drives away, causing Benson to lose his balance and falling on his back) 

Benson: (Weakly) ...Thank you Mr. Maellard.

(Circle-wipe transitions to the house with Huge Head still hiding in the bushes) 

Huge Head: Not yet! Ho, ho, ho!

(Cut to the guys in Benson's office with a turnstile) 

Benson: Maellard sent us this turnstile to keep tabs on our attendance. Ideas for bringing in more visitors? Anyone?

(No one response)

Mordecai: (mumbling to himself and putting his hand over his shoulder) Paddle boats?

Benson: Mordecai, do you have something you'd like to share?

Mordecai: Oh, uh, I was just thinking that paddle boats are kind of lame, so maybe, if we could...

Rigby: Woah! Let me stop you right there, 'cause I see where you're going and I like it!

Mordecai and Rigby: Battle boats!

Rigby: Like bumper cars, but on the high seas.

Mordecai: Slap small tires on the sides, get people lances for jousting.

Skips: I don't think that's a good idea.

Benson: Hold on, Skips. Now, obviously battle boats is a terrible idea. We all agree on that. But we've got just one week to save the Park. So no idea, besides battle boats, is too stupid. Now, come on, let's get some visitors to the Park!

(Montage begins with Monday where Pops flies Carmenita with a banner that says "Visit the Park!" in the sky, Mordecai and Rigby are arrow sign holders holding up the signs that says "Park", and Benson and Skips setting up an air dancer that says "Park", but the tabber says "000", meaning they have no visitors. On Tuesday, Mordecai and Rigby are at the Snack Bar with Mordecai crossing out the "No" in the "No Refills" sign to make it say "Refills". On Wednesday, a ball pit is set up, and as a kid and his mom are walking towards the ball pit, Pops appeared out of the balls, scaring the kid and his mom and they ran away, and the tabber says they have 2 visitors. On Thursday, Mordecai places a sign that says "Concert Tonight!" on a stage and the guys as Mordecai and the Rigbys are performing on stage, but no one is here. Circle-wipe transitions to the house with Huge Head still hiding in the bushes as the montage ends.)

Benson: (offscreen) Well, this was a disaster.

(Cut to the guys back in Benson's office with a gird chart with the arrows that represents visitors are going down, meaning they got negative visitors)

Benson: (continue) Low turnout is one thing, but how did we get negative visitors? Guys, in 24 hours, Maellard's gonna shut the Park down! No more ideas at all?

Hi-Five Ghost: We could update our resumes.

Skips: Good idea. (He opens and looks at his scroll-like resume that says "Ye Old Skips' Resume, Park Worker, 1800 - NOW) Oy.

Benson: This is it.

Pops: (his eyes filling with tears in sadness) I'll miss you all (blows his nose with a tissue)

Benson: Aw, come on, guys. (sniffles) Let's have some fun at our last night, huh? Wing Kingdom? My treat?

(Cut to the guys in a gazeebo at East Pines eating chicken wings from Wing Kingdom and drinking sodas while they're chattering)

Benson: So, I'm all like "You don't get it, man."

Rigby: Oh, yeah, I remember that.

(Skips burps)

Benson: (shushing) Hey, hey! I wanna say something. Here's to the best crew I've ever worked with!

(Everyone cheers)

Benson: And you know what? I'm just gonna say it. Maellard is a jerk!

(Everyone, except Pops, cheers again)

Pops: He's my father, though.

Benson: And people are jerks, too. Why wouldn't you wanna come to our Park? I mean, look how pretty it is tonight.

Mordecai: You know what my favorite part of the Park is? (points to the left) That tree right there. Wait, that's not... Or... where was it, again?

Pops: Come to think of it, where are we?

Skips: Ah. I've worked here for years. I've never seen this part of the Park before.

(Gene and his two employees are behind the gazeebo)

Gene: That's because this isn't your park!

Taylor: Yeah! Remember stuff somewhere else. You're holding up the line for the gazeebo. (points behind a line of angry people waiting for the gazeebo)

Benson: How did we end up in East Pines?

Mordecai: (slaps his face) How many wings have we had?

Muscle Man: Quick, guys, let's trash the place! (He slaps a glass of soda off the table, jumps above the lights and attempts to destroy the poles, but fails) That's actually pretty solid.

Gene: Get 'em outta here!

(Taylor and the other East Pines employee escort Benson out of East Pines)

Benson: Hey! Stop! Cut it out! (He attempts to unwrangle himself from the employees, but fails) Sweet threads. (Taylor and the other East Pines employee throws Benson out) What's the secret?! Why does East Pines gets visitors when we don't?! It's the uniforms, isn't it Gene?!

Gene: (sighs) Yeah, Benson, it's the uniforms.

(The guys laugh maniacally)

Benson: Ha! So you admit it!

(Gene and his two employees look at each other confused)

Gene: What are you talking about?

Benson: It's too late! We know your secret! Let's get outta here!

(He and the guys run back to the Park, then circle-wipe transitions back to the house, then cut to the guys in the computer room. The guys are mumbling)

Benson: Hey! Hey! Quiet! We only have 12 more hours to save the Park. Now... (He holds up and opens a can of soda) ...who's ready to stay up all night designing uniforms?

Guys: Uniforms! WOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

(Montage begins with the guys selecting and deciding different designs and what to add to design their uniforms on the computer with a whispering voice saying different words from the YOUnique website until the scene fades to the next day where guys outside the house as the montage ends.)

Benson: Well, guys, this is it, our last day, so I don't know, rake some leaves or something.

(Huge Head is still behind the bushes, breathing heavily as the Zip Delivery truck arrives and the delivery guy drops 7 separate boxes on the ground and leaves)

Benson: Oh, great! Guys, the uniforms!

Guys: (running up to the boxes) Uniforms!

Benson: Huh. Maybe, it won't be our last day after all.

Skips: Weird they put them all in separate boxes.

Hi-Five Ghost: (looks at a label on one of the boxes) Looks like there's some kind of warning.

(The label says "Caution: Contents of this package exceed ugly index and should not be combined with other items of similar rating. Avert eyes!")

Rigby: Blah, blah, blah! Do you wanna read a bunch of words, or do you wanna save the Park? (opens the lid of the box)

(The guys put on their uniforms, and the uniforms turned out to be ugly)

Pops: Oh, my. These didn't turn out well at all.

Rigby: I don't understand. They look so cool on the computer last night.

Muscle Man: (taking a picture of Rigby in his ugly uniform) Smile, bro! My friend, Scottie is gonna love this.

(Cut to Scottie typing on his computer at his place. His phone rings, he picks it up and sees the picture of Rigby in his ugly uniform)

Scottie: Heh. Classic. Mmm-hmm. (He shares the picture)

Muscle Man: Check it out! Your picture is going viral!

Rigby: Stop talking!

Mordecai: Woah, Benson, look! We've got visitors.

(A family arrives in their RV, come out and are taking pictures of the guys in their ugly uniforms)

Benson: Huh. Looks like the uniforms are already working.

Skips: Hey, there's more!

(A line of cars, buses and campers arrive at the Park as lots of people come out of their vehicles and take lots of pictures of the guys in their ugly uniforms)

Rigby: Woah, this is crazy!

Anonymous #1: Dude, whenever they're paying you to wear those ugly uniforms, it's not enough!

(They both laugh)

Anonymous #2: They're even more heinous than that internet picture!

Mordecai: Aw, what?! Muscle Man! These people are just here to make fun of our uniforms because of your dumb picture.

Muscle Man: Whatever. Any publicity is good publicity.

Anonymous #3: (he touches Muscle Man's shoulder) Hey! I wanna picture with double-wide!

Muscle Man: (shoves the man towards the crowd) Get off me, bro!

(The people start laughing at them as they're continuing to take pictures of them)

Benson: Alright, alright, let's all settle down. We're glad you're visiting the Park. (A dodgeball gets thrown at him) Who threw that?

(People continue to take pictures of them and making fun of them)

Rigby: Augh! No more pictures!

Skips: Now seems like a good time to leave.

Mordecai: Agreed.

(The guys start to run away)

Anonymous #4: They're getting away!

Anonymous #1: Hey! I'm not done making fun of 'em!

Anonymous #5: Get 'em!

(The people start to chase the guys)

Anonymous #6: Where are they going?!

Muscle Man: Hey, guys! The houndstooth codpiece was a great idea, but it's making it hard to run from this angry mob!

Mordecai: Ditch the uniforms?

Muscle Man: Bingo!

Benson: Okay, fine! But it's a colossal waste of money!

(They start to take off their ugly uniforms)

Anonymous #7: They're they are!

(The guys throw their ugly uniforms into the ground, combining, then the uniforms are glowing)

Mordecai: Uh, guys, what's going on?

Skips: Those clashing colors and styles are highly unstable! Run!

(They run behind a tree as the people run to the uniforms and the clashing colors is transformed into a black hole of ugliness and starts to suck the people in)

Skips: It's a black hole of ugliness! It only sucks in ugly things.

(A guy's shirt, a Sphynx cat and another man is sucked into the black hole)

Skips: Yeah, but we're safe. We're not ugly.

Muscle Man: (holding on to the tree) Oh, yeah, bros! We got nothing to worry about!

Rigby: We have to find a way to plug up that hole!

Benson: Agreed. In the mean time, Muscle Man try to be more... attractive?

(Muscle Man nods, grabs a comb and brushes his hair. As the black hole continues to suck in the people, Huge Head comes out of the bushes and starts to sneak up on Pops. The guys go to shed and Benson opens the shed to find an opossum and it's babies inside it and hisses at them as the guys screamed, then the black hole sucks the opossum and it's babies in. As Huge Head continues to sneak up on Pops, the guys run towards the hole with shovels)

Benson: Fill it in!

(The guys tried to dig the dirt to plug up the black hole, but failed, then two hipsters and a male model appeared)

Hipster Female: Look at these dweebs.

Male Model: I'm a male model, and even I know you can't fill up a magic portal.

Hipster Male: Yeah, losers!

(The two hipsters and the male model get sucked into the black hole)

Skips: Guess they were ugly on the inside.

Muscle Man: Bros! Bros! I think I might be the right size and shape to plug up that hole! I'm too, you know, appearance-challenged for this world anyway, right?

(The guys mumble in disagreement, then the tree starts to break as the guys gasp shockingly)

Muscle Man: Stop trying to protect my feelings, bros! It's science! I'm gonna let go!

(The guys hesitate at Muscle Man's idea and start to run to Muscle Man to save him)

Skips: No!

(Huge Head runs behind Pops and grabs him by the neck)

Huge Head: Gotcha! I've waited a long time for this! Huh?

Muscle Man: Time to see what's on the other side. (He lets go of the tree and heads towards the black hole.)

Huge Head: (As he and Pops are pulled by the black hole) What is this?!

Pops: Who are you?!

Huge Head: You took my life away from me! Now I'm gonna return the favor! (Laughs evily) Huh?

(He and Pops see Muscle Man about to be sucked into the black hole, but bumps into Pops, making Huge Head let go of Pops and he is about to be sucked into the black hole. He is completely sucked into the hole as the scene cuts to black, then we cut to the turnstile getting 6981 visitors as people come into the Park. A fair is happening)

Mr. Maellard: (shaking hands with Benson) Well, I don't know how you did it. We have never had more visitors.

Pops: (excitedly) Oh, Papa, does that mean?

Mr. Maellard: That we'll be open for years to come, yes! This park is wonderful! (sips his tea) Oh, this tea is wonderful too.

Benson: Thanks for noticing the tea, sir.

Mr. Maellard: How did you all think of it?

Benson: Well, we just asked ourselves "what do we have that other parks don't?"

(Cut to Huge Head's head stuck in the black hole as Huge Head is seen by the people)

Huge Head: (chuckling) Finally! The attention I deserve! I'm so happy! He he.

(Episode ends)


(Episode starts in The Coffee Shop on a snowy day. Mordecai and Rigby are singing a Christmas rap, beat-boxing)

Mordecai: Wrap up the presents throw em under the tree, drink up the egg nog have one, two, or three

Rigby: Christmas time is near spreadin holiday cheer, yo Eileen get that fruitcake outta here! (to Eileen holding a fruitcake)

Eileen: Whaaaaaat? Fruitcake is the best part of the holidays.

Mordecai and Rigby: (still rapping) Fruitcake, fruitcake we don't wanna partake of your own fruitcake.

Rigby: When a fruitcake comes out knocking, you just stuff that in your stockin....

Mordecai and Rigby: ....and BOOM! No fruitcake! (they both laugh)

Eileen: Well, more for me. (as she takes a piece of fruitcake and puts it into her mouth) By the way, I got three things I want to tell you. First and for most is that my awesome Christmas sweater party is tonight, so be sure to dress for the occasion. (she lights up some Christmas lights on her sweater)

Rigby: Feastiiiiiivvvvveeeee

Mordecai: Awwww yay-yuh! Count me and CJ in on the party, it's our first Christmas together and it's gonna be awesome. (he makes a small tosting motion with his mug and sips some coffee)

Eileen: (looking worried) The second thing I wanted to tell you......is that Margaret is gonna be there.

(Mordecai spits coffee from his mouth and flashbacks about his time with Margaret)

Mordecai: M-M-M- Margaret? Margaret's gonna be there?! Oh no!! I should've known she'd be home for the holidays! If she's at the party and CJ's at the party and I'm at the party, it's gonna be.....

Rigby: ......a party?

Mordecai : Aaauuuggghhh! This is terrible! If I see Margaret and act all weird around her, CJ's gonna think I still like her!

Rigby: Dude you're making it a too big a deal out of it. I'm sure it'll be fine.

Mordecai: M-Maybe if I just avoid her nothing bad will happen.

Eileen: Or you could just talk to her now.

Mordecai: Wait, What?!

Eileen: Yeah, she's on her way over here right now.

Mordecai: Aaaahhh!!! I-I-I...uh I need some air I gotta go! (while hypervinalating)

Eileen: Wait! I still gotta tell you the third thing!

(Scene cuts to the house, Mucleman, High-Five Ghost, Mordecai and Rigby are decorating the roof of house while discussing about the party)

Muscle Man: Man, tonights party is gonna be off the chain. My first Christmas as an engaged man with my fiancee

High-Five Ghost: Yeah, Celia made gluten free Christmas cookies. They taste just as good though.

Rigby: Yeah! There's gonna be a fancy soda table. It's gonna be fuuuuuunnn.

(Mordecai stares in fright as he imagines a scenario what might happen if the girls met)

CJ: This is the best party ever! I'm so glad I get to spend Christmas with you, Mordecai.

(Margaret is standing behind Mordecai)

Margaret: Mordecai?

(Mordecai turns his head towards her and screams in horror)

CJ: (looking mad) Who's this, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Ummm, CJ, this is Margaret, my girlfriend. (Mordecai sinks into the floor, creating a hole) I mean my ex-girlfriend. (He sinks deeper) I mean a girl I kissed a bunch of times in the past who is my friend (He sinks even deeper) Should I stop talking now?

(Mordecai screams as egg nog pours out of Margaret's and CJ's cups)

CJ: I never want to speak to you again, Mordecai!

Margaret: Yeah, way to make things weird!

Mordecai: Noooooooooooooooooo!

(He wakes up)

Mordecai: NO!

Muscle Man: No, don't move it to the left? (holding a fake Santa) Well, it might fall, but okay.

(The Santa fell causing the Christmas lights tangling Muscleman and High Five Ghost and knocking Mordecai and Rigby off the roof and onto the ground. The four park workers groan in pain. Just then, Benson comes out of the house)

Muscle Man: I should've moved it to the left.

Benson: Hey, be careful. That Santa wasn't cheap. Mordecai and Rigby, I need you guys to take this package to the post office.

Rigby: I gotta wrap Eileen's gift.

Benson: Mordecai?

Mordecai: I can't go! What if I run into Margaret?!

Rigby: What?! She's not gonna be lurking around every corner of the city.

Benson: I agree with Rigby. Oh also, JUST DO YOUR JOB!

(Scene changes to Mordecai calming down while walking to the post office)

Mordecai: Get a hold of yourself Mordecai. She's just a person. Your just a person. Two people, no big deal.

(The door of the post office opens and Margaret appears)

Margaret: Mordecai?

(Mordecai immediately closes the door in surprise while sweating. He opens the door, still looking shocked)

Margaret: Umm hi.

Mordecai: (sounding nervous) Hey, what a coincidence! I knew you'd be coming back into my life, I mean back into town, welcome back!

Margaret: Thanks. (She attempts to hug Mordecai but he quickly shakes her hand instead.) Oh um... Well, I guess we've never been good at that, huh? Wow, I have so much to tell you. Oh did Eileen tell you about-

Mordecai: Uh, mostly. Whoops, I got a phone call. It's from Benson. A call from "The man." I got to take it, haha! Benson? I've got to go the post office across town? Well, I've got to run Margaret! Literally! I, uh really got into running after you left. It's a health thing. Bye!

(Mordecai leaves the post office and the scene cuts to his and Rigby's room. Rigby is having a hard time wrapping Eileen's gift and tape sticks all over his body, making a mess)
Rigby: UUUUGGGHH, Christmas is so hard!

(Mordecai enters quickly and pants while slaming the door)

Rigby: Oh good! You're just in time to help me with this, grab some tape.

Mordecai: Dude, I just saw Margaret at the post office.

Rigby: Lemme guess, you pulled a Mordecai?

Mordecai: Yeaahhh, I faked a call from Benson and then I ran away from her.

Rigby: Classic Mordecai.

Mordecai: Auugghh! There's no way I can go to this party.

(Mordecai's phone rings)

Mordecai: Hello?

CJ: Hey Mordecai. Are you excited for the party tonight? I know I am. (While making a gingerbread house)

Mordecai: (nervously) What?

CJ: Eileen's party. She told you about it right?

Mordecai: (nervously and sweating) Oh, yeah, haha! A totally normal party where nothing bad will ever happen.

CJ: Uuhhh yeah. You gonna pick me up, or should we just meet there?

Mordecai: Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...............

(Rigby takes Mordecai's phone)

Rigby: (imitating Mordecai) We'll meet there dude ha ha. Okay bye.

Mordecai: Aww dude, why'd you do that?!

(Rigby slaps him sticking some tape and a card that says: "To Eileen" on his face)

Rigby: Because you're acting like a dumb baby! I'm gonna lay the hard truth on you Mordecai, you're wimpin' up the holidays! You're dating CJ now and if you really care about her you'll go to the party with her. So Margaret will be there. Big deal! She'll be gone after that and you'll probably never see her again.

Mordecai: Yeah but- (Rigby slaps him again, sticking more tape on his face)

Rigby: Dude, just go to the party.

(Scene cuts to Eileen's house during the Christmas party. Inside there are tons of guests enjoying the party. Scene then shows Muscle Man and Starla talking to HFG and Celia)

Muscle Man: Yeah, not to brag or nothing, but Starla and I are planning the best wedding of all time.

(Scene cuts to the front door, the doorbell rings, Mordecai and Rigby appear)

Mordecai and Rigby: Merry Christmaaaaaaass!

Eileen: You made it! Gimme your coats, I'll put them in the spare room. (They hand her their coats) By the way Mordecai, I never got to tell you the third thing from this morning.

Rigby: Hold that thought Eileen, and open this gift wrapped by yours truly! (shoves present towards Eileen)

Eileen: Oh! (opens the present) *gasp* You didn't!

Rigby: I did.

Eileen: This mistletoe disco ball is just what I needed! Thanks Rigby!

(Mordecai hangs the disco ball on the ceiling and turns it on. It gives off a soft green glow)

Rigby and Eileen: Woooooooaaaahh

CJ: (As Mordecai comes down the ladder, CJ catches him off guard) BOO!

Mordecai: WAUH!

CJ: Hahahaha! Geez, someone's on edge tonight. Did Santa give you jitters for Christmas?

Mordecai: (nervously laughs) haha, ha, no, no he didn't.

CJ: Are you sure nothing's wrong?

(At that moment, Margaret walks through the front door.)

Mordecai: Uuuhhh...

CJ: Huh?

Mordecai: (Out of panic, he takes CJ's arm and kisses her.)

CJ: Woah, your face is really sweaty.

Mordecai: (continues to be nervous) Is it? Hehehe, I must be really thirsty. Uuuuuhh, let's go to the fancy soda table. It's on me, haha! (They begin to walk away)

CJ: .....But it's free...

Mordecai: (in a rushed tone) Come on, let's go. (they look at the different sodas) Yeti Ginger Ale....Mountain Man Ginger Ale......Imitation Ginger Ale?

CJ: Who knew there were so many flavors of Ginger Ale!

Mordecai: Heh, yeah, who knew.

Margaret: (from behind) Hey Mordecai!

Mordecai: (tenses up) Uuuuuuuhhhh...(turns around and faces Margaret) Hey!

(CJ looks confused while this goes down)

Margaret: I'm glad you're here. I wanted to talk to you earlier at the Post Office, but it seemed like you were in a rush.

Mordecai: Uuuhh, (crosses arms and nods) yup.

(Couple of moments of silence pass by)

Margaret: (acknowledges CJ) Hi! I'm Margaret, by the way. It's nice to meet you.

(Mordecai looks at the two, stunned that things are not crazy)

CJ: Uh, CJ, Mordecai's girlfriend.

Margaret: (Margaret seems stunned and a bit upset by this) Girlfriend?....

Mordecai: (becomes nervous again by this) You two know each other. I mean, you've meet before, at The Coffee Shop, when I..invited...you both..to the same...movie....(realises how awkward it is now)

Margaret: Oh...

CJ: Yeeaaahh....that...

(A moment of awkwardness passes for the three of them)

Margaret: (awkwardly) Um...it was nice meeting you...officially...I'm gonna go there for a bit (points to the left)...excuse me (leaves)

CJ: So that's why you've been acting so weird.

Mordecai: WHAT! I'm not weird!

(CJ looks at him seriously. Mordecai looks back for a bit, then speaks)

Mordecai: (fastly) Okyes. (normal voice) I haven't seen her since we broke up, and I don't know what to do. I was worried that me acting weird would give you the wrong impression, like I still like her or something.

CJ: (kind of upset) Well................do you?

Mordecai: No! I don't feel that way about her anymore. I'm with you, that's all I care about.

CJ: (kisses Mordecai) That's all I needed to know. (They smile at each other) Now come on! (takes Mordecai's hands) This is a party, let's go have some fun!

(A montage ensues, with different scenes of Mordecai, Rigby, CJ, and Eileen partying. The four of them dance under the disco ball. A small conga line with Starla, Muscle Man, and three others forms, and Celia and HFG are dancing together. Mordecai and CJ have some eggnog. Rigby plays with two gingerbread men while the other three watch. He eats one of the heads and the other three laugh. Montage then ends. The four of them are by the eggnog table.)

Mordecai: (pours eggnog into a glass) Care for another glass?

CJ: Actually, I've gotta use the restroom. (A long line to the restroom is shown)

Mordecai: Better take a number, that's a long line.

CJ: (shrugs) I'll take my chances. Be back soon! (leaves)

(A gleam from the disco ball reflects off of Mordecai's glass and into his eye. He looks up at it. Scene then shows Muscle Man and Starla on a love seat.)

Muscle Man: Merry Musclemas, my sweet.

Starla: How about a bit of that holiday sugar?

Muscle Man: HOHOHO to that! (he pulls down his santa hat and covers both of them up and they start to make out)

(scene cuts to Celia and High Five Ghost at a doorway)

HFG: (blushing) Oh, uh, is that a new lipgloss, or.....WAH! (Celia pulls him in and kisses him)

Mordecai: Pfft, dude, check out Fives. Hehe. (Rigby doesn't hear him because he is talking and laughing with Eileen) Dude?

Rigby: Huh? Oh, yeah sure.

Mordecai: (smiles) Hey Eileen, is that mistletoe in your hair?

Eileen: As a matter of fact, it is, good eye.

Mordecai: Haha, Rigby, it's mistletoe.

Rigby: Yeah, so?

Mordecai: You know that people have to kiss under mistletoe, right?

Rigby: Yeah, but it's not like a rule rule.

Mordecai: (makes chicken noises and flaps his wings) BukbukbuKA!

Rigby: Ugh, fine. (kisses Eileen on the cheek, Eileen blushes) Hmm, hmm!

Mordecai: Alright, alright, you're good. On that note though, I should find my lady. (looks around) Where's mah lady at? Can't kiss under the mistletoe disco ball without my lady. (leaves them to look for CJ. Goes into the hall) CJ? (walks out, at the same time runs into Margaret, he begins to sweat)

Margaret: Hey Mordecai.

Mordecai: (Mordecai looks up at the mistletoe disco ball, then at Margaret) AH! (he backs away into a lady, she spills her drink onto a guy, the guy loses balance and sends the eggong ladle flying, it hits the disco ball, the disco ball falls down, hits Muscle Man's stomach, then finally lands into the bowl of eggnog. The disco ball begins to glow red, Mordecai and Margaret are blinded by the light)

Mordecai and Margaret: AAAAAAHH!!

Mordecai: (scene then shows Mordecai and a red background) ah....huh? (he then notices a ton of Margaret's reflections surrounding him. All of them speak at once)

Margaret: Mordecai, are you ok?

Mordecai: Uh...yeah, I'm fine. Why you ask?

Margaret: You're acting weird. Why don't you just talk to me?

Mordecai: Uh, I can't right now. Uh...I gotta go. (he tries to walk away from them, but they are still around him)

Margaret: Please Mordecai, I don't want things to be like this.

Mordecai: It's just....things are complicated between us now, ok? (he walks towards the disco ball in the bowl)

Margaret: Not if you just talk to me. Come on, don't shut me out.

Mordecai: (tries to turn the disco ball off) (to himself) Gotta make it stop. Where are the batteries to this thing!

Margaret: Look, Mordecai, I know things didn't end the way we wanted them to, but at least we had some good times together, didn't we?

Mordecai: (slowly looks up)

Margaret: Doesn't that mean anything to you?

Mordecai: (thinks for a bit, then closes his eyes) (seriously) Yeah, it does mean something to me. But things are different now. (Faces the reflections) A lot has happened since we broke up. It was really rough for me at first, but since I've been dating CJ I feel a lot happier now. She's good for me. I just...hope you can understand that.

Margaret: I do understand. I didn't think you were gonna wait for me. (sincerely) I'm really glad for you Mordecai. You deserve to be happy. (They smile at each other. Margaret then takes the batteries out, and Eileen's house is shown again Mordecai drops the disco ball)

Mordecai: I'm sorry for acting weird.

Margaret: Weeell, it wouldn't be the first time.

Mordecai: Haha, and it won't be the last!

Mordecai and Margaret: Hahaha! (They hug each other)

Margaret: Mmmm (they break the hug, but are still holding each other) We had some good times together.

Mordecai: Yeah......we did.

Margaret: Merry Christmas.

Mordecai: Merry Christmas.

(A montage of Mordecai and Margaret's best moments ensues. They are shown riding bikes, having pizza and laughing, visiting an aquarium, dancing with a gold guy, and taking multiple pictures in a photo booth. These are from "Steak Me Amadeus". The kiss from "Meteor Moves" is then shown. The montage ends, and Mordecai and Margaret are shown kissing each other. After a couple seconds, they pull away.)

Mordecai: (hold hands up halfway in defense) No! I-I didn't mean to do it! I just-

Margaret: Oh my gosh! I knew it wasn't..I mean-

CJ: .............Mordecai? (Mordecai looks at CJ, devastated. Margaret looks down and covers the sides of her face in shame. CJ looks at them, heartbroken. She turns grey and storms out)

Margaret: No! It's not- (covers all her face)

Mordecai: CJ! WAIT! (he runs after CJ, leaving Margaret there. Everyone else looks at the mess. Muscle Man looks out of the Santa hat)

Muscle Man: Awkward. (He then goes back to making out with Starla)

(Mordecai runs out the front door, and looks around for CJ. She is shown driving off in her black car, leaving Mordecai there. Mordecai facepalms)

Mordecai: UUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHH!!!......CALL HER! I GOTTA CALL HER! (starts to look for his phone) Ugh, where's my phone?!

Rigby: (near front door) You ok man?

Mordecai: (Mordecai runs inside) NOT NOW! I GOTTA GET MY PHONE! (he goes into Eileen's spare room. He grabs his coat off of a box that says "Margaret's Winter Clothes") Huh?...."Margaret's"? (He looks around the room and see's a bunch of boxes belonging to Margaret. There is a picture of Margaret and her dad in a box named "Margaret's Bedroom Stuff") (slowly) What's Margaret's stuff doing in here?

Eileen: (appears at the doorway) (slowly) Yeeeeeeaaahh, that's the third thing I wanted to tell you. Margaret's my new roommate, she's finishing her degree by working at the news station, and she'll be staying here. (Mordecai is shown to have a shocked expression on his face. A couple of awkward moments of silence pass by) (awkwardly) I gotta go check out the soda table. (leaves Mordecai alone)

(Margaret is seen at the end of the hall. She stares at Mordecai and he stares back. No words are exchanged)

(End of "Merry Christmas Mordecai")

(The episode starts off at the Coffee Shop and Margaret, Mordecai and Rigby are laughing. Mordecai is telling a story about Skips defeating monsters... as usual)

Mordecai: And so Skips goes, "if you make me fight one of those things again, you better hope it kills me."

(All three laugh)

Margaret: Nice one.

(Then Eileen comes running in from another room)

Eileen: Guys, guys! You ready for tonight?

Mordecai: What's tonight?

Eileen: The meteor shower! I sent you guys like 5 texts about it.

Rigby: (Rigby reads the messages on his phone) Oh, yeah, once in a lifetime meteor shower. What's the big deal about this one again?

Eileen: The meteors fly much closer due to the tragic deterioration of our region's ozone layer.

Rigby: Nice, that sounds awesome.

Eileen: The peak of the meteors shower is at midnight tonight, I know a great place where we could watch: Lookout Mountain.

Margaret: Oh, you mean Make-out Mountain; I've totally been there.

Mordecai: Uhhh, uhhh, Make-out Mountain? Sounds like a great spot; count me in.

Rigby: Sure, me too.

Margaret: Haha, are you sure you won't be scared, Mordecai? Up on a mountain top in the dark.

Mordecai: No, what's there to be scared of, a bunch people sitting in their cars making out. Why would I be scared of that?

Eileen: Well, we gotta get back to work.

Margaret: Yeah, see you there, dudes.

Rigby: Friend zone.

Mordecai: What, no way.

Rigby: Dude, she called you dude, dude. That says it all.

Mordecai: We can't be in the friends zone. We already kissed, remember at the airport.

Rigby: Oh yeah, you kissed her, is that what happened?

(Mordecai then remembers when Margaret kissed him in "Picking Up Margaret")

Mordecai: Oh man, you're right. She kissed me. But it was still a kiss, same diff.

Rigby: No man, different diff, you were dropping her off at the airport, that was a goodbye kiss, and that was like two weeks ago. You've done anything about it since?

Mordecai: Uhhhh...

Rigby: No huh, probably cause you're not into her, cause that's what she's thinking.

Mordecai: Ugh! Why am I even talking to you about this?

Rigby: Come on, it's easy! Just go (Rigby starts imitating Mordecai and Margaret using his hands) "Margaret, sorry I've been a wus about kissing you", and she'll be all "That's okay, Mordecai, I'm way into losers", and then you'll be all (Rigby starts making kissing noises until Mordecai punches him) Ow!

Mordecai: Knock it off!

Rigby: Come on! I'm just trying to keep you out of the friend zone, man.

Mordecai: There is no friend zone, I'm gonna kiss Margaret tonight, and its gonna be awesome. (The setting changes to Mordecai, Margaret, Rigby, and Eileen in the car. Mordecai and Rigby are singing a rap about the meteor shower) (rapping) Look up, what's that way up high, shooting stars in the sky, sailing up high.

Rigby: (rapping) There's no denying.

Mordecai: Psh!

Rigby: (rapping) Let stars be shining.

Mordecai: Psh, psh!

Rigby: (rapping) As the heavens are aligning!

Mordecai and Rigby: Shine, shine, shine! Shine, shine, sh-shimmey shine!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Margaret laugh)

Eileen: (rapping) To clear off the confusion, the stars are made of gas. They shine from thermo-nuclear fusion.

(Short silence)

Rigby: Uhh, thanks for clearing that up, Eileen.

(As the scene goes along, they all head up to Look out Mountain then Margaret parks the car in the lot and now Mordecai and Rigby get out and see how the view is among the atmosphere.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Mordecai: This is awesome! (Mordecai sets down a blanket) Aw yeah! Best seat in the house! Haha.

Eileen: Alright! Perfect view! (sits down)

Rigby: Hey, don't hog the whole blanket. (sits down)

Margaret: So Eileen, when are the meteors supposed to show up?

Eileen: Not for another hour. In the meantime, I like to take down new stars in my star log. In my astronomy club, we pick uncharted stars and name them and I got to name that greenish one (points at it) "Romulus 5". Best 80 dollars I spent.

Rigby: I wanna name a star! I'm gonna name that moving one (points at it) "Stargoz the Destructor".

Eileen: Umm, that's a satellite Rigby. (Margaret and Eileen laugh) This is gonna be a historic meteor shower. Two celestial bodies will converge for the first time ever. (Unfortunately for Mordecai, her nerd-speak about stars turns into an almost a direct reference to Mordecai's situation. He has a depressed expression on his face) Which means if they don't get together now, they will never get together again. And then, they will burn down and die. Which of its-

Mordecai: (in his head) Man, I'm never gonna kiss Margaret while Eileen talking star-gibberish. (Mordecai thinks up a distraction just to talk to Rigby in private) Uhh, hey anybody want snacks? Snacks? Snacks? I know I want snacks. Rigby does too.

(Mordecai pulls Rigby as he screams while Mordecai takes him farther away to Margaret's car)

Rigby: What's your problem man?!

Mordecai: Dude, I can't kiss Margaret with you and Eileen here. I want you two to go somewhere else or something.

Rigby: What, no! I'm fine just where I am. I don't wanna walk all far just for you to not do anything! (Mordecai punches Rigby) Oww!

(Mordecai throws a bag of "choco-ducks" to Rigby)

Mordecai: Here! Take these "Choco-gooey-choco-ducks" and get out of here.

Rigby: Ugh, you're lucky I like "Choco-gooey-choco-ducks".  (Mordecai and Rigby leave and go to Margaret and Eileen) (stubbornly) Hey Eileen, lets go up there. (points at a higher hill) We'll get a better view.

Eileen: Oh good idea! Maybe we'll see Orion's belt!

Rigby: (to Mordecai) Friend zone!

(Rigby and Eileen go to the higher point of the mountain. Mordecai then sees Margaret looking at the stars. Seeing his chance, he sits down beside her)

Mordecai: It's really nice up here.

Margaret: Yeah.

(short silence)

Mordecai: You're kinda quiet. What are you thinking about?

Margaret: Oh, I don't know, the future.

Mordecai: Oh man, have you seen "Space Warrior 2"? That's a great futuristic film!

Margaret: I mean't my future.

Mordecai: Oh. Heh. Oh.

Margaret: I applied to 3 schools, but I haven't heard anything back yet.

Mordecai: Eh don't worry. I'm sure you'll hear something soon. You know what they say "envelopes thin, didn't get in, envelopes fat, school is where it's at!"

Margaret: (laughs) What? People don't say that.

Mordecai: Haha. But it's true though. You shouldn't worry. College is a lot of fun. I had lots of fun at Arts school before I left.

Margaret: You think you'll ever go back?

Mordecai: Oh, I don't know, maybe. Maybe I'll just stay working for the park for the rest of my life. (both of them laugh) Yeah.

(They both turn to see in a different direction)

Margaret: It's just weird of not knowing what's gonna happen. What if I don't get into any of them? I think I sounded really dumb in those interviews.

Mordecai: You never sound dumb Margaret. I'm sure you did fine. (Mordecai grabs two cans of soda from the cooler next to them) So uhh, how 'bout a toast?

(Mordecai gives a soda to Margaret)

Margaret: Whoa, fancy. (laughs)

Mordecai: Only the finest of beverages for the future journalism major.

Margaret: Stop it! (laughs)

Mordecai: So, uhh, what should we toast to?

Margaret: How 'bout...to us being good friends...forever!

(Mordecai is obviously depressed about this statement)

Mordecai: Yeah...friends.

Mordecai and Margaret: (toast) Cheers!

(They open their tip of the can but unfortunately, Margaret's soda squirts out.)

Mordecai: Aw man, I'm so sorry!

Margaret: Don't worry, it's fine. There's some paper towels in the-

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah.

(Mordecai gets up and goes to Margaret's car to grab the paper towels. Meanwhile, Eileen is working on her star log, and Rigby has a pair of binoculars to see what's going on with Mordecai and Margaret)

Eileen: I'm not sure this is any better than where we were sitting before, Rigby.

Rigby: Naw, it's fine, just keep looking. (Rigby sees that Margaret is sitting by herself and Mordecai is in her car upset, much to Rigby's disappointment) Aw what?!

Eileen: What's the matter?

Rigby: Uhh, we're out of snacks. Stay here, I'll be right back.

(Rigby gives Eileen the pair of binoculars as he runs down the hill leading to Margaret's car)

Eileen: Okay, but hurry! I think they're entering the Mesosphere!

(Rigby gets in Margaret's car)

Rigby: What's up man? Taken down by all the tongue-wrestling yet with Margaret?

Mordecai: Dude, knock it off! I haven't kissed her yet.

Rigby: Yeah, well what have you been doing?

Mordecai: Talking. We're having a serious conversation.

Rigby: Talking huh? Sounds like what people do in the friend zone.

Mordecai: Will you stop it with the friend zone! There's no such thing!

Rigby: Look man, stop wasting time! You have a great chance tonight! Don't blow it like you always do!

Mordecai: I'm working on it, lay off!

Rigby: Stop working on it and start making out! (Mordecai gets out of the car) Before the door closes! (Mordecai closes the car door) (grunts) Where are those chips?

(Mordecai goes to Margaret with the paper towels)

Mordecai: Hey, hey! Clean up on aisle Margaret! (laughs)

Margaret: Thanks! (Margaret gets a paper towel and wipes herself then she starts shivering) Man, it got cold huh?

Mordecai: Hehe. Yeah. (Mordecai is seeing the chance to set it up) (in his head) Put your arm around her. Put your arm around her! (Unfortunately, this doesn't go as planned) (to Margaret) Uhh, you could...wear a bunch of these paper towels! (Rips off pieces of paper towels) Like it makeshift quilt! Haha.

(He throws the paper towels to her and it flows down to her. Mordecai is obviously facedesking in his mind, as well as the audience)

Margaret: Hehe...yeah.

Mordecai: (in his head) Ugh! What is wrong with you? How long is it gonna take for you to finally kiss her?

(Scene goes to Rigby watching them with the binoculars)

Rigby: Dude, come on! Just kiss her already!

(Scene changes to Mordecai and Margaret)

Margaret: Mordecai, we're friends right?

Mordecai: Umm...yeah (Once again, he is depressed) yeah we're friends.

Margaret: I can tell you anything right?

Mordecai: Of course.

Margaret: There's one reason I don't wanna leave.

Mordecai: (in his head) This is it. She's setting you up. Just pull the trigger.

Margaret: I...I would really miss you Mordecai.

(Completely taken back by the moment, love music starts playing, he pulls the trigger, and holds her hand. The two are about to kiss when an asteroid comes out of nowhere. The two are surprised as it nearly kills them)

Mordecai and Margaret: Ahh!

Eileen: It's beautiful!

Rigby: I can't take this anymore! MORDECAI! FRIEND ZONE! FRIEND ZONE! FRIEND ZONE! (Rigby got everyone their attention) FRIEND ZONE! FRIEND ZONE!

Margaret: Why is he saying "friend zone"?

Mordecai: Dude, quit it!

Rigby: NO!! I can't stand this anymore! You're not gonna mess this up again, man! Just go for it!

(Everyone in their car plead to Mordecai to do it.)

Mordecai: I just need more time!

Rigby: There is no more time! Dude, I'm just trying to save you from the friend zone!

Mordecai: Dude! For the last time, there is no friend zone! (Suddenly, the meteor shower goes around Margaret and Mordecai and zaps them into 2 green quadrilateral moving surfaces. Mordecai bangs on the surface)  Margaret?! (Margaret can't hear him but is scared like Mordecai) Margaret!

Guardian of the Friend Zone: She can't hear you! You guys are just friends.

Mordecai: Huh?

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Welcome, Mordecai. I'm the Guardian of the Friend Zone.

Mordecai: What?? The friend zone's not a real place!

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Aw but it is, a place of friendly handshakes, back pats, side hugs, a pletonic relm where romance goes to die.

Mordecai: Let us out! I don't wanna be here!

Guardian of the Friend Zone: I'm sorry Mordecai. You waited too long.

Mordecai: NOO!! No! I wanted to kiss her so many times. But, I never got a good opening.

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Aw, but you did. (He zaps a few clips from "Camping Can Be Cool","Death Bear" & "Do or Diaper" where Mordecai had a chance to kiss her.) Each time, you hesitated. You let all those opportunities past. (He unzaps them away) You just didn't believe in yourself. You must be brave enough to show your true feelings. Only then, you will be freed out of the friend zone.

Mordecai: It's just...I liked Margaret for so long. What if she's not into me?

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Aw, see that? "What if"? It's time you stop wondering "what if" and you just went for it. Then you'll know how much she feels about you.

Mordecai: How do you know? You're just a floating talking asteroid thing.

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Believe it or not, I too was in this very situation. Many times, Angie, Christine, Lola. HOW DO YOU THINK I ENDED UP BECOMING THE GUARDIAN OF THE FRIEND ZONE?! LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP YOU, FROM MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!

Mordecai: THEN LET ME OUT!!

(Mordecai grunts and bangs on the surface in regret)

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Whoa, whoa, whoa, chill out! That friendship glass is expensive! Look, I'm gonna give you another chance alright. But you better not back out.

Mordecai: No, no. I swear I'll do it.

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Haha, okay, go get her champ.

(He zaps Margaret's glass so the two can hear and speak to each other)

Margaret: Huh? (Love Music starts to play) Mordecai, where are we?

(Mordecai walks over to Margaret and the 2 glasses are now formed as a hexagon.)

Mordecai: Right where I wanna be.

(Margaret is completely taken by the moment. She is speechless knowing what's going to happen. Mordecai gets love-struck and the two have a good, long kiss)

Guardian of the Friend Zone: Mordecai, Margaret, I now pronounce you, out of the friend zone.

(The hexagon breaks as they float down to the ground still kissing. They reach the ground, and finish their first REAL kiss. The two are shown still holding each other in love. Rigby is seen in the scene)

Rigby: Hmm, hmm.

Mordecai: Uh, it's getting late. We should probably take off.

Eileen: Did you see it? Did you see it? What you think? What you think?

Margaret: It was amazing.

(The two smile at each other)

Eileen: Man, wait until my astronomy club hears about this! I never seen celestial bodies come together like that.

(Rigby and Eileen start walking away talking about the meteor shower. Mordecai and Margaret stay behind, and help pack up the cooler. By walking back together, Mordecai and Margaret hold each others hands while another meteor flows above them.)

(End of "Meteor Moves")

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby in the basement checking the inventory)

Rigby: One 3-D knitter.

Mordecai: Check.

Rigby: Five boxes of freeze-dried burritos.

Mordecai: Check.

Rigby: Oh, sweet! They've got carne asada! You want one? 

Mordecai: No, dude. If Benson catches us taking a snack break instead of doing inventory, he's going to flip his lid. Now, come on. What's next?

Rigby: Fine. One, uh, uh What the heck is this thing? 

Mordecai: I don't know.

Rigby: Hmm. Hm-Hm-Hm! 

(We then see Rigby walk through the teleporter machine and instantly disappears)

Mordecai: Rigby! Are you okay?! Rigby? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, Rigby! 

Rigby: Dude! 

Mordecai: Don't do that! Wait, how'd you get all the way over there?

Rigby: I don't know. I was over here, and there was this flash of light, and then I was over there in that other pod. 

Mordecai: Dude, do you realize what this is?!

Both: Teleporter! OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! 

(Rigby jumps off a crate and landed on the boxes Mordecai throws A football and the football hits Rigby in the head and We see Mordecai falling into and out of teleporters 3 times Rigby shoots a laser gun into the teleporter and it hits 2 soda cans)  

Mordecai: Okay. Okay. Oh, watch this! 

Rigby: No, it's my turn! Dude, this'll just take a sec!

Mordecai: No! AAGH, Rigby! Will you chill, man?! Geez! 

Rigby: No! I want to go!

Mordecai: Dude, I don't think we're supposed to go through together.

Rigby: What are you talking about?

Mordecai: I don't know. What if we got messed up or something?

Rigby: Whatever, man, we're fine. 

Mordecai: Still, I just don't think it's a good - AAGH!

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Dude, your butt! 

Rigby: Aw, what?! I got your butt!

Mordecai: Oh, great! Now I'm the one-cheek wonder. I don't want your messed up butt. 

Rigby: Don't make fun of my butt.

Mordecai: Yeah, whatever. What are we going to do about this?!

Rigby: I don't know. Maybe if we go through again, we'll change back? 

Mordecai: Good idea. Man, how do you walk around with this thing? It's all lopsided.

Rigby: You're lopsided!

Benson: What's going on in here!? Look at this mess! I knew I couldn't trust you guys with the inventory!

Mordecai: No, Benson! We're almost finished!  

Benson: No. You are done. And what is this?

Mordecai: What is what? I don't know what you're talking about.

Rigby: Yeah, Benson, it's a free country.

Benson: Whatever, just go outside and rake the leaves.

Mordecai: Aw, come on.

Rigby: Just give us 5 minutes.

Benson: No, now. MOVE IT!

(M&R slowly get out of the storage room and Benson locks the door)

Benson: Of all the idiotic things I've got to do today!

Rigby: Aw man He locked the door!

Mordecai: Dude we gotta get Benson's keys so we can get back in there!

(Scene cuts to the living room where Benson is sitting on the couch holding a sub sandwich and watching TV)

Narrator: We all know Ghosts are totally real!

(A man is taking a dog out for a walk when suddenly a ghost appears and grabs a mans leg and drags him)

Man: AHH!!! CARLOS, GET HELP!!!!

Narrator: And they're coming for you on earth! But what about in space? We'll find out on tonight's episode of "Ghosts are Totally Real and they're coming for you"!

Benson: (scoffs) Bunch of bologna! Oh, not you, Sammy. You're beautiful!

(Benson turns the TV volume up whilst M&R peek)

Rigby: Hey, what do you think he's watching?

Mordecai: Dude, we're doing a thing right now get your head in a game!

Rigby: Geez! Sorry, those ghosts look totally real and like they're coming for that guy. It looks good we should ask to tape it!

Mordecai: Dude, (groans) you see the keys to the dormitory anywhere?

(Benson takes a bite of his sandwich We pan down to the keys where it's sitting by him)

Rigby: Oh yeah! There they are! They're sitting right next to him!

Mordecai: (groans) You gotta be kidding me!

Rigby: We're never getting those keys until Benson properly sleeps with those things! (Rigby puts his hands up hitting Mordecai)
(Rigby sighs) It's hopeless! I think we should be getting used to these new butts. Well, I gotta use it!

Mordecai: Eww!! No dude! Were GETTING those keys and I'm GETTING my butt back!

Muscle Man: (Walks up to the duo) Hola, bros what going-- (Squeals) WHY ARE YOUR--

(The duo pull Muscle Man down to prevent Benson from seeing him)

(Mordecai shushes)

Mordecai: I think he's gone!

Muscle Man: Bros what happened to your butts?

Mordecai: We were taking inventory in the dormitory and then we found these teleporters but we accidentally -

Muscle Man: Ohhh!!! say no more! I'm a licensed teleportation technician. 

Rigby: What? No, you're not!

Muscle Man: Yeah, bro! It was part of my space tree training. You have to calibrate the machine with a teleporting more than one sentence life form. No doy.

Mordecai: Well, it doesn't matter if we can't get those keys.

Muscle Man: well you guys better hurry the antemedian is only gonna continue until you completely transform into each other.  

Rigby: That's not going to happen to us is it?  

Mordecai: No, dude. That's the kind of stuff that happens in dumb movies. This is real life. Those kinds of things don't happen in real life (MM and R are shocked) What?  

(Mordecai sees his hands are swapped with Rigby's and the trio start screaming)  

Mordecai: We gotta get those keys!  

(Cut back to the living room)  

Narrator: They fear of the fear of the unfortunate space faring souls across their paths.  

Benson: What the? (The lights go off and we hear breaking and crashing and punching) Hey! Oh come on, seriously? Hello? Someone there? Hey! (The lights go back on and we see the living room is trashed and Benson is rocking on the floor scared.) Space ghosts aren't real! Space ghosts aren't real!

(We cute back to the park with Mordecai and Muscle Man)

Rigby: I got the keys. Let's roll!

(The scene cuts back to the dormitory)

Mordecai: Ok, let's get this over with already! Muscle man better be right about this!

(Mordecai adjusts the teleporter settings and M&R get in the teleporters)

Mordecai: Hey i think it worked (Mordecai looks at Rigby which he's tall now) no no no no no no no no DUDE NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE!!!!!!

Rigby: I don't know man. I kinda into it. I'm finally as tall as my brother! Eat it Don wherever you are!

Mordecai: No. what? this is terrible. look at me dude! I'm a short tiny freak. (In the UK, the line is changed to "No. what? this is terrible. look at me dude! I'm a short tiny weirdo.")

Rigby: Oh, so that's what you think of me?

Mordecai: Oh come on. That's not what I meant. 

Rigby: Oh, I knew what you meant you don't like being in my shoes. 

Mordecai: I just wanna be me again. it's not fair.

Rigby: (Sighs) You're right its not fair we should play punchies for it!

Mordecai: Huh?

(Rigby punches Mordecai)

Rigby: I just think we should stay like this then.

Mordecai: (groans) Rigby. no! come back! Rigby.

Rigby: (laughing and touches the ceiling still laughing he picks up a basketball and dribbles it and dunk it) yeah

(cut back to Mordecai he trips)

Mordecai: Stupid stubby legs.

(We cut to Eileen and HFG)

Eileen: Hey fives should I throw the astronaut diapers in with the raw sewage?

HFG: Yeah, anything that has moisture.

(Eileen does so)

HFG: Now the magical of reverse princess you never know this used to be waste water.

(Eileen and HFG takes a sip until she saws Rigby which made her spit the water at HFG)

Eileen: Did you see that?

HFG: Was there something in the water? I'm gonna need to replace the filter.

(Mordecai chases after Rigby he hops on him and we pan back to Benson)

Benson: Where did I put my keys? (sighs) Let's see... I was watching TV. Did they fall into the couch?

Mordecai: Ok, fun's over, Rigby let's go back to the teleporter!

Rigby: No way, man! This is great! 

Mordecai: Come on, dude. I don't wanna be stuck in your weak little body!

Rigby: Me neither. (Rigby punches Mordecai 3 times and Mordecai chokes him)

Mordecai: Go back!

Rigby: Never!

Muscle Man: Unbelievable! I can't even count how many brutal calls in the teleporter tenascins you two are breaking right now! We need to get you two switched back stat!

Mordecai: Dude, I know! Try telling Rigby that!

Rigby: No way, man! this is the new me! I'm never losing at punchies again.

Muscle Man: No bro. This is not natural, you see? When I became a licensed teleportation technician, I took sacred post. Right now, you made a mockery of everything I stand for.

(Muscle Man run towards them)

Muscle Man: Mordecai take his hand!

Rigby: No, no! Let me go! 

Mordecai: Shut it, Rigby! Muscle Man, how's it going? 

Muscle Man:  Almost got it. Okay, baby, talk to me. Let's make this right. 

(Muscle man adjust the teleporters settings and Rigby freaks out)

Mordecai:  Dude, will you knock it off!?

(Rigby breaks the rope)


(TBA)

(We begin with Pops' House. Then we are shown Mordecai and Rigby repackaging some patio furniture. Mordecai puts a chair in a crate, and Rigby throws a chair at a side of a box.)

Rigby: I'm so tired and it's so early! I can't believe Benson is making us repackage all this patio furniture he just bought.

Mordecai: Maybe we shouldn't've stayed up 'til 4:00 A.M. last night.

(Flashback begins to Mordecai and Rigby wearing football attire and playing football in the living room)

Mordecai and Rigby: Touchdown Thursday!

(Rigby throws the ball to the ground and Mordecai waves a bag that saids "Movie Shack Hut" on it)

Mordecai: Hut, hut! Hike! Go long, go long! Brock Stettman with the long bomb! Huh!

(He throws the ball to Rigby and he tries to catch it, but he lands on the table full of snacks on it, and the ball hits his stomach and flys past him as the flashback ends)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hehehehehe. Touchdown Thursday. (sighs)

Mordecai: I wish it was Snoozing Saturday.

Rigby: We can't work under these conditions. We need to take a nap.

Mordecai: But Benson'd fire us if he saw us sleeping on the job.

Rigby: But what if we slept in the job?

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: Like.. right there. We can nap in this crate.

Mordecai: But is it safe?

Rigby: Yeah. I saw one of Pops' old movies once. It was called "Crabbot and Mostello Get Trapped in a Crate".

Mordecai: Auuh!

Rigby: But don't worry, though, they totally get out, but not before they meet the wolfman.

Mordecai: So tired! Let's just do it just for half an hour.

(They get inside the crate, close the lid, giggle, and they start to fall asleep as the scene fades to black. Over the background, the crate can be heard getting tossed into a truck, and into a plane that travels to some location, and gets tossed to the ground, then the scene fades back to Mordecai and Rigby still sleeping in a crate, then Mordecai wakes up)

Mordecai: Wha... Hehehehehe. The perfect crime.

(He opens the lid and drops it on the ground in the middle of a desert)

Rigby: Aaaaugh! It's too bright!

Bogan: Aw, chunder! Another returned shipment?! (He runs inside his house)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: What?! Mordecai, where are we?

(A kangaroo and its two joeys jump past by them, then the camera zooms out as Australian music plays to find out they are in Australia)

Mordecai and Rigby: (screaming)

(The camera zooms out a bit to two astronauts in a spaceship looking at the continent of Australia)

Astronaut 1: Hey, look, it's Australia.

(Scene cuts to Benson in his office writing on a paper, then his phone rings and he answers it)

Benson: Hello, this is Benson.

Voice: Will you accept a collect call from... (Mordecai and Rigby are panicking through the phone)

Benson: (sighs) Accept.

(The background turns into a half screen with Mordecai and Rigby on the left)

Mordecai: Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, Oh, my gosh! We're in trouble, man. Benson, we're in Australia!

Benson: Haha, very funny, guys. Listen up, missed you at work yesterday. If you don't come in Monday, don't bother coming in at all.

(Benson hangs up as the half screen leaves on the right)

Rigby: What did he say?

Mordecai: If we don't come in to work on Monday, we're fired.

Rigby: Aw, man.

Mordecai: Dude, come on. We got to get to an airport.

(They walk to a pit stop called "Outback Joey's" where a muscular man named Angus is sitting down)

Mordecai: Hey, excuse me, is there an airport around here somewhere?

(Angus speaks gibberish angrily, stabs a big soda can with his knife and drinks the soda)

Rigby: Uh, so you don't know where the airport is?

Outback Joey: (coming out of his shack) Ah, don't mind Angus, he's always mad. So how can I help you boys?

Mordecai: We're just trying to find the nearest airport.

Outback Joey: Airport, right. Nearest one's 300 clicks.

Mordecai: Clicks?

Outback Joey: Kilometers.

Mordecai and Rigby: Oh!

Rigby: We call those miles.

Outback Joey: Ah, yeah, I know Miles. He drives the bus. You could probably hop that to the airport (checks his watch) in about 15 minutes.

Rigby: Great! Just enough time for a soda. (Jumps on a stool) Joey?

Outback Joey: Certainly. Here you go, one can of fizzy. (He gives Rigby a can of soda)

Australian News Reporter: The Prime Minister will be returning to Australia tomorrow after his stomach surgery.

Angus: (bangs his fists on the counter) I'MA PUNCH THE PRIME MINISTER!!!!

Outback Joey: I believe it when I see it.

Angus: I will! (he leaves his seat)

Rigby: Punch the Prime Minister?

(Angus goes into the porta potty)

Rigby: Oh!

Mordecai: We call that going to the bathroom.

(Rigby starts drinking his soda)

(Rigby is still drinking his soda while Mordecai waits anxiously, then he finishes drinking)

Rigby: Now I gotta punch the Prime Minister.

(He goes to the porta potty as the bus arrives)

Mordecai: Aw, yeah! The bus. Rigby! Dude, come on, the bus is here.

Rigby:(from inside the porta potty) I'm not done punching the Prime Minister.

(Miles closes the bus door)

Mordecai:(As he's banging on the door) We gotta go! Rigby! (He runs to the bus)

Rigby: (coming out of the porta potty) Alright, alright. Hey, wait up!

(He runs after Mordecai as the bus leaves and they both run after the bus)

Rigby: Dude, there's no door!

Mordecai: (As he's banging on the window) Hey! Hey, where's the door?!

Miles: Door's on that side.

Rigby: Great!

(The bus speeds up, blowing dust on Mordecai on Rigby and they collapse on the road)

Mordecai: Great. Now what are we gonna do? (He looks at a sign that the airport is 300 kilometers) Dude, the airport is 300 kilometers away.

Rigby: That's only, like, 20 miles. Let's just walk it.

Mordecai: (as he and Rigby get up) Alright, but I'm not giving you a piggy-back ride.

Rigby: I'm not gonna ask for a piggy-back ride.

(They start walking on foot to the airport as they continue their journey in dehydration as time goes by, and now they're walking through the desert as Mordecai is piggy-back riding Rigby. Cut to night time, then we pan down to some rocks with Australian art on them as Mordecai and Rigby are exhausted from walking)

Mordecai: Must keep... going.

Rigby: Can't loose... our...

Mordecai: Jobs.

(They collapse on the dirt as a hallucination montage begins with a koala playing a flute, then to a rock with Mordecai and Rigby in Australian art and they're running away from a dingo, a snake and a spider, then they jump into the water, which is now in soda, then it continues with kangaroos digging with shovels, Mordecai juggling balls and Rigby dancing, then they stop and hop out, then Benson's angry face appears as he screaming and he becomes a didgeridoo as Mordecai and Rigby run inside it while the Australian football team from earlier are running away from an emu, then an aborigine blows the didgeridoo, blowing Mordecai and Rigby to Angus' fist where he raises it to punch the Prime Minister as Mordecai and Rigby fall down and hit the same spot with the rocks and the hallucination montage ends, then the scene fades to morning where they wake up and see the same aborigine come up to them while whirling his bolas)

Mordecai: (gasps) An aborigine!

(The aborigine stops whirling his bolas and grabs his water bottle out of his bag)

Rigby: Water!

(The aborigine pours some on Mordecai and Rigby's mouths as they cough)

Mordecai: Thanks, man. Dude, we gotta get to the airport!

(The aborigine doesn't understand him)

Mordecai: Uh, airport!

(The aborigine still doesn't understand him)

Rigby: Dude, we're not getting through to him. (making signal moves) Need go city! Take us to road!

(The aborigine understands him and nods)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yes!

(The aborigine leads them to find a road)

Rigby: Perfect! We'll follow this guy to a road, hitch a ride to the city, hop on a plane, and, boom, back at work, baby!

Mordecai: I hope so. I just wish we didn't have to stare at this guy's aboriginal butt the whole way.

(The camera shows the aborigine's butt, then it fades to two large bushes where they come out and see a road with a truck and two kangaroo wranglers eating)

Mordecai and Rigby: (gasp) Yes!

(They run down the hill to the wranglers)

Mordecai: Dude, we need to get to the airport!

(He and Rigby start begging at the wranglers)

Weber: Not a word. Can't make heads nor tails of what these blokes are sayin'.

Luke: It's their unintelligible accents what's got me all a gum tree, eh? What's they sayin', Wally?

Weber: Turn that gizmo off.

(Wally stops his cassette player and takes off his headphones)

Wally Tharah: These two chaps got lost in the outback and need a lift back to the airport. I think they may be chucking a sickie.

Weber: Oh, yeah, we know what that's like.

Mordecai: Dude, you can speak English?

Wally Tharah: Majored in it. PHD, Cambridge. (Takes off his nude pants) You probably thought these were real, too. Nude pants. I'm looking for investors in the states. Email me.

(He gives Mordecai his card with his information and walks away)

Rigby: Thanks, dude.

Weber: So, you blokes want a ride to the airport. You got any money?

Mordecai and Rigby: No.

Weber: Got anything to trade?

Mordecai and Rigby: No.

Weber: Well, can you at least sing us a bloomin' song?

Mordecai and Rigby: (sigh)

(The wranglers start playing their didgeridoos as Mordecai and Rigby start to sing their song)

(Song: Australian Rap by Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai: Didgeridoo or didgeri-don't, Maybe we'll get home, and maybe we won't

Rigby: Napping in a crate, Workin' not concern me

Mordecai and Rigby: Lost in the desert on a spiritual journey

Mordecai: So we give you this rhyme, And hope you'll be our chauffeur

Rigby: 'Cause if you leave us here, We'll probably die of exposure

Mordecai: Wigga, wigga

Mordecai and Rigby: Die of exposure! Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm. Yeah!

Weber: Didn't understand a word.

Luke: But we appreciate it from a sonic level.

Weber: Get in the back.

Mordecai and Rigby: Yes!

Mordecai: What do you guys haul, by the way?

(We cut to Mordecai and Rigby in the back of the truck with kangaroos staring angrily at them, then they punch Mordecai and Rigby and hop on them, beating them up.)

Luke: Hear something?

Weber: Yeah, the radio.

(He turns up the radio as they continue driving. Circle-wipe transition to the airport where they pull up, but the back door opens, letting the kangaroos out and Mordecai and Rigby get out, looking beaten up)

Weber: Oh, no! Don't let the kangaroos out!

Mordecai: Oh, sorry, man!

Rigby: Yeah, we gotta go!

(They run into the airport)

Australian News Reporter: The Prime Minister has just landed, and will be addressing his recent surgery momentarily.

(Angus drives and stops his car)

Angus: Prime Minister. Gonna punch the Prime Minister.

Mordecai: We need two tickets for your next flight to America.

Australian Ticket Counter: Last flight of the day departs and hour, arrives tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

Mordecai: Perfect!

Australian Ticket Counter: And it looks like we still have a few seats available.

Rigby: Great!

Australian Ticket Counter: Right then, two tickets will bring your total to $2,400 US.

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what?!

Mordecai: We don't have that kind of cash!

Rigby: What are we gonna do?!

Australian News Reporter: It's the Prime Minister! (The Prime Minister and his guards appear as the news workers come up to him) Mr. Prime Minsiter, Mr. Prime Minister! How was the surgery?

Prime Minister: Absolutely bonzer, thanks for asking. Now, let me address some of my constituents' concerns head-on. Don't worry, your prime minister is still as sharp as the wily platypus, our national marsupial, and is coming back as strong as the mighty boomerang, our national weapon. In fact, if you could say I have a weak spot, it'll be the scar on my stomach. (Shows a scar on his stomach) There, I'm as weak as a naked baby joey. (laughs) Punch me there, and I'd probably die.

(The news crew laugh)

Australian News Reporter: Who'd be mad enough to punch the Prime Minister?

(The kangaroos hop towards the Prime Minister)

Australian Woman: (screams) A roving band of mad kangaroos!

(The news crew run away)

Australian Guard: Protect the Prime Minister!

(The kangaroos start punching the Prime Minister's guards)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah!

(Angus appears running towards the Prime Minister as well)

Angus: Punch the Prime Minister! Punch the Prime Minister!

Rigby: Hey, that guy sure came a long way to... use... the...

(He thinks as he imagines his and Angus' heads)

Angus' Head: Punch the Prime Minister!

Rigby's Head: I've gotta punch the Prime Minister, too.

Angus' Head: Punch the Prime Minister!

(He stops thinking as he sees Angus running towards the Prime Minister, realizing it doesn't mean going to the bathroom)

Rigby: (gasps) He's gonna punch the Prime Minister!

(They see the Australian football players coming in)

Rigby: Come on!

(They run towards the Australian football players as Rigby grabs the football from them and run back)

Burke: Oi!

(They follow Mordecai and Rigby in hot pursuit)

Australian Football Players: Oi, oi, oi!

(Angus stares angrily at the Prime Minister as the kangaroos continue to punch the Prime Minister's guards and the Australian football players continue to chase Mordecai and Rigby with the football)

Australian Football Players: Oi, oi, oi!

Mordecai: Hut, hut, hike!

(Rigby gives Mordecai the football and he continues running)

Australian Football Players: Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

(They push Rigby out of the way and continue chasing Mordecai)

Mordecai: Stettman with the long bomb!

(He throws the ball with Stettman's long bomb move)

Angus: Hey! Prime Minister! (He raises his fist to punch the Prime Minister as his scar is still showing)

Prime Minister: Noooooooooo! That'll kill me!

(As Angus is about to punch the Prime Minister, the football hits Angus' helmet, causing him to miss, punches himself in the face as the kangaroos hop away and Angus slides down the stairs. Mordecai, Rigby and the football team gasp)

Australian News Reporter: It's Angus!

Australian News Reporter #2: Still sore you lost the election, mate?

(They laugh)

Burke: These two yanks just saved the Prime Minister!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!

(Everyone in the airport cheers as two football players carry Mordecai and Rigby to the stairs next to the Prime Minister)

Prime Minister: Thank you both for saving my life. Now, tell me, to whom does all of Australia owe this unplayable debt of gratitude?

Mordecai: I'm Mordecai.

Rigby: Rigby.

Prime Minister: Rigby, huh? Well, in honor of your heroism, let it be known from this day forth, rugby shall be renamed Rigby!

Everyone: Huzzah!

Mordecai: Actually, I was the one who threw the life-saving football.

Prime Minister: Well, we're not calling it Mordecai-by. That means going to the bathroom.

(Rigby smiles hilariously at this, then we cut to the sky where an airplane flies by and Mordecai and Rigby are inside the plane.)

Mordecai: Dude, the Australian Prime Minister totally hooked us up!

Rigby: See, I told you it was a good idea to take a nap in that crate.

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooooaaaaaahhhh!!!

(They start to sleep during the flight as the scene fades to black, then it fades back to Mordecai and Rigby once again sleeping in the crate, then they wake up.)

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: This isn't first class!

Mordecai: Wait, do you have that same dream about Australia?

Rigby: Yeah, the aborigine?

Mordecai: The Prime Minister?

Rigby: Me saving the Prime Minister?

Mordecai: Dude, it was a dream, which means we totally got away with taking a nap in a crate!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooooaaaaaahhhh!!!

(They pop out of the crate, but the same kangaroo and its two joeys past by them again, then the camera zooms out as Australian music plays again to reveal they're in Australia for real.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (screaming)

(Episode ends)

(Rigby enters The Coffee Shop and is carrying a big box)

Rigby: Dude! Check it out, man! They're here!

Mordecai: What's here?

Rigby: Our fake band t-Shirts that we ordered from that site last night.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Last night, I asked you if you wanted to be in a band and you said...

(A flashback of the previous night shows Mordecai and Rigby pounding sodas at the computer)

Mordecai: Yes, I wanna be in a band with you. Alright, but we gotta have a cool band name. What do you think of "Cool Dudes"?

Rigby: "Face Punch."

Mordecai: "Rad 'N' Subtract."

Rigby: "Helicopter Crash."

Mordecai: What about "Mustache Cash Stash"?

Rigby: That's it! That's it!

Mordecai: Order the shirts! Order the shirts!

(The flashback ends)

Mordecai: Oh yeah, T-Shirts.

Rigby: Check it out. Bam! (Pulls out a "Mordecai and the Rigbys" t-shirt)

Mordecai: Mordecai and the Rigbys? What happened to Mustache Cash Stash?

Rigby: I changed it. Awesome, right? (Throws a t-shirt at Mordecai)

Mordecai: But that's just our names. We aren't really going to wear these around, are we?

(Rigby puts on the shirt. Mordecai looks at him disapprovingly)

Margaret: Woah, rad shirts! What are those for?

Rigby: They're for our band.

Margaret: You guys are in a band? "Mordecai and the Rigbys"? That's so cool.

Mordecai: No, no, no, we're not in a band, heh...

Margaret: (skeptically) So, what, it's some sort of fake band?

Mordecai: No, it's a real band, but just... not a big deal, you know?

Margaret: (gasps) Your band should play the open mic tomorrow night. (Hands Mordecai and Rigby a flyer)

Mordecai: Yeah, for sure, uh... totally.

Margaret: Awesome. I can't wait to see you guys play. Well, I guess I'll see you then.

Mordecai: Yeah... see you then... then. (Faceplants on the table)

Rigby: What was that, man?

Mordecai: I don't know! I just didn't want her to think we had a stupid fake band!

Rigby: But now we gotta play that open mic tomorrow!

Mordecai: OK, OK, we can totally do this. We just gotta learn one song by tomorrow night.

Rigby: One song?

Mordecai: One song.

(Cuts to the house. Inside the garage, Mordecai and Rigby turn on their amps, and are shown wielding guitars)

Mordecai: Ready?

Rigby: Shreddy.

Mordecai: One, two, three, four!

(They fumble aimlessly at the strings, producing distorted noise)

Mordecai: OK, stop, stop. We need help.

(Cuts to Pops' room, where Pops is playing a beautiful tune on the harpsichord)

Pops: A two-man ensemble? What a charming idea!

Mordecai: How'd you learn to be so good, Pops?

Pops: Ah-ha! (Rises from the harpsichord bench and pulls out some records from inside. The first is 'How to be a Musician' by 'Sir Geoffrey') Throw these records on the old talking machine and you'll be ready for your open mic in no time!

Mordecai: Agh, you know about the open mic night?

Pops: Yes, everybody knows about it. We're all going to be there!

Mordecai and Rigby: Augh!

(Cuts back to the garage. Rigby places the first record on an old-time gramaphone)

Rigby: Wait. If we're gonna learn this in time, then you gotta take this seriously.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Put on the shirt.

Mordecai: Fine. (Puts on his Mordecai and the Rigbys t-shirt) Play the record.

(Rigby winds up the gramaphone and places the needle. A scratchy recording is heard)

Sir Geoffrey: So, you want to become a musician? Bravo! Now, what is the first thing all good musicians require?

Mordecai: Talent?

Sir Geoffrey: Yes! Good personal hygiene is the key to becoming a successful gentleman musician!

Mordecai: (Talks over the record) Augh, this is gonna take like ten years!

Rigby: Yeah, and there's still two more after this one! (Holds up the remaining two records)

Mordecai: There's gotta be a faster way.

Sir Geoffrey: ... all washed up? Good! Now just locate your...

Rigby: All three at once?

(Cuts to Rigby and Mordecai setting three records. Sir Geoffrey talks over himself as they strum badly at their guitars once again)

Sir Geoffrey: (from three speakers)... one, two, three... A minor seventh... Harmonic can be tapped...

Rigby: Dude, this isn't working! I can't understand anything!

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta keep going. Do you wanna look like an idiot at the open mic?

(Mordecai shoves Rigby, who backs into an amp, knocking an opened soda can onto the floor. The soda flows over to power strip on the floor, causing a small electrical fire and plenty of sparks. The power strip explodes, and a bolt of yellow energy flows up through the cables into the gramaphone needles. The gramaphones shoot yellow power through the room and onto the ceiling as Mordecai and Rigby scream. Suddenly the room goes black)

Mordecai: What was that?

(The light re-appears and the room glows yellow, buzzing)

Mordecai: Dude, what's happening?!

Rigby: I don't know!

(The gramaphones levitate into mid air, focus their power into a central ball, spin around, then shoot a focused beam onto the floor. Stylised silhouettes of Mordecai and Rigby appear. The new Mordecai's arm, clad in red, reaches out, and present Mordecai and Rigby's guitars float away towards the new duo)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah!

(The future Mordecai and Rigby launch into superb guitar solos. Future Mordecai has a goatee and shades, and is dressed somewhat like Michael Jackson; future Rigby has shaved most of his tail, is wearing a flannel shirt and shades, skin-tight black pants, brown boots, and has a pencil thin mustache)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooaaah...

Mordecai: Dude, who are you guys?

Future Mordecai: (in British accent) We're Mordecai and Rigby. Who the blazes are you?

Mordecai: Uhh...

Future Mordecai: Hah! Just kiddin'. We know who you are. Coz we're you in ten years!

Future Rigby: (in British accent) You don't know it yet, but this is the moment where we teach you how to rock! (Makes metal sign with right hand)

Mordecai: Dude, this is perfect!

Rigby: Wait, wait. We suck, and if you're us, doesn't that mean you suck too?

Future Mordecai: Didn't you just hear us play?

Future Rigby: Yeah, we're super-successful musicians in the future.

Mordecai: Yeah, look at us, dude! We're wearing sunglasses!

Future Mordecai: Our future's so bright, we gotta wear shades.

Rigby: Awesome! Oh, hey, in the future, do we get that thing we always wanted?

Future Rigby: Oh, we got it. (Pulls up shirt to reveal a biting shark tattoo on his armpit, which bites when he moves his arm)

Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai: Oh, hey, in the future, do I get to go out with Margaret?

Future Mordecai: Huh! (Suggestively) I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise.

Mordecai: Aww.

Future Mordecai: Look. We promise we'll get you ready for tomorrow night's gig if you're willing to put in the work.

Mordecai: Yeah, whatever it takes.

Future Rigby: We said the same thing ten years ago.

Mordecai and Rigby: Awesome!

Future Mordecai: Let's rock!

(A montage shows in which, to the backing of the future Mordecai and Rigby's hit song, they teach the present Mordecai and Rigby all about rock moves and stances. They don't teach them at any time how to actually play an instrument - they practice on brooms and try on new clothes, struggling to walk in their skin-tight pants. The montage ends with future Mordecai and Rigby sitting on the amps applauding their old selves)

Future Mordecai: That's it. You're ready!

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Mordecai: But we never learned how to play!

Rigby: We haven't even picked up a guitar.

Mordecai: Come on, we got the look, we've got the moves down, I know the lyrics backwards and forwards. Just teach us how to play!

Future Mordecai: Woah, woah, woah! Don't worry. You know enough. You're gonna be fine. Besides, it's too late to teach you anything else. Gig's in 20 minutes.

Mordecai: We're screwed.

(Cuts to the coffee shop exterior, where an excited crowd is going inside. In the coffee shop we see Angel playing a solo piece to wild acclaim. Benson, Skips and Pops enter and take seats)

Angel: (sings) ... You're my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you...

Benson: I can't believe they're gonna play tonight. Those two slackers have never even picked up an instrument. This is gonna be a trainwreck.

Pops: Woo, I love trains!

Angel: (sings) ... my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you. (song ends to wild applause. Rigby and Mordecai watch from behind a curtain)

Rigby: Dang!

Mordecai: Yeah. (Mordecai walks backstage, holding his stomach and groaning. Rigby picks up a box)

Rigby: Should I hand out the last of the t-shirts?

Mordecai: You brought the t-shirts?

Rigby: Yeah, for the fans.

Mordecai: Dude, we don't even have any fans. (Grabs the box of t-shirts)

(Margaret enters from through the curtain)

Margaret: Oh, wow! You guys look like rock stars. Hey, can I have one of those?

Mordecai: Uh, yeah... (chuckles nervously) Here's a small.

(Margaret struggles to pull on the shirt. Mordecai watches slack-jawed and drops the box. Margaret eventually manages to get the shirt on)

Margaret: How do I look?

Mordecai: (pause) Amazing.

Margaret: I can hand these out for you guys. Get everyone pumped for the closing act.

Mordecai and Rigby: Closing act?

Margaret: Yeah, save the best for last. Well, break a leg, guys. I can't wait.

Announcer: (from through the curtain) And finally, give it up for Mordecai and the Rigbys! Yeah, come on!

(The Future Mordecai and Rigby enter the dressing room)

Future Mordecai: Sorry we're late.

Mordecai: Where've you guys been?

Future Mordecai: We had to get you these. (holds up glowing guitar picks with a lightning motif)

Mordecai: Picks?! But we still don't even know how to play!

Future Mordecai: Just go out there, you'll be great. Just like we were ten years ago.

Mordecai: But...

Future Mordecai: (shoving Mordecai and Rigby through the curtain) Crowd's waitin'! Go on!

(Mordecai and Rigby appear next to the stage. The crowd, dressed in the t-shirts, cheers for them. They take to the stage under the 'OPEN MIC NIGHT' banner. They put on their guitars and plug them into the amps as Mordecai takes the mic)

Mordecai: Uhh...

(Muscle Man is seen at the back of the crowd, standing on his chair and waving his shirt above his head)

Muscle Man: Come on, ladies, play us a tasty lick!

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other helplessly. Future Rigby motions to Rigby to strum his guitar. Rigby does so and a perfect chord comes out. Mordecai does the same, then they both launch into brilliant lead guitar parts)

Benson: Holy crap!

(Mordecai starts to sing the song)

Mordecai: Your eyes starin' into my eyes, who am I but a guy with two eyes on the prize, and the prize in my eyes is ten times the surprise in your eyes as I kiss you goodnight. / The smile is the fire that lights my soul, gonna remember it until I grow old, cause life's too short, we've gotta do things right, so baby let's just party toni-ight. / Baby, let's just party toni-ight.

(More solos follow, but Mordecai drops his pick. Struggling to lift it up, he hears his guitar part still playing, and his singing part still going, even though he's away from the mic. His guitar, he sees, is plugged into the amp, but the amp isn't plugged into anything.)

Mordecai: (yelling) Rigby!

(Rigby is still rocking out. The crowd cheers as Mordecai waves his arms to stop them.)

Mordecai: No! Augh! (Mordecai sees a CD player at the side of the stage. Future Mordecai and Rigby wave and play air-guitar. Mordecai rushes over and turns off the CD, and the crowd falls silent but for a few calls of "What?")

Rigby: (still playing the unplugged electric guitar, badly) Uhuh! Yeah! Yeah, baby!

Mordecai: You can stop now.

(The crowd boos and heckles)

Mordecai: Wait, wait. I can explain, I can explain! We were lip-synching.

(The crowd boos again. Many throw their t-shirts onto the stage in disgust)

Mordecai: Hey, look, I don't blame you. We thought we could just order some t-shirts and pass ourselves off as a band. But it turns out, playing music's really hard to do. We just got caught up in the dream, man. And just for a little while, it was real. But that's over. And lip-synching's not cool. So we're breaking up the band.

Future Mordecai: (runs onto the stage with Future Rigby) Why'd you stop? It was going great.

Mordecai: You tricked us into lip-synching!

Future Mordecai: Look. We've become rich and famous because of lip-synching. Don't you wanna be a part of that?

Mordecai: (angry) No, that's lame! You may be me, but that's not the me I wanna be.

Rigby: Me neither!

Mordecai: Mordecai and the Rigbys is over. (The two take off their t-shirts. Future Mordecai and Future Rigby begin to fade from view)

Future Mordecai and Future Rigby: Woah, woah!

Future Mordecai: OK, dude. Think about what you're doing.

Future Rigby: Yeah, stop, man!

Future Mordecai: If you break up the band, what are we gonna do in the future?

Mordecai: I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise. (Mordecai starts to rip his t-shirt)

Future Mordecai and Future Rigby: Nooo!

(The t-shirt rips in two. Future Mordecai and Future Rigby explode in a ball of white light, dazzling the crowd. After a moment of shocked silence, Benson rises to his feet and claps. Slowly the rest of the crowd joins in)

Benson: Yeah-heah! Alright!

(The crowd cheers more)

Rigby: I don't know why you thought this open mic would be embarrassing. This is awesome!

Margaret: (waving through the crowd) Mordecai! Mordecai!

Mordecai: (waving back and fighting through) Margaret! Margaret! Margaret!

Margaret: Mordecai!

Mordecai: Margaret!

Margaret: That was pretty cool, what you said up there.

Mordecai: Thanks, Margaret.

Margaret: Oh, hey, have you met my new boyfriend, Angel?

(Mordecai looks stunned)

Angel: C'mon, baby. We don't wanna be late for our (sings) dinner reserva-ations.

Margaret: Oh, yeah. See you, guys! Oh, Angel, you have such a great voice.

(Mordecai and Rigby stand alone)

Rigby: (pause) Maybe you should have just kept lip-synching.

(The episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby drinking coffee on the house's steps)

Mordecai: Alright, let's get back to work.

Rigby: Whoa, whoa, whoa! We should go get a coffee first.

Mordecai: What? We just had a coffee.

Rigby: Well, now hang on. Hear me out. We'll go to the coffee shop, get another coffee and a jelly donut...!

Mordecai: (annoyed) No, dude, we gotta stay here and get back to work.

Rigby: "No, dude, we gotta stay here and get back to work." Listen to you, man. I'm gonna start calling you Benson Junior.

(Benson overhears Rigby as he turns on a faucet, and turns his head)

Mordecai: Dude, Benson can't stand it when you leave jobs before they're even finished.

Rigby: Oh, please. (Benson pops his head into view) What's he gonna do?

Mordecai: Dude, stop.

Rigby: (waving hands) Fire me?

Mordecai: (through teeth) It's Benson!

Rigby: Yeah, I know it's Benson. That's how it works around here. I don't do my work, and he doesn't do a thing about it. It's a win-win.

Benson: (walks in from behind the staircase to Rigby, angrily) Actually, it's a lose-lose, CAUSE YOU'RE FIRED!

Rigby: Whoa, Benson! I was just messing around. Sorry about that. I'm just gonna go back to work now, okay? (He starts running up the stairs)

Benson: No, you're not! You're actually fired. (points back) I want you out of here.

Rigby: I'm sorry, Benson. It won't happen again!

Mordecai: Can't you just give him another chance?

(Pops walks in, pulling a wagon with a flower pot)

Pops: What's going on here?

Mordecai: Benson just fired Rigby.

Pops: Why, what's the matter, Benson?

Benson: (points at Rigby, agitated) Well, for one, he never finishes his work.

Rigby: That's not true. I always finish my work.

(mini-montage of Rigby slacking off: First, he's playing video games as a vacuum cleaner runs behind him. Then, he's playing on the spring set as his sack and trashstick lay in the background. And finally, he stands asleep as he holds a running hose as we can back in the present)

Rigby: Okay. So, maybe I don't always finish my work, but, you never told me how to! How am I suppose to do something I don't even know how to do?

Benson: I don't know. If you haven't figured it out already, you're not gonna figure it out anytime soon! I want you outta here!

Pops: Benson, Benson, calm down. Now I can see why you're distraught, but perhaps you can grant him one more chance?

Benson: No way. I've already given him too many.

Pops: But, he does have a point. He's never been properly trained.

Rigby: Yeah, I do have a good point! A really good point! Isn't there some kind of training thing or something like Pops is saying that I can do?

Benson: You mean like a mentorship program?

Rigby: Yeah, a mentorship program. Exactly! That's what I need to get my life back on track.

Pops: Ah, yes, a mentor. That sounds like a wonderful idea.

Benson: Oh. (turns to Rigby) So you want a mentorship program? (zoom in closer to his head) Well, I'll give you a mentorship program.

(Shortly later, Benson calls Muscle Man through a walkie-talkie )

Benson: Muscle Man, this is Benson. Are you there? Over.

Muscle Man: (over walkie-talkie) Talk to me. Over.

Benson: Muscle Man... (looks off) ...do you still have that mentoring harness?

(clock transition to some time later. Skips tightens the mentoring harness onto Muscle Man, then, he plugs Rigby, wearing a straightjacket, into the front plug of the mentoring harness)

Muscle Man: Hey, everybody, look! (shaking Rigby) It's Rig-Baby!

Rigby: Quit it! (slaps Muscle Man's hands off of him)

Benson: Alright, Rigby. Here's how this mentorship is going to go down. You have to remain attached to Muscle man for an entire eight-hour shift so he can show you how to do your job. If at any time you don't think you can handle it... (points out ripcord on the front of the straightjacket) ...you can just pull that ripcord and walk away.

Muscle Man: Yeah! Walk away right back to livin' in yo mama's basement, where you can quit all you want! (laughs)

(Benson watches his wristwatch go to 8:59:59 to 9:00, and then it beeps)

Benson: The clock is ticking, boys, you better get moving. (walks away)

Muscle Man: You're gonna be the best employee in the park by the time I'm through with you. (zoom closer into head) Because we're about to work real hard.

(Clock transition to a certain part of the park with Muscle man and Rigby about to go to work)

Muscle Man: Alright, time for lesson 1. Lesson 1 is always stay calm.

(Muscle Man brings Rigby down to the fertilizer. Rigby groans in disgust)

Rigby: Aren't you gonna close the bag?

Muscle Man: Save all questions till the end of the lesson.

Rigby: Agh! (whining) But it reeks!

Muscle Man: I don't care if it reeks! Just stay calm and you'll get through it. Unless you wanna quit, cause that's how it sounds right now!  (Puts hand on ripcord) 

Rigby: Wait! No, no! Don't!

(Benson, who is driving the cart, checks on Muscle Man and Rigby's progress)

Benson: Is everything alright here?

Muscle Man: He asked you a question, Rig-baby. You answer to your boss when he speaks to you.

Rigby: (nervous and sweating) Fine! Everything's fine!

Benson: If he steps out of line, don't hesitate to pull that thing.

Muscle Man: You ain't gotta tell me twice. (talks to Rigby) Now pick up that bag of fertilizer, Rig-baby!

(Rigby exclaims as Muscle Man picks up another bag)

Benson: Just sit back and watch a pro. This guy's better at mentoring than anyone I've ever seen.

Pops: I never knew Muscle man was such an expert! Benson, that was so good of you to give Rigby another chance.

(You can see Pops' reflection on Benson's sunglasses) 

Benson: Yep, that's exactly the kind of guy I am.

(Clock transition to the house)

Muscle Man: Lesson 2 is stay cool. If you overheat, you might not finish your job.

(Lifts Rigby up towards the direction of the sun) 

Rigby: Ugh! Come on, man!

Muscle Man: Gotta keep my baby soft skin soft for my lady. But you wouldn't know nothing about that, would you, Rig-baby?

Rigby: Let me down! It's too hot! Let me down!! (hits Muscle Man on the head with his elbow)

Muscle Man: Oh, I'll let you down alright.

(Muscle Man threatens Rigby by trying to pull the ripcord)

Rigby: Wait, I'm sorry... (Weakens the grip of Muscle man's arm on the ripcord)

Muscle Man: One more of those and you're out of here.

Rigby: (Pants 2 times) Benson, what time is it?

Benson: It's 11:43.

Mordecai: Benson, You can't do this to people!

Benson: You better shut up or I'll give you a mentor.

Rigby: (groans)

(Clock transition to a different part of the park where Muscle man is teaching Rigby lesson 3)

Muscle Man: Rig-baby, repeat lessons 1 and 2.

Rigby: Lesson 1, stay calm. Lesson 2, is be cool.

Muscle Man: (correcting Rigby) Stay cool.

Rigby: Yeah, stay cool.

Muscle Man: Alright, forget those two lessons.

Rigby: What?!

Muscle Man: Lesson 3 is the only one that matters. Lesson 3 is never quit. You say it.

Rigby: Never quit.

Muscle Man: What?

Rigby: (slightly louder) Never quit!

Muscle Man: I'm sorry, did you say something, Rig-baby?

Rigby: I said never quit!

(Muscle man turns on an automatic grass trimmer to drown out Rigby's voice so he can talk louder)

Muscle Man: I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

Rigby: Never quit!

Muscle Man: You sound like a quiet little quitter!

Rigby: NEVER QUIT!

Muscle Man: I'm gonna yank this chord, just like your mom yanked that pacifier out of your little baby mouth!!

Rigby: NEVER QUIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!

Muscle Man: Well, we'll have to see about that cause we're about to start working real hard.

Rigby: (sighs)

(Clock transition to a music montage of Muscle man and Rigby working like crazy. First, they throw trash bags into the garbage dumpster with Benson checking up on them again. Secondly, They work under a bathroom cabin with a bunch of dirt in order to fix a drain pipe which squirts Rigby with water. The montage ends. Lastly, They walk to the exam Rigby is going to take)

Rigby: Muscle man, I think that was the worst day of my life.

Muscle Man: What do you mean "was"? You still haven't taken your exam yet.

Rigby: Are you serious? The day's almost over.

Muscle Man: Yeah, well your job's gonna be over if you don't take the exam.

Rigby: (sighs)

Muscle Man: The exam is you have to complete one job to prove that you retained all the information from the mentorship program.

Rigby: What's the job?

Muscle Man: Well, you know how I've been carrying you around all day? Your job is to carry me to that water fountain right over there. I'm heck of thirsty.

(Muscle Man leans down towards the ground so Rigby can get ahold of him)

Rigby: Wait...Wait! No! No! OOOOUGH!

Muscle Man: It's not as easy as it looks, is it? Just stay calm and you'll get through it. Just stay cool and you'll finish anything!

(Dramatic music plays while Rigby carries Muscle man towards the fountain. Rigby starts to groan in pain)

Muscle Man: Forget those two lessons! The only thing that matters is that you never quit! What's the matter Rig-baby, given up already? Huh? I knew you were a quitter from the moment I laid eyes on you!

Rigby: (groaning in pain)

Muscle Man: Just say it, Rig-baby! YOU WANNA QUIT, JUST SAY IT!!

Rigby: Nooooo! (falls down, finally enraged) Muscle Man! None of this has to do with mentoring! You're not a mentor! You're just a BIG, FAT, SMELLY, JERK!!

Muscle Man: (hurt and angered) Well, then I guess we're done here. (Gets back up) If you don't appreciate what I'm trying to do for you then you don't deserve this job, quitter.

Rigby: No, don't, I'll get fired!

(Muscle man yanks the ripchord and unplugs Rigby)

Rigby: (slow motion) NOOOOOO! (His legs grab onto Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: What are you doing?! Get off my face! It's over!

Rigby: (vengefully) No way! I've gone through too much!

(The two workers have a power struggle)

Muscle Man: Get off of me, quitter!

Rigby: No! I'll never quit! I am not a quitter!

(Benson arrives again)

Benson: Here we go, baby. If he lets go of Muscle Man, I get to fire him.

Pops: Oh... my...

(Muscle man and Rigby continue their power struggle)

Mordecai: Benson, You've gotta stop this! He's gonna kill him!

Benson: Hm... (he looks at his watch which says 4:59:06) He's still got a minute to go.

(Muscle Man squeals runs like a horse to get Rigby off and breaks through a fence and the park cafe. Muscle Man bashes into propane tanks and blasts into the air along with RIgby. Rigby tries to grab onto Muscle man's pants which is seeming like it is ripping off. They finally land into a lake. Benson, Mordecai, and Pops catch up to the two and watch the fight underwater)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(The two still struggle underwater)

Mordecai: You gotta call it off, Benson!

Benson: Well now hold on.. He's still got 10 seconds..

(Benson's watch shows 4:59:51. 'Rigby is suffocating along with Muscle man. Benson's watch beeps at 5:00)

Mordecai: It's five o'clock! IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK!

(Pops, Mordecai, and Benson are watching the lake with worry. Rigby finally comes out of the water and brings up Muscle Man)

Rigby: Never quit! (puts Muscle Man down) URGGAH!

Mordecai: Muscle man, are you alright?

Rigby: Muscle Man?.....Don't you quit on me! (pounds on Muscle Man chest)

Muscle Man: (groans then spits water out of his mouth and is conscious again) Congrats, Rigby. You passed the mentorship program.

Rigby: (sigh)

Mordecai: Whoo!

Pops: (Does the "my hat is off to you" salute with his hat)

Muscle Man: Yo, Benson...This one's good to go.

(clock transistion to Mordecai bringing Rigby, who is covered by a towel to keep him warm, a coffee)

Mordecai: Dude, Good job.

Rigby: Thanks.

Benson: Rigby, I'm proud of you. Not only did you last the whole day without quitting, but you applied to what you learned from your mentor to keep your job. Welcome back.

Mordecai: Nice!

Mordecai & Rigby: WHOOOOOOOOAAAAAAA!

Pops: (laughs and claps) Oh, congratulations, Rigby! I knew you could do it.

Rigby: Thanks, Pops.

(Benson & Pops walk away while Muscle Man walks towards Mordecai & Rigby)

Muscle Man: Not everybody agrees with my mentorship style. It's even received it's fairness of criticism throughout the years, but you took it like a man, bro. You worked hard out there today Rig......by.

(Muscle Man and Rigby put out their hands and have a handshake)

Rigby: Where are you gonna go, now Muscle man?

Muscle Man: I don't know. Wherever the wind takes me, I guess. Probably find a place to settle down...And get a burger with a large side of onion rings. See you around, Ladies. (walks away into the distance)

Rigby: You wanna get some food or something?

Mordecai: Sure, dude. But you should probably take a shower first. You smell like Muscle Man.

(End of "Muscle Mentor")

Rigby: WHOOO! Done! (reveals bush to be square-shaped) In your face, bush! (to Mordecai) Hmph! Hmph! Looks like you've got a waste to go there, guy!

Mordecai: Not as much as Muscle Man over there. (Muscle Man has a huge heap of a hedge to trim) He barely touched that hedge.

(Muscle Man, obviously sad and depressed, tries to cut off a twig from the hedge, but lets go at the last moment and breaks down, crying)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man, we got work to do, remember? (Muscle Man weeps again)

Rigby: Dude, are you crying?

Muscle Man: No! Crying's for ladies, like you! I don't cry!

(Cut to Muscle Man's shower. He is sitting there, crying and naked. Mordecai and Rigby are knocking on his trailer, to no response)

Rigby: Dude, he's been in there for hours.

Mordecai: Muscle Man. Muscle Man! Muscle Man, are you taking a shower so we can't see you crying?

Muscle Man: No! It's... it's just the sound of the water hitting the drain!

Mordecai: Dude, what's wrong with him?

(Hi Five Ghost approaches the trailer)

Hi Five Ghost: His girlfriend, Starla dumped him last night.

Rigby: (surprised) What? Muscle Man had a girlfriend? I wonder who had more junk in the trunk.

Mordecai: Muscle Man, just come out. We can talk about it if you want.

Muscle Man: No! I don't talk about my feelings with anyone! Leave me alone!

Rigby: No use, man. Let's let Benson deal with him.

(Cuts to outside Skips' garage. Benson is talking to Mordecai and Rigby)

Benson: So it's come to my attention that Muscle Man's been dumped. And he can't do his job because, I don't know, he's sad or something. So guess what? You two clowns are gonna pick up his work for today!

Mordecai: Aw, what? I'm always sad.

Rigby: I'm sad right now.

Mordecai: Can we get time off too?

Benson: File a request with human resources.

Rigby: OK, who's the HR guy?

Benson: Me.

Mordecai: So... can we?

Benson: No. OK, let's see what we got here...

(A montage scene begins with fast-paced music)

Benson: Task Number One: Dig out the rotting stumps from the picnic area. Watch out for hornets' nests. (Mordecai and Rigby are wrenching out a stump when a nest of hornets attacks them) Task Number Two: that guy who thinks he's a knight is back. (Brandishing shovels, Mordecai and Rigby are avoiding trash thrown by the knight) He's built a castle out of old mattresses at the creek. Get him out of there! And finally, there's the daily maintenance of the park rock garden. (Mordecai and Rigby are standing on tiny stumps in a manicured sand box, sweeping it carefully.)

Rigby: Augh! This is impossible!

Mordecai: Who knew Muscle Man was responsible for so much stuff? We gotta convince him to start working again.

Rigby: Yeah! Why should we do his work?

Mordecai: Alright, let's do it.

(Mordecai and Rigby jump off the stumps and walk off the sand)

Rigby: I won't miss this job. Raking that sand took...

(They look back and see their hard work ruined by their footprints)

Mordecai and Rigby: Nooooo!

(Cuts to the kitchen in the park house. Muscle Man is at the table eating Muscle Maker 3000 straight out of the jar with a spoon. Mordecai and Rigby enter)

Mordecai: Dude, you gotta snap out of it. Benson is making us do all your work!

Muscle Man: I can't work. I'm busy stuffing my face hole!

Mordecai: Look, I know you're upset, but you gotta move on.

Muscle Man: I'm not upset! I'm... I'm... (Muscle Man breaks down in tears, which soon become high-pitched wails. Mordecai and Rigby watch with eyebrows raised before Mordecai places his wing on Muscle Man's shoulder to comfort him)

Mordecai: Come on, dude. There's plenty of fish in the sea. (Muscle Man gets up and follows them from the room)

(Cuts to the grocery store)

Mordecai: Alright, Muscle Man. Grocery stores have tons of available women.

Muscle Man: I don't know, Mordecai. None of these ladies are as hot as Starla.

Mordecai: Dude, man up! Check this out: that girl is single. (A pretty young woman is pushing a shopping cart nearby)

Muscle Man: How can you tell?

Mordecai: Check out her cart. American cheese singles, a single serving of soup, and who buys one banana? And I don't see a ring on that finger. So what are you waiting for? Go get her!

Muscle Man: (Approaching the young woman) Uh, hey, you're a chick. I was wondering if you wanted to... I can't do this! (Muscle Man rips open his shirt to reveal a STARLA tattoo across his chest) This heart beats for another! (Muscle Man falls to the floor and sobs) Starlaaaaa!

(Cuts back to Muscle Man sitting naked in the shower, crying, as Mordecai and Rigby knock on his trailer door)

Mordecai: Muscle Man. Muscle Man!

Rigby: He's never going to come out. There's no way we can help him.

(Hi Five Ghost appears at Mordecai and Rigby's side)

Hi Five Ghost: There is one way. We gotta get him back together with Starla.

(Cuts to the mall. Mordecai, Rigby, and Hi Five Ghost are outside Icy Hot Jewelry & Apparel)

Mordecai: You sure this is where she works?

(Hi Five Ghost nods and they go inside. The store is filled with girls' t-shirts, earrings, and other accessories)

Rigby: Ugh! Everything is all glittery and girl- oof!

(Not watching where he's going, Rigby walks straight into Starla's boobs and screams in horror)

Starla: Can I help you gentlemen?

Mordecai: Uh, do you know a guy by the name of Muscle Man? Big guy, 'bout your build?

Starla: Yeah, I know him. I dumped that loser.

Mordecai: Yeah, well, he's pretty miserable without you. You should give him another chance.

Starla: Hah! I'm not getting back together with him. That's over now.

(She walks away, but Mordecai looks determined and follows)

Mordecai: Look, I know how Muscle Man can be. He's annoying, he smells, and he pretty much has no common decency for others, but he's still human, and he has feelings. We all do. (Inspirational music starts) We're just fragile beings looking for someone to share something with. To laugh with. To love.

(Starla looks mesmerized and sees Mordecai, looking extra-handsome, in a field of stars, ignoring what he's saying, until...)

Mordecai: ... and that's why I think you should get back together with Muscle Man. Well, I guess we'll be going.

(The trio start to leave, but Starla chases and grabs Mordecai's hand)

Starla: Wait! You. You had such a way with words. Muscle Man never talked to me that way. He didn't like talking about his feelings. But you? You're different.

(Mordecai struggles to release his hand)

Mordecai: Oh... Will you excuse us for a minute?

(The trio go outside the store)

Mordecai: Aw, sick!

Rigby: Ohhhhh! She liked you, she liked you!

Mordecai: Dude, shut up!

Rigby: Dude, you should totally go out with her!

Mordecai: What? Are you serious? I'd rather do Muscle Man's work than date her.

Rigby: Dude, if you just play along with it, you can dump her. Then, she'll go running back to Muscle Man for sure.

Mordecai: Augh! Alright, one date.

(Starla rubs her face and body on the store window, much to Mordecai's disgust)

Rigby: Better make it three or four just to make sure the dumping takes full effect.

Mordecai: Augh! Fine.

(Mordecai goes back inside)

Mordecai: Uh, do you wanna, um, you know, eugh, go...out?

Starla: (throws herself at Mordecai) Yes!

(A montage begins: 1. Starla and Mordecai enjoy tacos from the Taco'Clock truck, Starla gets taco all over her face then accidentally spits it at Mordecai. 2. Mordecai and Rigby are working at the snack bar as Starla bicycles past and blows a kiss, which Mordecai ducks to avoid. 3. Mordecai and Starla attend a baseball game, and as Mordecai tries not to be seen, Starla munches on a turkey leg, before the two of them appear on 'kiss-o-vision on the Jumbotron. Starla tried to kiss Mordecai as he fights her off. 4. At the beach, Starla asks Mordecai to rub lotion on her back and rolls over onto her front. Mordecai sees three names on her back tattooed but scored out: Muscle Man, Steve, and Muscle Man. A fourth name isn't scored out: Mordecai. He runs away and the montage ends)

(Cuts to the Coffee Shop) 

Rigby: Dude, did you dump her yet?

Mordecai: No.

Rigby: Come on, man! Get it over with! I don't wanna do Muscle Man's work anymore. I'm exhausted!
Mordecai: I know, I know. I'll dump her.

(Cuts to inside the coffee shop. Mordecai and Starla are eating pie. Starla has a dreamy look in her eyes while Mordecai looks disgusted. Starla licks her lips suggestively, causing Mordecai to choke slightly and drop his fork)

Mordecai: Look, we gotta talk.

Starla: (gasp) You got some pie on your lip. I'll get it off!

(Starla dives across the table and kisses Mordecai in the beak)

Mordecai: Augh, get off of me! (Mordecai pushes Starla away)

Starla: What's wrong, dumplin'?

Mordecai: I'll tell you what's wrong. I don't like you. ("like you" echoes four times) I don't think we should see each other anymore.

(Mordecai gets up and walks out, while Starla sinks onto her stool, depressed)

(Cuts to outside)

Rigby: Dumped?

Mordecai: Dumped.

Rigby: How'd she take it?

Mordecai: Mmm, she took it well.

(A table launches through the glass window of the coffee shop, sending Mordecai and Rigby scattering. An explosion soon follows, and from the wreckage comes a huge, monster version of Starla with bloodshot eyes. It lets out a blood-curdling roar)

Mordecai and Rigby: (screams)

(Mordecai and Rigby run to the golf cart. Mordecai tries to get it to start)

Mordecai: Come on! Come on, come on!

(Starla catches up to the cart and grabs onto the back of it just as Mordecai gets the ignition started)

Rigby: Go! Go!

(The cart weaves down the street as Starla tries to climb to the front)

Mordecai: Hold on!

(Mordecai makes a quick turn and Starla is thrown back onto the road)

Rigby: Yeah, we did it! She just got tr-rashed!

(Starla appears in the side mirror, catching up quickly on foot)

Rigby: Oh no! Go faster! Let's go faster! Step on it!

(Starla barges the cart repeatedly but loses pace as they all enter the park. Here Starla grows to several times her usual height and stamps on the ground, causing ruptures to appear. The cart tumbles down into a pit of lava, with Mordecai and Rigby just leaping from it in the nick of time. Starla follows again, punching the ground to cause another earthquake and destroying dozens of trees. She also destroys the mattress fort down by the creek, causing the man who thinks he's a knight to open a portal to another dimension and escape. Meanwhile the chase continues through the park, destroying the fountain, as Mordecai and Rigby take refuge behind the circus tent)

Rigby: Look out!

(A tree, thrown by Starla, nearly hits Mordecai and Rigby, crushing the tent extension building instead as the duo escape. Starla keeps on throwing trees as a helicopter appears)

Channel 6 News Helicopter Reporter: We're live at the park, where reports of a crazed woman on a rampage...

(Starla launches a boulder at the helicopter. The reporter screams as the helicopter catches fire and plummets to the ground, killing him. Meanwhile, Mordecai and Rigby have made it to Muscle Man's trailer, where they pound the door)

Mordecai: Muscle Man! Your ex's gone crazy and she's wrecking up the park!

(Muscle Man is naked in the shower again)

Muscle Man: Huh?!

Mordecai: Dude, you have to talk to her!

(An approaching appears over Mordecai and Rigby's heads as they gasp in horror. It's Starla, dive-bombing the trailer. The duo dive out of the way just in time. Starla chases them on. Muscle Man, wrapped in a towel, emerges from the trailer bathroom to find his home ripped in half.)

Muscle Man: Starla?

(Cuts to the house. Mordecai and Rigby are inside blocking the door as Starla tries to batter the door down with a streetlight post)

Mordecai: I guess this is it.

(The door comes crashing in and Mordecai and Rigby hit the floor. Starla's eyes are glowing red with fury.)

Starla: Mordecai!

(Mordecai moans in fear, but Muscle Man appears through the hole where the door used to be)

Muscle Man: Babe! I can't stand to see you like this. You gotta stop!

(Starla groans angrily in response)

Muscle Man: Oh... I guess I'll just go.

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man! She's right there! Say something to her!

Muscle Man: (nervous mumble) I think you're foxy when you break things.

(Starla groans angrily again)

Mordecai: No! From here. (Mordecai points to his heart)

Muscle Man: (sigh) Starla?

(Starla turns around to face Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: I can understand you're upset. When I look at you, I think of someone I know. Someone who is fragile and vulnerable deep down. Someone who has feelings. That someone is me. Mitch Sorenstein.

Starla: Huh?

Rigby: (chuckles) His name's Mitch?

Muscle Man: I've been so upset since you left me, baby. You're the light of my life. The fire that burns in my heart. The one. Starla. Will you be my Muscle Woman?

Starla: Mitch...? Oh, Mitch!

Muscle Man: Starla!

(Starla and Muscle Man run to each other in slow-motion)

Starla: Miiiiitch!

Muscle Man: Staaaarlaaaa!

(The couple collide into each other in a sea of flab, and we are treated to a close-up of their french kissing.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, sick!

Starla: Aw, Mitch! I've never heard you talk about your feelings before!

Muscle Man: You know who else doesn't like to talk about her feelings? My Mom!

Starla: (laughs) Oh, Mitch! You have the best sense of humor.

(Starla jumps into Muscle Man's arms, and he carries her down the stairs away from the house)

Muscle Man: Aw yeah, baby. You know I love it when you destroy property. (They kiss again)

Mordecai: As much as I wanna vomit right now, those two were made for one another.

Rigby: This was the most disturbing day of my life.

Mordecai: Yeah. Maybe we should have just done Muscle Man's chores.

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby leave the nursery, holding a lemon tree. Rigby ties the tree to the golf cart)

Mordecai: Dude, hurry up! Tie it down, we're gonna be late!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump inside the golf-cart and drive off. A car stops)

Rigby: Go, Go, Go! Take that street! (they make a sharp turn)

Mordecai: We're not gonna make it, we're not gonna make it!

(Meanwhile, Benson and Skips are standing around at the park. Benson checks his watch)

Benson: I knew it. I knew they'd be late.

Mordecai: This is gonna be close.

(Benson and Skips watch over the hill for Mordecai and Rigby, but they're not coming)

Benson: That's it.

(Benson and Skips approach the cart before M&R suddenly come up driving)

Mordecai: (gasps) Dude, we made it! Dude, we made it! (M&R suddenly hit a rock, sending them out of control. They hit a lamppost, which the tree is lodged into. Mordecai tries to get it out, but the leaves fall out. M&R pick up the broken tree anyway and show it to Benson and Skips) Here's the lemon tree you asked us to pick up.

Rigby: Right on time. (Benson watches the sole lemon fall off the tree) I think the guy sold us a lemon, know what I'm sayin'? 

(M&R snicker. Benson turns red, growls at them, upset and angry that they failed their job, and he's about to yell, but quickly calms down)

Benson: No. You know what? I blame myself. I should've known better than to trust you two morons with such a straightforward task. You obviously need supervision.

Mordecai: (confused) Super-what-now?

Benson: (picks up walkie-talkie on the golf cart) Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, get down here. I need you to watch over Mordecai and Rigby.

Muscle Man: (over microphone) We'll be right there.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: No way! (drops the part of the tree he has onto the ground in anger after hearing their names) You can't stick us with Muscle Man and Hi Five. Those guys are turds!

Mordecai: They have the combined intelligence of bread-mold. Come on, Benson. Give us one more chance.

Benson: No more chances. I'm sending you to the nursery to pick up another lemon tree. If you screw up again, I'll have Muscle Man and Hi Five supervise the next job. Then the next job, and the next. (turns red) GET IT?!

Mordecai: Yes. Um, yes, sir.

Benson: I'm sure.

(Benson drives the cart as he and Skips leave)

Rigby: Aw, man!

Mordecai: Ugh, this blows. You know what the worst is?

Rigby: The smell?

Mordecai: No, dude. Those lame "my mom" jokes Muscle Man always tells.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost drive up from over the hill)

Muscle Man: WHOOOOO!!!

Mordecai: Great.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost drive in)

Muscle Man: Well, well, well. Sounds like someone needs some supervision. You know who else needs supervision? MY MOM! Haha, yeah! (Muscle Man & Hi Five Ghost hi five each other) Now get in the back so I can supervise you.

(M&R, MM & Hi Five Ghost are now in the golf cart together. Loud music blares)

Muscle Man: WHOOOOO!!! Oh, yeah. This song rocks. You know who else rocks this hard? MY MOM!

Rigby: I don't know how long I can take this.

Mordecai: I know dude but if we don't pull this off...

Rigby: Aw, sick.

(Muscle Man's crack is seen)

Muscle Man: I love this tasty lick!

Rigby: That's it! I'm jumping!

Mordecai: No, dude. Don't worry. There's the nursery. This will all be over soon. (Cart passes the nursery) Whoa! Dude! (looks back at the nursery) You just passed the nursery!

Muscle Man: Pull your panties out of your butt, bro. I know a shortcut.

Mordecai: But it was right there!

Muscle Man: Who's supervising this mission? ME, that's who! So, shut your word-hole, I'm listening to my jams.

(Cart stops in the middle of a forest)

Mordecai: What? Where are we? Why are we stopping?

Muscle Man: It's lunchtime, (points to taco stand) This place has the best tacos in the city. (chuckles) You know who else has the best tacos in the city?

Rigby: Dude, Benson will blow a fuse if he finds out we were slacking off.

Muscle Man: You know who else would blow a fuse if she found out we were slacking off?

Mordecai: We don't have time for this.

Muscle Man: You know who else doesn't have time for this?

Mordecai and Rigby: UGH!!

Muscle Man: You know who else says "Ugh"? MY MOM! Hyah! (MM & Hi Five Ghost hi five again)

Mordecai: Can we please get lunch after we pick up the tree?

Muscle Man: No can do. Hi Fives has gots to have his tacos. Watch this. (picks up walkie-talkie) Hey, Benson, we're gonna pull over and grab some lunch. That cool?

Benson: (over microphone) Go for it. I know you guys will get it done.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Rigby: Benson is never that cool with us!

Muscle Man: What? Don't you guys check in?

Mordecai: Uh, no.

Muscle Man: You gotta check in. Benson's the boss. He needs to know where you are at all times. WHOOOOO, LET'S EAT!

Rigby: How come you never check in? (Mordecai pushes Rigby away)

Taco Guy: Muscle Man! H.F.G.! (Taco Guy hi fives Hi Five Ghost) I haven't seen you guys in ages. Who are those losers? (M&R stand there)

Muscle Man: Just some chumps I'm supervising. I gotta make sure they're doing it right.

Taco Guy: I feel sorry for you guys.

Muscle Man: You know who I feel sorry for? MY MOM!

Taco Guy, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost: OHHHHH! (Muscle Man shakes the stand)

Rigby: OHHH! (Mordecai punches him) Ow!

(MM, Hi Five Ghost and the Taco Guy laugh)

Taco Guy: Here's a round of tacos for makin' me laugh.

(Taco Guy hi fives Muscle Man)

Mordecai: Aw, what? You actually thought that was funny?

Rigby: I guess Muscle Man is really insulting himself.

(clock transition to the forest, moments later. Muscle Man is drinking a soda)

Mordecai: It's getting late. Shouldn't we be at the nursery by now?

Muscle Man: (Stops drinking his beverage) Relax, Hi Fives is on it. (Hi Five Ghost opens the engine cover) He knows how to hot-wire the cart, to make it go crazy-fast. You know who taught Hi Fives to hot-wire the cart to get away with slacking off at work and not get in trouble with his boss? (pauses) My uncle, John. He's a mechanic.

Rigby: ...That's cool.

Muscle Man: You know who taught him? MY MOM! YES! (MM&Hi Five Ghost hi five each other a third time. M&R look at each other and get on the cart) Let's ride, babies!

(Later, they're all in the cart together as Muscle Man disobeys a railroad sign and jumps right over a moving train)

Mordecai: The road's back there!

Muscle Man: Don't tell me where the road is, baby. (drives into puddle, over a rocky road, runs over traffic cones and jumps the car again)

Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Rigby: WHOOOOO!

(they pass a police car. The cop watches. The golf cart is reflected on his sunglasses. He drives up to the golf cart)

Police Officer: Yo, Muscle Man! You know how to break the law in all the right ways!

Police Officer and Muscle Man: (hi five) WHOOOOO! WHOOOOO!

Mordecai: What was that?

Rigby: This is awesome!

(the cart stops at the nursery)

Muscle Man: We're here. (clock transition to M&R lifting up a lemon tree inside the nursery) What are you doing? You're trying to throw your backs out? You don't lift it like that. That's what Bobby's for. Hey, yo, Bobby! (Bobby appears) Bobby here lifts like a champ. (short silence) Hey Bobby, you know who else lifts like a champ? MY MOM! (Bobby laughs, hi fives Muscle Man and picks up the tree)

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Dude, I think Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are actually kinda cool.

Muscle Man: Lift with the legs, Bobby! The legs! Like my mom!

Bobby: (laughing) You killing me, man!

Mordecai: Yeah, I don't know about that. (cut to the road) Well, I'm glad this is finally over.

Rigby: Come on, it wasn't--

(Mordecai looks back)

Mordecai: Dude! You just passed the park!

Muscle Man: What's the hurry, grandma? We have all day, let's have some fun.

Mordecai: Ugh!

Rigby: Come on, dude, just give him a chance.

(begin a montage set to the song "Nothing But a Good Time" by Poison. It starts at the arcade, where Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Rigby play Giganto-Fist. Muscle Man looks over at Mordecai, and shows him a quarter. He inserts it into the machine, which attracts Mordecai to play. Next is at the movie theater. The slime monster reaches out for the girl in the red dress. The crowd is shown, all wearing 3D glasses. Muscle Man gives Mordecai some popcorn, which he eats. Third up is at a bowling alley. Hi Five Ghost bowls a strike, and the gang all cheers for him. Muscle Man and Mordecai hi five each other several times, followed by one final four-way hi five. The montage ends with Muscle Man driving the golf cart)

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man's pretty cool. All except for those "my mom" jokes. Dude, I'm gonna to say something.

Rigby: No, don't! Don't try to change Muscle Man, it's not cool!

Muscle Man: Hey, guys. I haven't had quality bro time like this in ages. We should do this all the time. I know I mess around a lot, but you guys are the best. (pause) Hey, Mordecai, you know who else messes around a lot? (Mordecai frowns. In slow motion, Muscle Man says it:) MY MOM! (laughs)

(Mordecai, annoyed, by yet another "my mom" joke, finally having enough.)

Mordecai: (angry) Dude, you're saying it wrong.

Rigby: Mordecai!

Muscle Man: (confused) What was that, bro?

Mordecai: Muscle Man, that joke doesn't make any sense. Whenever you say stuff like that, you're making fun of your own mom. (Hi Five Ghost starts freaking out) It should be "your mom", not "my mom".

Muscle Man: (reflects in mirror; confused) What do you mean?

Mordecai: Well, for example, you know who else has a gap in their teeth? YOUR MOM! (A distressed, Hi Five Ghost tries to stop him; only to be ignored by Mordecai) Or, you know who else is prematurely balding? YOUR MOM! Rigby, help me out.

Rigby: (thinks) You know who else finds their clothes in the garbage? YOUR MOM!

Mordecai: You know who else lives in their car? YOUR MOM! (Muscle Man looks around, visibly frustrated, starts fuming)

Rigby: You know who else has fat ankles? YOUR MOM!

Mordecai: You know who else can't tell a--

Muscle Man: (furious) AAAUUUGGGHHH! (brakes) Are you making fun of my mom?! You're making fun of my mom! No one makes fun of my mom!

Muscle Bro (John): (over microphone) Yo, little brother! My ears are ringing! Is someone making fun of our mom?

Muscle Man: Yeah, they are, bro.

Muscle Bro:  (over microphone) Oh no, bro!

Muscle Man: I know, bro!

Muscle Bro: (over microphone) That's it! I'm coming up there! (M&R get scared)

Muscle Man: You ladies are about to wish you were never born! GET OUT OF THE CART! (M&R do so) You're gonna get it! Nobody makes fun of my mom! Nobody! (he huffs and puffs. Then, all of a sudden, the ground splits. A burning truck emerges from the ground. Muscle Bro steps out)

Muscle Bro: Which one of you girls was talking about my mom? (points at Rigby) Was it you, Tiny? (knocks him over and goes to Mordecai) Or you, string-bean? (pushes him, too)

Mordecai: We were just--

Muscle Bro: So it was both of you!

Muscle Man: I think they hurt mom's feelings, bro.

Muscle Bro: You hurt our mom's feelings. (lifts up a picture) Pay her a compliment, tell her she's beautiful. TELL HER!

Mordecai: (shakes in fear and horror) Uh, you're beautiful, Muscle Man's mom.

Muscle Man: Now, kiss the photo and tell her you're sorry. (John holds photo to Mordecai's face)

Mordecai: Sorry. (kisses photo)

Rigby: (kisses photo) Sorry...

Muscle Man: Fire up the grill, bro. (John puts a grill on the ground, lights it ablaze, and Muscle Man comes up to put the photo on the grill. John flips it, and then hands it to Muscle Man) Eat this picture of our mom, or you'll be sorry!

Mordecai: Please, don't make us eat the picture...

Muscle Man and Muscle Bro: EAT IT!

(Muscle Man rips the photo in half, then hands the halves to M&R. Shaken by the wrath of two muscle bros, Rigby bites into his half first, then Mordecai. Muscle Man and John laugh at them)

Muscle Bro: You should have seen the look on your faces!

Muscle Man: We got you good!

Mordecai: What?

Muscle Man: It was all a prank and you chumps fell for it! (they hi five each other and laugh once again. Hi Five Ghost comes out of the bushes to hi five Muscle Man) That's not even a picture of my mom, (M&R put the two halves together) It's a picture of my butt cheek! I just squished it up to look like a woman's face.

Mordecai: (as M&R are disgusted) Aw, sick!

Muscle Man: Are you still hungry? Cause I got multiple prints. That's right. I dabble in photography. (MM & Hi Five Ghost, as well as John, three-way hi five. Clock transition to the park)

Benson: Thanks for picking up this tree. I knew I could trust you two. (to M&R) As for you two, next time I ask you to do something, do it right or I'll have them supervise you again. Got it? (Benson and Skips walk off)

Muscle Man: You know who else is going to have to get supervised again for not doing it right? (He's seen twirling his shirt around while on top of the cart) MY MOM! (Hi Five Ghost starts driving the cart around) WHOOOOO! Later, ladies! (they drive off, leaving M&R incredibly furious)

Mordecai: (annoyed) I really hate Muscle Man.

Rigby: (also annoyed) You know who else really hates Muscle Man?

(Episode ends.)


(Episode begins with the Park blasting through space with everyone murmuring.)

Benson: Quiet, everyone. Muscle Man, status report.

Muscle Man: Okay, okay. We're out of range.

(The dome comes out of warp speed.)

Mordecai: I can't believe what just happened!

Eileen: Sureshot? Rawls? Do you think they're...?

Benson: Let's not think about that now. I'm...I'm sure they're fine.

Rigby: But what's the deal with that Anti-Pops guy? Why is he out to get us?

Skips: Not us, Pops.

Pops: I don't know why'd he be after me. Does he think I owe him money or something?

Skips: Hmm.

Benson: We got our co-ordinates. We should keep going on our mission. Full systems, check.

Muscle Man: Dome integrity at 100 per cent.

Eileen: No damage to engines.

Hi-Five Ghost: Power systems and shields at full capacity.

Benson: Whoa, seriously? We didn't get hit at all?

Eileen: Wait a sec, it looks like there is one place where we sustained damage.

(Cuts to Skips' house, where his bed is dust.)

Skips: My bed. How did this happen?

(Flashback to previous episode, where Sureshot shoots and misses, then the bullet goes ricoctheting all over the space tree until it hits Skips' bed, ending the flashback.)

Muscle Man: I guess we'll never know.

Skips: Bah, I need a new bed.

Benson: You know, I need one too.

Eileen: I never had a bed at the park.

Pops: My bed turned into a computer.

Benson: Ugh! As if it wasn't enough for them to blow up the space tree and chase us halfway into the next sector, most of us don't have a place to sleep! Before we continue our mission, we're gonna get new beds. Eileen, plot a course to the closest bed store!

Eileen: Uh...I'm not 100% sure how to do that.

Benson: Eileen, figure out how to plot a course to the closest bed store!

(Cuts to a giant UMÄK store.)

Mordecai: Whoa! This is the biggest UMÄK I've ever seen!

Rigby: I can't wait to have some of their meatballs.

Benson: (To Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost) Alright, you guys guard the dome and we'll work on.

Muscle Man: Alright, captain Benson, bro!

Random Guy: Maggie? Maggie! Has anybody seen my girlfriend?

Benson: Now stick together. We don't wanna get lost.

(A giant chicken appears.)

Giant Chicken: Howdy, folks!

(The gang screams.)

Giant Chicken: Welcome to UMÄK's intergalactic flagship. Your stores for modern furniture that's not only inexpensive, it's durable, too!

Mordecai and Rigby: (Laugh.) Wooden butt. (Laugh.)

Giant Chicken: And make sure you check out our cafe and have one of our famous meatball subs! Iiit's meat!

Eileen: (Reads a sign with a photo of a meatball sandwich that says "IIIIIT'S MEAT?" on the bottom.) What's the question mark for?

Giant Chicken: Nevermind that, here's a map! (Gives Eileen a map.)

Eileen: (Opens up the map.)

Benson: There. Beds. Sector 1-15-Z. Is that far?

Giant Chicken: Yes! Now you better get movin'!

(Everyone walks away, then a female bounty hunter enters the store reading a catalog, which apparently is on the lookout for Pops. Then, a montage starts with them entering some tubes which resembles the hyperloop. Shows Mordecai and Rigby sliding on a sofa that's a piano, then shows two people trying out a lamp. Shows the gang going through the tubes until they're at the bed section, ending the montage.)

Eileen: Rigby, there's no way I'm buying that bed!

(Shows Rigby riding a matress on a roller coaster.)

Rigby: Oh, come on! It's the thrill you've always wanted on a bed.

(Shows Pops looking at an iron bed.)

Pops: Hmm... I'm not sure about this one.

(The iron bed scans Pops and makes a hole shaped like him, and Pops tries the bed. Cuts to Skips looking at a small bed called "Cot buddy.")

Skips: This one's cheap, I'll take it.

Benson: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't just buy the first bed you see. You gotta sleep on it every night. This is one thing you don't skimp on.

Skips: You know what? You're right.

(Shows another slightly bigger bed that is the same than the Cot buddy which is called "Super cot buddy.")

Skips: I'll take the full.

Benson: (Walks up to an employee.) Uh, excuse me, we're ready to check out.

Employee 1: (Sighs.) Then go to the check out.

Benson: Wha-?

Employee 1: (Gives a card to Benson.) You take the card with your bed's item number down at the warehouse. And that's where you get your beds.

Skips: Where's the warehouse?

Employee 1: So, you know, all the way where you came back in?

Skips: Yeah.

Employee 1: Further than that.

(The gang groans.)

Rigby: Hey! You know what I could use right now? Some meatballs!

(Cuts to UMÄK cafe.)

Pops: It does feel good to rest a bit.

Benson: We shouldn't be in the open this long. This was suppose to be a quick mission. What if there's somebody's after us?

Rigby: Oh, lighten up, Benson.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Eat sandwich.)

Rigby: Ooh, nice.

Mordecai: Really good.

Eileen: (Is about to eat the sandwich but then a live meatball falls off and runs away, making Eileen lose her apetite, so she leaves the sandwich.) Ugh.

Skips: It's only 2 space creds, what did you expect?

Benson: Enough with the meatballs already. Let's get those beds.

(The gang walks away, and then shows the female bounty hunter.)

Bounty hunter: (Sees the gang and eats her sandwich immedeatly.)

Employee 2: Ma'am, you need to bust your tray.

Bounty hunter: Bust this. (Shoots the employee with a gun that freezes the employee.)

Employee 2: C'mon, I don't make the rules.

Bounty hunter: (Chases the gang walking and then hides behind a shower curtain.)

Pops: (Turns around to see what is behind him, but then continues walking.)

Bounty hunter: (Pokes head out to see.)

Pops: I think someone is following us.

Benson: Really?

(Shows a curved chair.)

Eileen: Eh, it's just a really ugly chair.

Benson: Let's keep moving.

Bounty Hunter: Phew.

Random guy from earlier: (To bounty hunter) Hey, have you seen a girl named Maggie around here?

Bounty Hunter: Shhh.

Random guy: You see, I went to the bathroom a couple of months ago and-

Bounty hunter: (Shoots the random guy.)

Random guy: (Screams.)

(The gang gasps.)

Bounty hunter: Pops, you're coming with me!

Pops: What?

Mordecai: Run!

(The gang starts running and the bounty hunter chases them, trying to shoot them. Then, the gang steps onto the tunnel system but the bounty hunter steps in too.)

Bounty Hunter: Ugh!

(The gang arrives at a section with a sign that says "OVERSIZED" where there is very big furniture. Mordecai looks behind him, and shows that the bounty hunter is behind them.)

Mordecai: Man, who buys this stuff?

Benson: Who cares? Come on!

(The gang runs onto a dead end.)

Bounty Hunter: You can't run forever! (Laughs.)

Benson: Ah! A dead end! What are we gonna do?

Bounty Hunter: Oh, man, the bounty I'm gonna collect after catching you guys is gonna be as big as this big furniture.

Eileen: Aah! We're trapped!

Closet behind them: (Opens doors and speaks with an italian accent.) Get in.

Pops: What?

Closet: I said get in.

(The gang enters the closet.)

Closet: Don't worry, you're safe now.

Benson: Who are you? Show yourself!

Closet: I am the wardrobe you're hiding in. (Turns on a light.) My name is Glömb.

Mordecai: What's going on?

Glömb: (Gasps.) I can't believe my drawers! It is you! The chosen one. It is an honor.

Pops: The chosen one? But I'm Pops.

Glömb: (Chuckles.) What an unusual name.

Rigby: Yeah, whatever you say,"gloomb." Who are you, anyways?

Glömb: I am one of the many operative stations throughout the galaxy to protect the chosen one... er... (Clears throat.) Pops.

(Episode begins with the park workers outside)

Benson: Alright, we got a lot of big jobs, so we're gonna work in pairs today. Pops and Skips, spray the paddle boats down by the docks. Mordecai and Rigby, take out the trash by the Snack Bar. Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost, my A-Team, I need you two to work your magic, and remove those old stumps by the playground.

Muscle Man: (upset) Uh, I'd rather work alone today.

(The park workers gasp)

Benson: What?

Muscle Man: You heard me, I want to work alone.

Hi-Five Ghost: Aw, come on, I said I was sorry.

Benson: (slightly irritated) Okay, what's the problem here?

Muscle Man: He uploaded a highly confidential video of me onto the internet.

Hi-Five Ghost: You labeled the files wrong, I got confused!

Muscle Man: It was your camera, bro! Don't lay this on me!

Hi-Five Ghost: Well, I took the video down before it spread, didn't I?

Rigby: Oh, you mean this video? (He plays a video of Muscle Man holding a South of the Line chile relleno with tongs, wearing an apron that says "Kiss The Chef" in the kitchen on his phone)

Hi-Five Ghost (in the video): It's recording.

Muscle Man (in the video): For those of you who didn't believed me, I'm gonna be the first person to successfully fry a South of the Line chile relleno. Okay, here it goes, bro. (He drops the chile relleno into a fryer, but it explodes, burning off his clothes, then he starts squealing and panicking, he first knock down the dishes from the table, then he runs around screaming, knocking down the fryer, then he rolls on the floor until he stops. The park workers laugh)

Skips: Classic Muscle Man.

Rigby: Yeah, this thing has like fifty million hits too!

Pops: It's funny, because all of his clothes burned off!

(The park workers laugh again. Muscle Man stares angrily at Hi-Five Ghost)

Hi-Five Ghost: Look, Muscle Man, I...

Muscle Man: No, don't even say it, bro! The damage is done! I never want to speak to you again.

Hi-Five Ghost: Well, okay, if that's what you want, then I gotta go. Excuse me! (He flies away, distraught)

Benson: Uh, alright. Muscle Man, in that case, you'll be with Mordecai and Rigby. I guess that's it. I'm gonna go and process all of this. (He, Pops and Skips walk away)

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man, Hi-Five Ghost took that pretty bad. Maybe, you should go talk to him.

Muscle Man: Yeah right! I'm glad he feels bad. I'm never speaking to that traitor again.

Mordecai: Come on, dude, that's crazy.

Rigby: Yeah, you guys have been best friends forever.

Muscle Man: Not so, bro.

Mordecai: What? What are you talking about?

Muscle Man: When I first met Hi-Five Ghost, I couldn't stand him.

(Flashback begins at a high school called South Tree High.)

Muscle Man: You see, back in high school, I was the most popular guy for miles.

Male Student 1: Hey it's Muscle Man!

Male Students: Hey Muscle Man!

Female Student 1:  Hey Muscle Man.

(A girl nearly kisses a guy who looks like Muscle Man but notices he isn't Muscle Man)

Female Student 2: Hey! You're not Muscle Man!

(Reggie cleans the gold plaque that says "MUSCLE MAN")

Reggie: Hey Muscle Man! How's it going? Aw what am I saying? You're the most popular guy in school! You're probably doing great!

Muscle Man: You're right Reggie! I am doing great!

(A black car with a plate that says "FIVES" arrives and all the students look at the car. The driver is revealed to be Hi-Five Ghost)

Female Student 3: Your car is really amazing!

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh thanks! It's a stick shift. Well. I'll be seeing ya!

(Students then say bye to Hi-Five Ghost.)

Reggie: Wow! That guy is cool! If you don't watch yourself Muscle Man, you might not be cool anymore! (laughs) It's just a joke Muscle Man. You know how you like Reggie's jokes!

Muscle Man: Yeah. A joke.

(Scene cuts to the classroom)

Teacher: Class, we have a new student joining us today. So, tell us a little bit about yourself.

Hi-Five Ghost: Well, I moved here from Wichita. I like music and uh, my name is Hi-Five Ghost. But my friends call me Fives.

Muscle Man: Well then, guess no one calls you Fives! Get it? Because you have no friends!

Hi-Five Ghost: (Laughs) No. I have tons of friends. But do you want me to be your friend? You seem pretty uncomfortable about not having friends.

(Whole class laughs at Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Yeah, well, you know who else doesn't have any friends? My mom! Hah!

Hi-Five Ghost: (Laughs) That's really funny, but...that's really sad. You should be considerate to your mother. It would probably hurt her feelings if she heard you talking like that.

Male Student: Oooo! New kid schooled you!

Muscle Man: No he didn't!

Teacher: As a third-rate substitute teacher, I have to say, you got schooled Chimichanga packs.

(Whole class laughs at Muscle Man again and scene cuts to the hallway)

Muscle Man: Who does that guy think he is?!

Reggie: I think he said his name was Hi-Five Ghost.

Muscle Man: Uh, I know that Reggie, it was a reportical question.

(Two girls then laughs while talking)

Muscle Man: Hey Reggie, check this out.

Reggie: Oh yeah! Muscle Man! Go knock 'em dead!

(Muscle Man approaches the ladies)

Muscle Man: Hey ladies. You like buns?

Lacey: Yeah.

Muscle Man: Then check out these butt cheeks! (Muscle Man then shakes his butt cheeks up and down)

Hi-Five Ghost: Excuse me! Can one of you guys show me where Room 2-10 is?

Lacey: Oh, I'll show you.

Lacey's friend: Not if I show him first Lacey!

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh, I'm sure both of you agree with directions. Um, could you both show me?

Lacey's friend: We'll get you to Room 2-10.

Muscle Man: Hey! The show's not over! (Muscle Man removes his shirts then)

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh! That's impressive physique. Well, see you later!

Muscle Man: Wait! I need directions too! Oh, it's on bro!

(Cut to the cafeteria. Muscle Man is eating then Fives appears)

Hi-Five Ghost: Hi! Mind if I seat with you?

Muscle Man: Yes, I do.

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh thanks!

(Hi-Five Ghost then sits beside Muscle Man)

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh, I see you like nachos, so do I! What a coincidence!

Muscle Man: Is that so?

(Muscle Man eats his nachos fast and messy)

Muscle Man: Let's see how much you really like them. Reggie!

Reggie: Nacho Eating Contest!

(A montage of them fighting for the contest and Muscle Man is weakening while Fives is still not giving up and Muscle Man finally passes out.)

Student 1: He's gotta be like the coolest dude around!

Student 2 : Let's get the new guy the best parking spot on campus!

(Students then yell "Fives!" repeatedly and moving Muscle Man away and putting Fives' car on Muscle Man's parking spot.)

Muscle Man: Aw man! That was a really convenient spot! Can you believe this Reggie? (Notices Reggie is gone) Reggie? (Sees Regie on Fives' side with the other students) Reggie get over here!

Reggie: Uhh, I think I'm gonna hang out with Fives now.

Muscle Man: What? Reggie how could you do this to me?

Reggie: I'm sorry bro, in life, things gotta change, like going from not-so-cool to very cool. And hanging out with this guy will make me very cool!

Hi-Five Ghost: Uh, Thanks! I'm glad you think so Reggie!

Reggie: Sure man! You're my best friend! Up high, bro!

Muscle Man: That's it! I challenge you to a drag race, new kid! If I win, I get my parking spot back, which means, I'll be the coolest guy on campus! And you might as well move back to Wichichusetts.

Hi-Five Ghost: Wichita.

Muscle Man: Whichever! Tomorrow, after school, at the park, We go "mano e mano". Be there!

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh-uh, sure! If it's a race you want, then it's a race you'll get, I guess.

Reggie: You hear that everybody?! Drag race tomorrow!

(Scene cuts to The Park)

Muscle Man: Huh? (sees Fives' car on his rear-view mirror)

Hi-Five Ghost: I like what you did to your truck! The spoiler's pretty cool!

Muscle Man: Well I hate to spoil the ending, but I'm gonna win this race and things are gonna go back the way they were, the way they should be.

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh-uh, Hassle the prams huh.

Muscle Man: Sorry, what was that?

Hi-Five Ghost: Oh! I said (car engine) I said! (car engine)

(Starla then appears and says)

Starla: Alright! The first one to make it at the end at Devil's Run, is the coolest guy in school! Go!

(The race then commences and they race each other, there is the Devil's Run but Muscle Man wants a shortcut.)

Muscle Man: Time to take a shortcut.

Hi-Five Ghost: Whuh!

(Muscle Man goes through a maintenance road while Fives went through the Devil's Run)

Muscle Man: Time to jump this gorge!

(Muscle Man turns on his nitro and makes the jump but his steering wheel is dislocated.)

Muscle Man: Time to freak out!

(Fives then sees the finish line)

Hi-Five Ghost: Home free!

(Muscle Man then bumps the car of Fives)

Hi-Five Ghost: Whuho!

(Fives' wheels then pops and both cars are going towards the Eagle's Rock.)

Reggie: They're gonna crash in the Eagle's Rock!

Hi-Five Ghost: We gotta bail! On three, One-

Muscle Man: Whoa whoa! Who said you can count?

Hi-Five Ghost: Three!

(They both then bail and hit each other while their cars explode upon hitting the Eagle's Rock and after the explosion, a hole that is now known as the Crash Pit was created. Muscle Man is barely hanging on the Crash Pit.)

Hi-Five Ghost: Muscle Man! Take my hand!

Muscle Man: Why!? I was a complete jerk to you!

Hi-Five Ghost: That doesn't matter now! Just grab on!

(Muscle Man grabs Fives' hand but the piece of boulder that Muscle Man was holding onto breaks and they both fall into the Crash Pit.)

Muscle Man: I'm too heavy! Just let me go! You're too cool to die because of me bro! You've always been cooler than me!

Hi-Five Ghost: What? No way! I always thought you were the coolest. No one's jokes have made me laugh as hard as yours!

Muscle Man: Really? Well, maybe we could have been best friends!

(Muscle Man tries to let go but Fives' hand doesn't then he goes up barely.)

Hi-Five Ghost: No!

(They then successfully made it back at the surface.)

Muscle Man: You, you saved me!, I'm sorry for being such a jerk to you Mile High Cool!

Hi-Five Ghost: It's Hi-Five Ghost, but you can call me Fives.

(They then shake hands)

Hi-Five Ghost: You still want that parking spot?

Muscle Man: Nah, both our cars are destroyed anyway.

(Mr. Maellard and Pops arrive.)

Mr. Maellard: Hey! What did you ruffians do to my park?!

Student: Scatter!

(All of the students, including Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost scattered away)

Mr. Maellard: Get back here! Why you... Hey! Aarrrrggh!! Rotten kids! Pops, promise me you won't let things happen when you are park manager. Pops?

(Mr. Maellard finds that Pops is beside the Crash Pit.)

Pops: (laughs) Look at the penny go, papa! (He drops his penny in the pit)

Mr. Maellard: Ah, I gotta hire somebody else to take care of this place.

Muscle Man: Dude, you wanna come back later to crush stuff into the pit?

Hi-Five Ghost: Okay, I'm cool with that!

Muscle Man: Yes! Woo! Woo woo woo!

(Flashback ends)

Muscle Man: Yeah ever since then Fives and me have been best bros, practically inseparable.

Rigby: So does that mean you're gonna forgive him?

Muscle Man: Forgive him for what? Oh.

(Scene cuts to Fives standing beside of what used to be the Crash Pit and Muscle Man approaches Fives.)

Muscle Man: Remember when this used to be the Crash Pit?

Hi-Five Ghost: Yeah.

Muscle Man: I wish it was still here so I can crash this dumb argument in it.

Hi-Five Ghost: Look, I'm really sorry about the video.

Muscle Man: I shouldn't have overreacted. If anyone should apologize it should be me. Besides, a thousand embarrassing videos could never tear apart our friendship. I'm sorry Hi-Five Cool.

Hi-Five Ghost: Call me Fives.

(Episode Ends)

(The episode starts off with Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Thomas at the Coffee Shop)

Muscle Man: Hey, hear me out. All I'm saying is that it's hard to make a New Year's resolution when you're always bringing your "A" game.

Mordecai: Tch! Come on, you gotta have a resolution for new years.

Muscle Man: Hmm. I guess I can put in more time on my amazing muscles. I'll really get these kittens to purr next year.

Hi Five Ghost: I think I would like to learn a second language. What about you, Thomas?

Thomas: I'm going to try to help my mom more next year.

(Rigby blows raspberries in response)

Muscle Man: Not cool, bro. That resolution is legit.

Eileen: Here are your coffees, guys.

Rigby: Yo Eileen, you got a resolution?

Eileen: Well, I would like to work on my craft blog more, but I won't have time until we get a new waitress around here.

Man: (Off-screen) Can I get a refill?

Eileen: Later.

(Walks off)

Rigby: Ugh! Let's talk about real resolutions. This year is going to be the year of the Rigby. I'm keeping it all Rigby, all the time.

Mordecai: What does that even mean? Your'e just picking something vague so you can't fail at it.

Rigby: No, last year definitely didn't have enough Rigby. This year is gonna be Rigby crazy!

Mordecai: I don't know, last year felt pretty crazy.

Rigby: That's just cause Margaret dumped you.

Mordecai: Aw, dude! Come on!

Rigby: What? I'm just keeping it Rigby.

Muscle Man: So, you gonna turn around your lady luck this year?

Mordecai: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I am. This year, no more waiting to wuss out. If I see a cute girl, I'll just talk to her.

(The gang cheers)

Muscle Man: So, when are we meeting up for the New Year's Eve party?

Thomas: What New Year's Eve party?

Rigby: It's one of those parties where you wear masks and stuff.

Mordecai: A Masquerade?

Rigby: Yeah, whatever. Like I said, you wear masks.

(A door opens up, which reveals a girl with snake hair and her friends. She manages to catch Mordecai's eye.)

Muscle Man: Yo, bro. She's pretty smoking.

Mordecai: Yeah. Uh, I mean what?

Rigby: You should go talk to her, man.

(The gang complains)

Muscle Man: Come on, dude. Come on.

Mordecai: Uh, I don't really think--.

Everyone: Come on, dude!

Rigby: Come on, dude. You got this. No problem.

Mordecai: Yeah. All right. I got this.

(Everyone cheers Mordecai on while he walks up to Tracy. Mordecai talks to her and her friends and they start laughing while the gang tries to hear the conversation.)

Rigby: What are they saying?

Muscle Man: I don't know, bro. Be quiet.

Thomas: She's smiling a lot.

Hi Five Ghost: Shh! Shh! He's coming back. How did it go?

Mordecai: (Sighs) I got her digits!

(The gang cheers)

Thomas: So, are you gonna call her?

Mordecai: Yeah. I think I'll ask her to the New Year's party tomorrow.

Muscle Man: Nice.

Rigby: Looks like we need a round of victory coffees! But first, I need to empty the tank.

(Rigby flushes the toilet and starts washing his hands when a hologram appears that looks just like Rigby)

Future Rigby: R-R-Rigby!

Rigby: Ahh!

Future Rigby: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Chill, dude. It's just me, I mean you. Look, I'm you from the future.

Rigby: What the--? Were you in the stall the whole time?

Future Rigby: Gross! No! I got something to tell you. You have to help Mordecai. He's going to kiss a girl at New Years and you have to stop him.

Rigby: That sounds like the opposite of helping him. Are you really me from the future?

Future Rigby: Come on! You have to trust me!

Rigby: Oh, yeah? Prove it. If you're from the future, then what's my New Year's resolution?

Future Rigby: Year of the Rigby, baby!

Rigby: Whoa! You are me from the future!

Future Rigby: Yeah, I know.

Rigby: Okay, so what's the deal about this New Year's kiss again?

Future Rigby: Okay, so it's going to happen like this. Tomorrow at the New Year's mask party, Pops is going to open a bottle of sparkling apple juice too early, then Muscle Man is going to streak in a diaper, and then right after that, Mordecai is going to kiss a girl he shouldn't kiss. You gotta stop that kiss!

Rigby: Okay, but why?

Future Rigby: Sorry dude, future rules say I can't tell you. But--.

Future phone: Insert five credits to continue the hologramic call.

Future Rigby: Wait! Trust me! It's the only way he'll be happy!

(Future Rigby disappears)

Rigby: Uhhhhh...

(Back at the house, Rigby is having a nightmare about what his future self told him, which shows him running as a lot of clocks spin around until they hit midnight. He then falls onto the cork on the apple juice bottle as Pops is opening it up. It sends him flying, and he sees Muscle Man streaking as he passes by.)

Muscle Man: Happy New Year, bro! Whoo hoo!

(Then Mordecai shows up puckering up for a kiss. Rigby screams, then wakes up. He quickly grabs Tracy's phone number and flushes it down the toilet.)

(In the morning, Mordecai starts looking for Tracy's phone number)

Mordecai: Dude, have you seen that girl's phone number? I thought I put it on the nightstand, but I can't find it.

Rigby: Uh, what did it look like?

Mordecai: Like a bunch a numbers next to a girl's name.

Rigby: Oh, that phone number! Nope, haven't seen it.

(Mordecai looks at Rigby suspiciously)

Mordecai: Rigby, where's the number?

(He takes Rigby's magazine away)

Rigby: Look, you don't need to be mad, but I might have thown it away.

Mordecai: What?! What's wrong with you? Ugh!

Rigby: Hey, just calm down. My future self told me this is the right thing to do.

Mordecai: Oh, yeah; then where's this future self now?

Rigby: Uh, he had to go; he ran out of credits. Future credits.

Mordecai: Not cool, bro.

Rigby: Come on, we'll go to the party with a group like we planned. It'll be fun.

Mordecai: Alright. It's not like I'm going to see that number again, anyway.

(Mordecai's phone suddenly rings, and he answers) 

Mordecai (continued): Hello? Oh, hey, Tracy. Yeah yeah, of course I remember you, from the coffee shop. No, no, I was totally gonna call you; I just didn't know if I had to wait like a day or two or two and a half. But, um, yeah, I was wondering if you wanted to, if you don't have plans, to go to this New Year's masquerade party tonight? With me, I mean. 

(Short pause, and Mordecai silently cheers as Rigby walks out of the room. Mordecai still continues to talk to Tracy.)

Mordecai (continued): Cool. So, should I pick you up?

(Rigby then goes downstairs and sees Muscle Man and High-Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Yo, Rigby; check it out. I'm gonna prank in the New Year right. I'm making these tear-away tuxedo pants, so I can streak at midnight.

(He tears off the pants)

Muscle Man (continued): Fives, time.

Hi Five Ghost: Point forty-five seconds.

Muscle Man: Still not fast enough.

Rigby:  (Makes a disgusted face) You're streaking at the New Year's party? (Gasps) Oh, no!

(Runs off)

Muscle Man: Whatever. Not everyone understands performance art.

(Rigby goes to Skips's house)

Rigby: Skips! I have to stop Mordecai from kissing this girl at midnight.

Skips: Why?

Rigby: Cause my future self appeared to me in the bathroom, and he told me all this stuff that's going to happen, and now it is happening, and all I know is it's really important!

Skips: Hmm. Well, it sounds like the wheels of fate are already in motion, so... you're probably gonna fail.

Rigby: What?! So, what do I do?

Skips: Time traveling gets really complicated, and my advice is to not overthink it. See you at the party.

Rigby: Aghhhhhh!

(At the party, Rigby starts talking to Benson)

Rigby (continued): Benson, have you seen Mordecai?

Benson: Yeah, he came in a while ago with his date. She seems pretty nice, yeah.

Rigby: No! Ahhhh!

(He runs into the party trying to find Mordecai)

Rigby (continued): Mordecai? Pops! Have you seen Mordecai?

Pops: Oh, Rigby; how did you know it was me? (Laughs) Oh, before I forget, make sure you get your sparkling apple juice.

(Rigby gasps as he remembers that Pops was going to open an apple juice bottle at the party)

Rigby: Oh, no! 

(Runs off)

(Scene changes to Mordecai and Tracy)

Tracy: So, you work and live at the park.

Mordecai: Yeah; it's pretty cool. Uh, hey, do you know what this party reminds me of?

Tracy: Uh, what?

Mordecai: Well you know that video game where you're spying that four anemasie, and you have to fight all the zombies?

Tracy: I wasn't allowed to play video games as a kid.

Mordecai: What? You gotta be kidding me. (Laughs) So, what are you into?

Tracy: Texting, some social media.

Mordecai: I'm gonna get us some punch.

(Mordecai leaves while Rigby comes in)

Rigby: Mordecai!

(He hides behind a pole as Tracy is seen talking on the phone)

Tracy: (On the phone) Ugh, this date is the worst. I thought he was eccentric, but he's just weird. The good news is when Tommy finds out I'm with another guy, he'll be so jealous. We're totally getting back together.

Rigby: Aw, future me totally called it.

(Mordecai returns with a cup of punch)

Mordecai: Here's your punch.

Rigby: (Rigby knocks down the punch) Dude, no!

Mordecai: Ugh! Rigby! what are you doing?

Rigby: You can't kiss that girl! She said you were "electric" and weird, and she's just using you to get back with Tommy!

Mordecai: That's it.

(Grabs Rigby)

Rigby: She's the wrong girl! You have to listen to me!

Mordecai: No, dude. will you quit messing with me? I think I have a chance at this.

Rigby: Aghhh! You can't do this! My future self told me this is important!

Mordecai: Oh, the future self you met in the bathroom? Right.

Rigby: No! (Grabs onto Mordecai's leg) Don't kiss her!

Mordecai: Get off of me!

(Mordecai shakes Rigby off of his leg, but Rigby tries to stop him. He finally ends up pushing Rigby into the bathroom.)

Rigby: No! Wait!

(Mordecai closes the bathroom door and shoves a chair under the knob so Rigby can't get out.)

Mordecai: I hope you enjoy spending the year of the Rigby alone.

(Rigby randomly pounds on the door and his future self appears)

Future Rigby: R-R-Rigby!

Rigby: Dude, why are you always showing up in the bathroom?

Future Rigby: (Shrugs) I just get better reception. Anyway, what are you doing in here? You're running out of time.

Rigby: Me? What are you doing in here? I could've used you out there when I was trying to convince Mordecai. He wouldn't believe me, and now it's almost midnight!

Future Rigby: Alright, alright, here's something to help you.

(Future Rigby sends his past self a stopwatch)

Future Rigby (continued): This stopwatch will slow down time for about sixty seconds. It will buy you some time to stop the kiss.

Rigby: Great, but how am I supposed to get outta here in time to use it?

(His future self points up to an air vent)

DJ: Alright, everybody, the ball is dropping on my watch, which means it's time to countdown for the New Year.

Rigby: (Rigby climbs up to the air vent) Uh, I guess I'll see you later?

Future Rigby: Not unless you screw up something royal.

(Future Rigby teleports away and Rigby gets inside the vent. He tries to find an exit while everyone is counting down to the New Year. Rigby finds the exit unsuspectingly and falls down. He then sees Mordecai and Tracy about to kiss and he uses the stopwatch, which slows down everything except for Rigby himself. Muscle Man is shown tearing up his clothes while in a diaper. Rigby starts running over to Mordecai and Tracy, but accidentally bumps into Pops, which makes him open his sparkling apple juice early. The juice gets on Benson and Skips, and the cork bounces and hits Muscle Man's eye, which makes him go on a rampage. Mordecai and Tracy are shown about to kiss once again.)

Rigby: Nooooooo! Huh?

(Rigby notices some people that Muscle Man knocked down are blocking his path and jumps on one of them and shoves "Mordecai" away from the kiss. The stopwatch breaks into pieces, and the time goes back to normal.)

DJ: Happy New Year!

(Everyone cheers and balloons fall down)

Rigby: Did I make it?

Tommy: (Who has Mordecai's hairstyle and color, and is wearing a mask that represents Mordecai's face) Get off me, punk!

Rigby: Huh?

Tracy: Oh, Tommy; are you okay?

Tommy: Tracy Hashtag, you're the best.

(Tracy and Tommy start kissing)

Rigby: Wait, what?

Mordecai: Hey.

Rigby: Mordecai!

Mordecai: So I figured out who Tommy was. You were right, dude. I should've listened to you. Sorry for locking you in the bathroom.

Rigby: So that means--? You didn't--? I did it! Whoo! Year of the Rigby!

Mordecai: (Bumps into a girl whose head represents a cloud) Oh, uh sorry.

CJ: No worries. Running to meet your date? I get it.

Mordecai: Actually, the date thing didn't plan out tonight.

CJ: Oh, I know how that goes.

(Mordecai and the girl laugh as they notice everyone kissing their dates)

CJ (continued): You know, while the clock isn't over yet, we can still make the best of this.

Mordecai: Huh?

(The girl kisses Mordecai. There is a short pause, and they kiss again.)

DJ: And let's greet the New Year with a fresh face. Everyone, take off your mask!

(Mordecai and the girl stop kissing to take off their masks. When the girl takes off her mask, Mordecai finds out that the girl is CJ; who he hasn't seen since "Yes Dude Yes")

(The both of each other both say each other's names)

Mordecai: CJ?

CJ: Mordecai?

Mordecai: Uh...?

Rigby: Aw, what?! So, does that mean--? Did I--? I gotta check the bathroom.

(Runs off)

Mordecai: CJ?

(Mordecai notices she's gone and we see her exiting the party. Mordecai sees her mask and picks it up, worrying about what's going to happen now. Then we see Muscle Man still streaking while being chased by cops.)

Muscle Man: Whooo! Happy New Year! Whoo hoo!

(Mordecai and Rigby are inside their room, Benson is lecturing them)

Mordecai: Come on, Benson!

Benson: Your room's a biohazard and quite possibly radioactive.

(He uses a radioactivity meter)

Benson: Nobody's leaving until you two clean this room! Don't even think about sneaking out!

(Benson storms out of the room and slams the door)

Rigby: Dude, but that concert is in 20 minutes!

Mordecai: There's only one way we're gonna sneak out quiet enough to get past Benson.

(Scene cuts to the living room where Benson is watching TV)

Man on TV: We now return to our feature presentation of "Master of the Flying Sword vs The Two Armed Puncher."

Benson: Oh yeah, very realistic.

(Scene cuts to upstairs where Mordecai and Rigby are wearing ninja costumes)

Mordecai: (whispering) Don't make a sound.

(With that being said, the duo stealthily swoosh halfway downstairs to check on Benson, then swoosh back up where they were. They tiptoe down the stairs as Mordecai swooshes his head around to check on Benson again)

Benson: Huh?

(Thinking that he's been compromised, Mordecai swiftly hides his face behind a portrait of Pops as Rigby slides on the rail silently with a cartwheel. He then hides behind the rail and lunges away as Mordecai follows, all the while doing backflips with more swooshing. They head for the door until Rigby stops Mordecai)

Rigby: Psst! Wait a sec.

(Rigby runs back towards Benson)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(Rigby stands behind the couch and throws some punches and chops in thin air while Benson's not looking. Mordecai snickers and runs behind the couch with Rigby before they start reenacting the TV program and mouthing out the lines)

Master of the Flying Sword: I will kill every two-armed man I come across!

Two Armed Puncher: Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha! Ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Your life will end on this, Two Armed Man.

Master of the Flying Sword: Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha! Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha! Ha-ha! Ha! We fight now!

(Mordecai and Rigby reenact the fight scene)

Two Armed Puncher: Thousand Flaming Fist Technique!

(The fake fight goes on for about five seconds and they stop)

Master of the Flying Sword: You are truly - (coughs) - the Two Armed Puncher. (groans)

(Mordecai gives the signal to leave and they were about to go out the door, until...)

Benson: If your room isn't clean, you're fired.

Rigby: How'd you know we were here?!

(Benson points at the TV)

Benson: Your reflection in the TV.

(Mordecai and Rigby see themselves in the TV's reflection)

Benson:...and all that loud swooshing.

(The duo groan before they look at each other and pull out smoke bombs)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ninja Vanish!

(They throw the smoke bombs to the floor, activating them, and making Benson cough)

Benson: Mordecai and Rigby!!

(The episode starts off with scenes of "1000th Chopper Flight Party" being shown. CJ, in storm cloud form, eats Margaret. Margaret then wakes up from her dream. She takes a deep breath, coughs then takes out her retainer and puts it back in its case. She then rests her head on her pillow. A moment later, there's a soft knocking at her bedroom door. She sits up again.)

Margaret: (uncertainly) Come in...

Eileen: (opens the door a crack) Uh...Margaret? CJ's at the door.

Margaret: CJ's HERE?!..(looks around)...At this apartment.

Eileen: (fastly) She's at the door to this apartment, yes. (Scene then cuts to CJ at the front door talking to herself)

CJ: *sigh* Alright CJ you've got this. (Sees Margaret) Margaret! (Margaret is shown walking to the door, still in her PJs) Hey! I haven't seen you since I ruined your dad's party, heh heh (Margaret's face is shown, clearly upset and nervous. CJ notices this).....Ok, bad joke. (Scene shows the two of the again) Look I just need to say...(Scene shows CJ)....I'm really sorry about before.....And before that........And-and before that. Pretty much the whole time I've known you....But...how well do I know you? Let's go on a double date!

Margaret: (Scene shows Margaret's shocked face) Double date?!

CJ: Yeah! So we can get to know each other. Me and Mordecai, you and your boyfriend. Double date!

Margaret: (looks to the side and speaks slowly, still uncertain) Oooooookaaayy. I mean, are you sure that's ok?

CJ: Uhh (thinks, then smiles) ...We should make it ok. (Walks up to Margaret) Its important to me that we're all...(gestures her hands to Margaret then herself, smiling)

Margaret: Heh, alright cool.

CJ: (speaks fast) Cool! Great! It'll be great! You're great, (points to Margaret) ok? Ok.

Margaret: (nods, understandingly)

CJ: (gives two thumbs up) Ok! Side Line at seven! (leaves)

Margaret: See ya then! (Closes the door and leans against it) *sigh*.....(brings a wing to her face) *groans* (puts both wings covering her face) Eileeen! (Flops on the couch, her face hitting a pillow) (muffled) EILEEEEEEEEEN!

Eileen: (puts a hand on Margaret's head) (comfortingly) I heard your muffled screams. What's the matter?

Margaret: (her face is out of the pillow, but still laying down, distraught) I made it all up. I don't have a boyfriend.

Eileen: (eating an egg on bread) So you're not dating weekend sports anchor Del Hanlon (bites)

Margaret: (still distraught) No. But saying I did felt like the only way to....um...(looks at Eileen) not die?

Eileen: Ok. Well why did you agree to that double date thing?

Margaret: (gets up and is now sitting on the couch, still distraught) I don't know! CJ was really excited about it, so I just, went along with it? This is really bad. If they find out I lied, it'll make everybody feel all weird again, what should I do?

Eileen: (fast) Tell the truth.

Margaret: But then, they'll know, I lied!

Eileen: (slowly) Ok, well, that was kind of the only sensible option. You could...(thinks)...ask Del Hanlon to pose as your boyfriend?

(Scene changes to a playground where middle school kids are playing tetherball. Del is scene in front of a camera, reporting about a tournament)

Del: Tetherballs screen through the air as do the dueling egos of these athletic titans. This has been regional junior high tetherball, I'm Del Hanlon, bidding you adieu. (Bows at the camera)

Cameraman: And cut!

Del: Aaah, (straightens tie as he walks over to the refreshments) you've done it again Del. Aaah. (Notices Margaret waving and Eileen) Well, hey, Margaret, Eileen, what brings you here? Most people just see tetherball as a more boring version of "ball in a cup".

Eileen: I do feel that way about tetherball. But actually, Margaret has a favor to ask.

Margaret: (nervously and slowly) Yeeeaaaahh. Could yooooouuuu....(fast)...hand me that water bottle?

Del: (Grabs one and gives it to Margaret) Hey, you got it!

Margaret: Thanks! Well, (fast) that's all I needed see ya Monday!

Eileen: (Stops Margaret from leaving) Margaret accidentally called you her boyfriend (Margaret slaps her face, blushing) Could you pretend to be her date tonight?

Del: *gasps* eeeeeeeeeeh...uuuugghh. (Shows Margaret's worried face) Yes! I have always wanted to be an actooooor! 

Margaret: *sigh of relief* Wow, thanks! (Looks at Eileen) Sooo, how do we know what to say?

Eileen: Let's test it out. (Margaret goes to stand by Del) So, where'd you guys meet? (They answer at the same time)

Del: Air.

Margaret: Water. (They look at each other, they back at Eileen) Ugh, I'm really bad at lieing. I don't know what to do at all.

Eileen: (Nods) I know who can help.

(Scene changes to "The Non-Descript Coffee Shop", where they are meeting Rigby. They are sitting at a table. Rigby sits out of the light, giving a detective feel. The others sit in the light, waiting)

Rigby: (Calm at first) So you're telling me that I'm meeting at this Non-Descript Coffee Shop to help you lie to my (gets angry and is shown in the light) best friend?

Margaret: Yeah.

Rigby: (Calm again, like he wasn't angry at all) But it's to keep him happy?

Eileen: Definetly.

Rigby: Awesome! (turns on another light, making the atmosphere less suspicious. He pulls out a handful of papers) Well, here's a little something I just whipped up. (Gives the papers to Del and Margaret. They look at them) Give it a once over, see what you think. (A paper is shown to be the beginning of a script) Some backstory, how you guys met.

Margaret: I don't mean to criticize, because, I mean, you're writing is really good, but this seems too complicated. Couldn't we have just met at work?

Del: I LOVE it! It has everything! Action, intrigue, hot air baloooons! Excellent work Rigby! Or should I say, director! *weird laugh*

Rigby: *confident laugh* See, Del gets it. If you don't commit to this lie, Margaret, they'll see right through it, (Margaret is shown, worried) and ALL our lives will be ruined.

(Scene then changes to The Side Line. Del and Margaret are about to walk in)

Del: *sigh* I know we just spent seven hours practicing, but I can't get rid of these moths in my stomach!

Margaret: Moths?

Del: (Starts to sweat) See, I'm getting the lines wrong already!

Margaret: Look, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be convincing. (Puts her hands on his shoulders and looks at him in the face) If one of us goes off script, we'll just go with it, ok Del?

Del: (Still sweating and speaks fast)........I think I love you.

Margaret: (They start to walk towards the door) See, acting. Just like that.

(Scene cuts to the inside of The Side Line, where CJ and Mordecai are waiting at a booth. Music is playing in the background)

Mordecai: How...uh...how ya feeling?

CJ: Fine.

Mordecai: (Starts to ramble) Sooo, you're sure you wanna do this? Cause, we don't have to do this. We could still cancel. I'm gonna cancel.

CJ: Shh, they're here. (Enthusiastically) Hey! (Everyone greets each other, all saying hey at around the same time. Del and Mordecai shake hands)

Del: Del.

Mordecai: Mordecai. I think I've seen you on TV.

Del: Please, tonight I am not "Del, Sports Anchor". I'm "Del, Margaret's Boyfriend"

Mordecai: (Concerned look) That's......that's cool. (Margaret and CJ begin to sit down) Oh hey, we're sitting.

CJ: (clears throat) We're all here.

Mordecai: Yep, yep, we are.

CJ: So, Del...Margaret, did you guys meet at work, or....

Del and Margaret: Oh, it's a funny story.....(They look at each other nervously. Margaret continues)

Margaret: It's a funny story......(Scene changes to a jungle. Margaret is seen in a safari outfit, walking) So there I was, studying abroad in the jungle, when BAM! A lion popped out of a lion hole. And then it roared so I ran. I ran...and ran..and ran. Luckily there was a hot air baloon there...

Del: ...Because there was a..hot..air..balloon..rental place.

Margaret: Yeah, I hopped in and flew away, but then I saw it. Another hot air balloon!

Del: And that was me. That was me, I was being attacked, by-by birds.

Margaret: Bald eagles. We tried to stop the bald eagles...I mean..balloons!...from..crashing. It was too late, they crashed.

Del: Our bodies collided, and we rocketed to the ground in a ball of flames, KABOOM! The doctors say we only survived because we held each other....so close. So then I looked her in the eyes and I said those immortal words..."You wanna hang out some time?" (Flashback ends and we're back at The Side Line) Aaaaand, scene.

CJ: Wow...that's a really crazy story.

Mordecai: I don't know, that kind of stuff happens to me all the time. (Drinks water)

Margaret: Yeah, it does. I can't even believe I survived going out with you. (Mordecai has a nervous look, while Del is not amused and CJ is not phased by it) Ahaha, that guy.

CJ: This guy.

Mordecai: Hehaa, meeee.

CJ: Hehe. So tell us, about your guys first date.

Del: Of course. (Gets into acting mode) It was a cold winter's day.....(Scene then goes later into the night, everything seems to be going well. Del seems to have gone into "full acting mode" with an Australian accent) And so that's why I had to change me exit for American audiences. (Everyone laughs, except Margaret, who is fake laughing)

Margaret: Oh Del, your memory of our first date is so different than mine. It's been a long night. Maybe we should get the check. (Stands up)

CJ: (Also stands up) I was hoping we could shoot some pool or something. Couple against couple! Mordecai?

Mordecai: Uh....yeah, pool, heh, yeah.

Margaret: I should probablyyyyyy.......

CJ: Huh? (Makes a motion of hitting a ball with the stick and making a crashing sound, trying to convince her) Huh?

Margaret: Uuuuhh.....say yes. (To herself)  

CJ: Cool! Let's go. (Starts to set up the table) So, how are things at the station?

Margaret: Oh, you know, still learning the ropes. (Grabs a stick) But everyone's been really supportive.

CJ: That's awesome. Hey, speaking of news, did you hear that Muscle Man and Starla are getting married?

Margaret: Heh, yeah, I'm actually part of the wedding party. Does that mean they're gonna move in together or something?

CJ: I guess so. They'll probably have to get a trailer for the trailer.

Margaret and CJ: Hahahaha (Del shows up)

Del: (Australian accent) Hello loves. You know, Marge always said when we get hitched, we'd have a charming bungalow in Connecticut.

Margaret: Haha, oh Del, (takes Del's hand off her "waist" and puts in on her shoulder) well, you know, we haven't really talked about that yet.

Del: Oh twaddle! We talked about it on the blimp, the day we meet!

Margaret: Uh...

CJ: (with Mordecai behind her) Didn't you say you met on two separate hot air balloons?

Margaret: Oh, uh.....it's a regional thing. They call them....blimp....blimpos....(to Del) can I talk to you for a second.. (they walk to the side)

CJ: ......This is fun!

Margaret: Del, what are you doing?! Things were going well and then you come in and change the story?!

Del: (Slight accent still) I'm sorry Marge, it's just....I've never felt so alive! I can't tell where Del ends and (makes quotes) Del begins!!

Margaret: What?

Del: I mean, maybe we should move to Conneticut, (his eyes are bloodshot, his accent coming back fully) I hear they have a real good school system! (Looks at his hands, his eyes darting)

Margaret: Uuuh.....ok....I think you might need a little break. Why don't you go get us some drinks?

Del: Two ripupits, coming right up! (Leaves)

Margaret: (pulls out phone and calls Rigby) Rigbyyyy........(he answers)

Rigby: Hello?

Margaret: Rigby! I need your help.

Rigby: Sure, what's up?

Margaret: Del's going way off the scri-(Rigby's voice cuts her off)

Rigby: PSYYYCH! This isn't me, it's a recording of me. I got you goooood. Leave a message after the beep. RigBEEEEEEEP.

Margaret: (frustrated and angry) Rigby, where are you?! I need you here-(she's cut off by Mordecai)

Mordecai: Hey! (Notices she was on the phone) Oh, sorry! (Begins to walk away)

Margaret: No, it's ok.

Mordecai: (Walks back) I didn't see you were...

Margaret: Yeah, no, it's cool.

Mordecai: Are you sure?

Margaret: (In a better mood) Yeah, yeah.

Mordecai: Ok, hah. (Makes motions with his hands) whoop, whoop.

Mordecai and Margaret: Hahaha.

Mordecai: (mumbles) yeah. (Regularly) I just wanted to say....I like Del, you know? He seems like a really nice guy.

Margaret: (a little nervous) Uuuuuuh, yeah. Thanks Mordecai.

Mordecai: I was a little surprised, I guess but...you seem really happy.

Margaret: Yeah. (Mordecai smiles) Yeah......well (gets nervous) he's..great, but..I..just.......UGH (smacks face). The truth about Del is-(a horn sounds off)

Announcer: K-K-K-K-KISSCAM! Who'se been spotted by the Kisscam?! (Couples are shown kissing, then Margaret and Del are shown)

Margaret: *GASP* Del?

Crowd: KISS, KISS, KISS!

Random Guy: ON THE LIPS!

CJ: Woooooh, do it!

Del: This'll look great on my reel! (Throws drinks and grabs Margaret's waist and dips her, the crowd still chanting "kiss" in slow motion)

Random Guy: (slow motion) OOOOOOOONNN TTTTHHHHHEEEEEEEE LLLIIIPPPPPSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!

CJ: KIIIIIIIISSSSSSSS!!!!!!

Margaret: (Turns away from Del)......NO! YOU'RE NOT MY BOYFRIEND!!!

Crowd: *GASP*

CJ: What?

Referee Guy: (not on intercom) Change the slide Marcus! (Changes)

Announcer: D-D-D-D-DUMPCAM! You're dumped!

CJ: What do you mean he's not your boyfriend?

Margaret: I'm sorry. I lied about the whole thing. Seemed thing the only way to make you ok with me being around. I was just...scared and tired of everything being awkward. I'm sick of feeling like a tourist around my own friends (Mordecai is seen looking down, sad/shocked)

CJ: So let me get this straight (starts to get real angry, getting grey), you're single, you dated Mordecai for a while, and you keep trying to hang out with him, even though you don't have to, cause its not like you kept in touch with him after you left. (Thunders, but is able to keep calm) *Slowly exhales* All those things are fine...*sigh*..except that you lied about it. There's only one reason you would lie about something like that. So as long as we're all just....all out here telling the truth, why don't you just tell me right now. Do you still have feelings for Mordecai? 

(Everything is silent for a moment. The crowd is on the edge of their seat, and Margaret is shown, on the screen still)

Margaret: I think.......(Mordecai is shown, looking back at her and waiting).....I do.

Crowd: *GASP*

Margaret: I'm sorry......I just wanted to start over.

CJ: Seems like everyone always wants to "start over", why don't you guys just get it right the first time? (Leaves)

Margaret: ......Mordec- (Mordecai is shown running after CJ) *sigh* (sits down at a booth and puts her head down, ashamed)

Del: (still in the accent) You broke me 'eart, Margaret. Good luck getting that bungalow in Conneticut by yourself. I'm keeping the kids! (walks off)

Margaret: *groans*

Del: (comes back) Aaaaaand, scene.

(End of Not Great Double Date)

(The episode starts with Benson having an announcement with Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, Skips. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost. They are all standing in the park's carpark.)

Benson: Okay, everyone. Unfortunately, the government just passed a new law. Starting today all park employees must pass an annual fitness test in order to keep their job. (The Park members groan.)  I know. I know. I don't want to be here any more than you do. So let's get this over with so we can get back to work.(Park members murmur. A montage is shown of Benson writing and ticking off the check list on his clipboard as the park members take their annual fitness test. We see the checklist Benson is ticking off. Benson and the park members are up to the last part of the fitness test, in front of a pull up bar) All right, guys. Last part of the fitness test. Just do one pull-up, and we can get out of here.

(Pops does his pull up with ease)

Rigby: Dude, this test was so easy.

Mordecai: I know, right? What a waste of time.

Rigby: Do you wanna go play some video games after this?

Mordecai: Ye-e-ah, I do!

Benson: Mordecai. Rigby. Quit talking and get on the bar.

Mordecai: See you on the other side. (He walks away and goes does his pull up with ease) Boom!

(Park members cheer for Mordecai except for Rigby)

Rigby: (walks up to the pull up bar) Time to show all you chumps how to do a pull-up like a real man.

(Rigby jumps up and gets a hold of the bar, but struggles to even pull himself up. The park members are looking up at Rigby)

Muscle Man: Whomp-whomp. Wh-whomp... Who-o-mp.

Rigby: Stop talking!

Mordecai: Come on, dude. Quit messing around and just do the pull-up.

Rigby: I'm... trying!

(Rigby tries to pull himself up and swings in frustration that he loses grip of the bar and falls to the ground. Muscle Man laughs)

Muscle Man: Oh, man! You can't even do one pull-up? (points at Rigby)

Rigby: Yes, I can! (slaps Muscle Man away) It was only because you distracted me with that stupid noise!

Muscle Man: Oh, so it was the noise's fault that you can't do a pull-up. Is that it?

Rigby: Yes! Yes! (pushes Muscle Man away) It was that stupid noise!

Muscle Man: Fine. Then go again.

Rigby: Don't make that noise again!

Muscle Man: I won't. I promise.

(Rigby jumps up.)

Muscle Man: Whomp-whomp! Wh-who-o-mp!

(Rigby screams and falls down [and doesn't even touch the bar]. Muscle Man laughs)

Benson: Cool it, Muscle Man. Let's go, Rigby. Just do the pull-up.

(Rigby sighs and jumps up to the bar and struggles to pull up. The park members are surprised at Rigby and Mordecai looks unimpressed.)

Pops: Oh, how embarrassing!

Mordecai: Dude, come on!

(Rigby struggles and whines that he can't do a pull-up. Rigby has a sad face and drops down from the bar. Muscle Man laughs at Rigby)

Muscle Man: (laughs) Oh, man! He can't even do one pull-up!

Benson: I'm sorry, Rigby, but I can't give you a passing grade on the test. If you can't do a pull-up by the end of the week, I'm gonna have to fire you.

(All the park members walk away except for Rigby)

Rigby: But... Whatever, I was just tired! I'll be able to do a pull-up. You'll see.

(The scene cuts to changes to Pops' house and a view of the cover of a video game called Gym Class is shown)

Rigby: Time to warm up with some Gym Class! "Because you know it's better than the real thing."

(Rigby is playing the Pull Up level and is button mashing the controller with ease. The character of Gym Class is doing rapid pull ups. Mordecai walks up to Rigby)

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing?

Rigby: What does it look like? I'm training to do a pull-up.

Mordecai: Dude, that's not doing anything!

Rigby: If it's not doing anything, then how come I'm already breaking a sweat?

Mordecai: Um, I don't know. Maybe because you're really out of shape?

Rigby: Does this look like I'm out of shape? (Rigby presses the buttons faster and the power meter goes up rapidly. Rigby beats the Pull Up level and goes 'Wooooo!'. The 'Carbo-Load' in the game increases by a lot. Rigby quickly grabs a packet of chips near him and stuffs his mouth with them) Carbo-loading!!

Mordecai: (Mordecai snatches the packet off Rigby)Rigby! You got to take this seriously!

Rigby: Oh, I got to take it seriously? Is this serious enough for you? (pulls out his walkie talkie and presses the talk button) Benson, I'm ready to do my pull-up now.

(Scene changes to all the park members at the pull-up bar)

Benson: All right. Let's get this over with.

Rigby: Here's how we do it in Gym Class, losers.

(Rigby jumps up to the bar. Rigby's arms are shaking)

Benson: Well?

Rigby: I'm trying!

(Benson, Skips and Pops laugh at Rigby, who is struggling on the pull up bar)

Mordecai: Come on, Rigby. Just get it over with.

(Rigby struggles and drops down in front of Benson, sighing)

Benson: (stern voice) You have until Friday. (walks away)

(Scene changes to Rigby at the coffee shop by himself with a cup of coffee. Eileen walks up to him with a coffee jug)

Eileen: Hey, Rigby. Is anything wrong?

Rigby: (takes a quick sip of coffee, speaking in an aggressive tone) No, I'm fine.

Eileen: Are you upset 'cause you can't do a pull-up and you might get fired?

Rigby: What?! Who told you that?

Eileen: Muscle Man was in here earlier. He was selling tickets to watch you fail.

(A tear off poster is seen with Rigby on it, naming him 'The Weakest Man in the World', and has been torn off twice)

Rigby: (groans) Maybe he's right. I can't believe I'm gonna lose my job over a stupid pull-up.

Eileen: You know, maybe I can help you. I was on the pep squad in high school.

Rigby: (scoffs) Thanks, Eileen, but I'm gonna need a lot more than pep to do a pull-up.

(Eileen pulls a shop stool and jumps off that, then off the table and grabs ahold of a pipe and does a few pull ups with ease and jumps off back onto the floor. She then pours more coffee into Rigby's cup with the coffee jug. Rigby looks at her in shock)

Eileen: Training starts after my shift. (walks away with the coffee jug)

(Scene changes to night at the coffee shop, and Eileen changes the sign from 'Open' to 'Closed'. She walks up to Rigby who is standing on a stool in the passageway, with a bar in between the entrance)

Eileen: All right! Give it a try!

(Rigby jumps up to the bar but struggles)

Rigby: (straining) Ugh, this is too hard.

Eileen: I think I see the problem. You're not visualizing your own success.

Rigby: Huh?

Eileen: You need to see it. Close your eyes.

(Rigby closes his eyes)

Eileen: Now visualize yourself doing a pull-up.

(Rigby opens his eyes)

Rigby: I can't.

Eileen: Come on, you're not trying! Close your eyes and really concentrate. What do you see?

(Rigby closes his eyes and opens them)

Rigby: A grilled cheese sandwich.

Eileen: Okay, okay. Picture that sandwich. Now picture your goal -- doing that one pull up.

(Rigby closes his eyes)

Eileen: Can you see it?

(We see Rigby's visualization. A grilled cheese sandwich is rolling across the scene. The character of Gym Class scrolls across. Muscle Man's head scrolls making the stupid noise and Rigby's fist punches Muscle Man's head. The head says 'Not cool bro'. Eileen saying 'One pull up' is echoing. Rigby's arm waves around and turns into a pull up bar. Rigby is pulling himself up, and zooms out to the real life)

Rigby: Look! I'm almost -- (drops down) Man, I almost had it!

Eileen: (nods) We'll get there.

(Eileen and Rigby are dressed in their gym clothes, and a montage is shown of them training for the pull up. Rigby is now hanging onto the bar and Eileen is in front of him)

Eileen: Come on, Rigby. We're almost out of time! You can do this!

Rigby: I can do this!

Eileen: (chanting) One pull-up! One pull-up!

Rigby: One pull-UP! (struggles and drops down. Rigby takes off his beanie and throws it down on the ground) This is hopeless! I'm never gonna be able to do this!

(Rigby runs out of the coffee shop and Eileen runs after him)

Eileen: Rigby! Rigby, wait! (stands at the coffee shop entrance) I know you can do it.

(Cut to Rigby without his gym clothes walking in town)

Rigby: This is so lame! Lame government fitness test! Lame arms! Why's it got to be so hard?!

(Rigby stops at a shop with its light on and the TV at the wall. The TV is showing an advertisement)

Man on Advertisement: (Russian accent) Feeling weak? Looking pathetic? If you're watching television, you probably are! Luckily, this TV commercial can save you! If you want muscle fast, but hate working out, then you need The Russian!

Rigby: Yeah, I do.

Man: The Russian uses electrotherapy to shock your muscles into growing. There's no effort from you. Just switch it on and you'll be stronger in no time

(Men on TV are using The Russian and suddenly have muscles)

Man: Thank you, The Russian! (karate chops chair with ease)

Rigby: Ahh yeah! That's exactly what I need. (The scene then cuts to Pops' house at night and Rigby puts the box of The Russian on the living room table. Rigby takes off the lid of The Russian. He takes the instructions from the box.) Do not operate The Russian for more than ten minutes a day. Pfft. (throws instructions out). Well, I wanna get extra bulk! So I'll need it on for eleven. (Rigby puts The Russian pads on his body and flips the switch and turns on the knob to 11. The machine buzzes) Those jerks better buy their tickets for the gun show tomorrow! (Rigby jumps on the couch, turns on the TV and grabs the packet of chips and starts eating them.) Thanks, The Russian! (falls asleep)

(The scene changes to day where the park members and Eileen at the pull up bar, except for Rigby. Benson looks at his watch)

Benson: Where the heck is Rigby? We're almost out of time!

Pops: Maybe his nerves got the better of him.

Mordecai: No, he'll be here.

Muscle Man: He better. 'Cause I got a lot of people here who paid good money to watch him try. (Zooms out and an audience is behind Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost) Let me remind you -- there are no refunds in the event of a no-show.

(Crowd mutters)

Eileen: This is weird. Rigby trained really hard for this. He wouldn't just blow it off. I'll go check on him (runs off to Pops' house and opens the door) Rigby? Oh, there you are. (walks in) You got to  (Eileen screams. Rigby is seen with huge muscles and he gasps)

Rigby: It worked!

Eileen: What did you do?!

Rigby: I used The Russian to get totally ripped! This is awesome! Now to go bust out my pull-up!

(Rigby gets off the sofa and breaks the sofa and floor)

Rigby: Huh? (tries to get down and breaks the table, The Russian and more of the floor) My muscles are too heavy! I can't stand up!

Eileen: Oh, Rigby, there are no shortcuts to physical fitness.

Rigby: Oh, no, I'm gonna lose my job! (struggles to get up and drops down) No, no, no, no! (slaps the ground and breaks more. Rigby sighs)

Eileen: Come on, you can still make it.

(Eileen tries to pull Rigby)

Rigby: Aw, it's hopeless!

Eileen: No, it's not! There's still time! Do what I say! Close your eyes!

(Rigby closes his eyes)

Eileen: Now picture that pull-up bar! Do you see it?

(We see Rigby's visualization. The mist clears out and the pull-up bar at the park is seen)

Rigby: I see it! I see the pull-up bar!

Eileen: Then go do it!!

(Rigby screams and uses his arms to get out of the house)

Eileen: You're doing it! Just use your arms! Keep going! That's it!

(Rigby gets out of the house and Eileen runs after him)

Benson: (holding the stopwatch) Pfft, he's late!

(Benson puts down his stopwatch and reveals Rigby and Eileen running to the pull-up bar)

Benson: What is that?

(The rest of the park members talk amongst themselves)

Mordecai: It's Rigby!

(Rigby uses his arms to get to the pull-up bar and screams)

Benson: You've only got 30 seconds left!

(The crowd cheers for Rigby, who climbs up the pull-up bar sides, and the ground starts cracking. Rigby gets to the pull up bar.)

Rigby: Yes!!

(But before he can do a pull up, Rigby sinks further into the ground and the ground cracks more. The pull-up bar is still on the surface and a huge hole is made. Eileen looks down the hole and calls for Rigby. Rigby is at the bottom of the hole and is groaning.)

Eileen: Rigby, you have 15 seconds to get up here and do a pull-up!

Rigby: 15 seconds?!

(Rigby punches the sides of the hole and discovers he can use it to get back to the surface. Rigby finally does his pull-up)

Benson: (stops stopwatch) Time!

(The stopwatch is revealed to have one second left and the crowd cheers)

Benson: You did it, Rigby! You can stay at the park!

(Rigby is being taken into the ambulance on a stretcher. Eileen runs up to Rigby)

Eileen: Rigby! You were wonderful!

Rigby: Thanks, Eileen. I couldn't have done it without you. I'd hug you, but I should probably wait till these muscles go away. I don't want to break your spine.

(Eileen takes off her glasses)

Eileen: I'll take my chances. (Rigby hugs Eileen and her spine breaks whilst tearing up) Totally worth it.

(End of One Pull Up)

(Episode begins with a cold open as the park flies up into space whilst people are panicing)

Justin Brink: Confusion. Chaos. That was the scene in the city earlier today as the Park blasted off into the sky. Who is responsible?

(the screen flashes, it then shows journalists talking to Mr. Maellard)

Mr. Maellard: (angry) I'm rich! No cameras!

(the screen flashes again, as a person than talks to Margaret about what happened)

Person: And then it sounded like a Kuff-wah. No! Wait! it sounded like a.

(the screen flashes again, as a Italian person then talks to the journos about what happened)

Italian Person: Booma! And the parks from different countries around the world.

(the screen flashes again, as an Indian person outside the Taj Mahal talks about what happened)

Indian Person: Have mysteriously been launched into space taking along with them.

(the screen flashes again, as an African person talks in the African jungle about what happened and a dome is in the background)

African Person: Animals and.

(the screen flashes again, as a French person talks i about what happened and a dome is in the background taking his car)

French Person: My car! (he tries to get it) Hey!

(the screen flashes for the final time, as Margaret then says something)

Margaret: Well, all this reporter can do now is hope that everyone is holding it together up there.

(She then looks up at the sky, outer space shows as Benson screams then everyone's shown panicking)

Benson: Why am I still wearing this thing?!

(Takes the printer off and then breaks it. Skips and Muscle Man are on their phones)

Skips: There's no cell service!

Muscle Man: I need to call my wife! HOW AM I GONNA CALL MY WIFE?!

Eileen: Be careful what you write in your dream journal, Eileen. You might just get it.

High Five Ghost: Oh, no! Im lost forever! Were gonna starve to death and die out here!

(Rigby runs to button and is about to press it)

Rigby: We got to press the button again!

(Mordecai picks Rigby up)

Mordecai: No, we got to calm-

(Rigby breaks free and rapidly presses the button)

Rigby: Go back, go back, go back, go back.

(Rigby starts crying)

Rigby: Im a high school graduate. Im too young to die in space.

(Everybody starts panicking)

Mordecai: Stop!

(Everybody stops and listens)

Mordecai: Everybody calm down. Weve done this before, guys. Last time we got trapped in the dome, we panicked right? But then we banded together and figured it out. We cant fall apart now. We are going to figure out how to get home, but we have to survive first. All we have to do is make it through one day at a time.

Benson: Mordecai is right. Well handle this like we handle everything else, with a morning meeting.

(Cuts to everyone at the stairs)

Benson: All right, the most important thing is that we call Maellard so we can get off this thing and back to Earth. In the meantime Im gonna be setting some survival tasks. First up is Skips. Im gonna need you to go around the park and look for a cellphone signal. We have no other way to contact earth, so this is priority number one.

Skips: Hmm

Benson: Mordecai and Rigby, you go explore the tunnels under the park.

Rigby: Aw, man. Its creepy down there.

Benson: I dont want to hear it. Pops and Eileen, I need you to take inventory of the food supplies. We have no idea how long well be out here so we better make the most of it. Muscle Man and Hi Fives. Youre in charge of finding building supplies, first aid, and anything else we might be able to use.

(Cuts to everybody doing their jobs with Benson, Pops, Eileen, Muscle Man, and High Five Ghost outside the house)

Benson: Well, it looks like Mordecai and Rigby arent back yet, so Pops and Eileen how about an update?

Eileen: Well, we found an unusual amount of small foods, baby carrots, baby corn, and some fingerlings, which are basically baby potatoes.

Pops: The garden was recently ravaged by a weevil blight, so at this point, were just left with a large variety of onions.

Muscle Man: So, we only have dirt vegetables and baby food?

Eileen: Well, what did you guys find?

Muscle Man: Feast your eyes on this

Eileen: A talk and Text, some rebar, a Bundt cake pan? 

Benson: How'd it go for you, Skips?

Skips: I couldn't get a signal, and all this after they upsold me on the extended coverage too.

High Five Ghost: Typical.

Eileen: Hey, maybe I can use this to help boost the cell phone signal.

Benson: Yes, yes! this! This is a plan, Eileen gets it.

Eileen: Thanks.

Benson: You start building whatever you need, everybody help Eileen. Now where are Mordecai and Rigby?

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa, space carts.

Mordecai: These things are hard to control.

Mordecai and Rigby: [Laughing]

Mordecai: Dude, we're in space.

Rigby: Yeah.

Mordecai: What if we're stuck here forever?

Rigby: Might not be so bad. I mean we basically have the park and all the stuff we normally have, also I've got Eileen and you have [Pause] me. And we have spaceships. Maybe this is how we become space pilots, unless that timeline is destroyed, I don't know.

Mordecai: Yeah, but we'll probably make it back to Earth.

Benson: What are you two doing? No one's heard from you for 2 hours!

Mordecai: Sorry, Benson. we were exploring and then we found these space carts.

Rigby: Yeah, and they were already crashed and stuff.

Benson: I don't care, I don't care. I DON'T CARE! We have a plan now, quit goofing off and get to the surface! Well, while you two were goofing off, we were getting stuff done top-side. Eileen?

Eileen: Almost ready to go, this primitive signal amp should get us a few bars, we have another problem, though. Over the past few hours, I noticed that the Earth is getting farther and farther away.

Benson: Well, it looks like it's time to call home. Skips, flip that switch.

Benson: Aah! We're gonna die! (Gasps) Drifting in space, no way in communicating with earth... Thanks for getting us stuck in space, Rigby!

Rigby: You pushed that button, too!

Benson: Your hand was on top of mine!

Rigby: I was just going with the flow!

Benson: Going with the flow? I'll show you going with the flow!

Eileen: Stop! Stop it! This is not helpful!

(The Short begins with Mordecai and Rigby are setting up a catapult in the Park.)

Mordecai: We only get one shot at this, so let's make it count. You ready to make history?

Rigby: Hmph!

(Rigby chucks a basketball at the cart's accelerator. The cart has a basketball hoop on the back, it drives off, as Rigby runs to put the basketball in the catapult. Both of them pull the catapult back)

Mordecai: Hold it...now!

(They release the basketball from the catapult as it flies through the air. The cart crashes into a tree and catches fire, but they manage to make the shot anyway. Mordecai and Rigby stare at it for a moment, before giving one massive...)

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

(They don't stop shouting "oh" for a long time, and continue to say it while going to multiple places. They pass Skips in the living room, leave the Park, shout passed Mount Rushmore, onto an airplane, inside of the airplane, passed a farmer on Ireland's Rock of Cashel, the Eiffel Tower in France, Brandenburg Gate in Germany, Sumo Tournament in Japan, the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil, some huts in Papua New Guinea, the Sydney Opera House in Australia, the Gyeongbokgung Palace in South Korea, and the Great Wall of China. Cut to a funeral service)

Vicar: We are here to mourn the passing of Mordecai and Rigby, who said "oh" until they died of exhaustion. No-one knows why they said it for so long. Some say it was because they were just really cool, others say it was because they sank the sickest shot in history, we may never know. All we know is that they're definitely dead. In conclusion - 

(Mordecai and Rigby suddenly jump out of their coffins)

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOHHHHHH!!!!!

(they continue to shout this in a cable car going up the Matterhorn, the Canadian Rockies, Antarctica, and finally back in the Park. They high five eachother and laugh. Benson walks up to them)

Benson: Hey, you two. Have you seen the cart anywhere? It's been missing since this morning.

Mordecai & Rigby: Uhh, no.

(End of OOOHH!!!)

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby driving the golf cart in the park. They are jamming to music as they begin to laugh.)

Rigby: Aw, yeah. Listen to that engine purr! Thanks to the cart, we picked up this manure in record time.

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. With this cart, there's no lame job Benson can give us that we can't handle. Hey, speaking of jobs, we're late for the staff meeting.

Rigby: Punch it.

(Mordecai steps on the gas, and they yell excitedly. They drive up to Benson, who doesn't look happy)

Benson: Oh, look who decided to show up.

Mordecai and Rigby: Sorry, Benson.

(They take their place on the steps)

Benson:  (annoyed) As I was saying, I crunched the numbers and the park has extra money this year. Mordecai and Rigby, you can take this hunk of junk to the dump.

Mordecai and Rigby: Wuh?

Benson: 'Cause I bought us this. 

(Shows them the Smarten Karten as the screen cuts to it) 

Benson (contiuned): Say guten tag to the Smarten Karten.

Smarten Karten: (Voice) Guten tag.

(Everyone jeers and heads to the new cart, much to Mordecai and Rigby's disappointment)

Benson: Modern, sophisticated, powerful. These are three adjectives used to describe this miracle of German engineering.

Skips: Whoa! This thing has 100 horsepower!

Pops: A device that holds beverages. 

(He laughs)

Muscle Man: (Gasps) No way! A butt warmer! 

(Presses the 'seat warmer' button and relaxes. Pops laughs again.)

Mordecai: Who needs all that stuff? 

(He and Rigby rush over to the old cart) 

Mordecai (continued): Here are a few words to describe the cart. Reliable, uh, classic...

(Mordecai sniffs it and immediately becomes grossed out)

Mordecai: Won't smell like manure later.

Rigby: These seats are vintage simulated vinyl.

Mordecai:  And look at these classic details.

Benson: Those are stickers.

Mordecai: Dude, Benson, the cart's been at the park forever. It's like a member of the family.

Rigby: It's the eighth worker of the park.

Benson: That cart's engine is on its last legs. It's releasing noxious gas fumes into the air.

Rigby: We're not taking Muscle Man to the dump and he releases noxious fumes all the time!

(Hearing this makes Muscle Man try to charge at them, only for HFG to stop him)

High Five Ghost: No! He's not worth it.

Benson: Guys, guys. I know you've had a lot of good times in that cart. But it's not cost effective. Who's gonna pay the bills for it?

Mordecai: We'll pay 'em.

Benson: So, you'll pay the gas bill.

Mordecai: Done.

Benson: And the repair bills. Not to mention insurance, tags, and the occasional tetanus shot.

Rigby: Pfff!

Benson: Okay.

Mordecai: Uh...

(Benson hands them lots of paper, and one of them has a total of 2,000 dollars)

Mordecai and Rigby: $2,000?!

Benson: That's right. Paid in full every month for the rest of your life.

Mordecai: (Dejectedly) You've made your point.

Benson: Now take the cart to the dump by the end of the day or you're fired!

(Mordecai and Rigby are parked up at the airport drinking sodas. They see an airplane come in. Mordecai sighs.')

Mordecai: We'd better get going to the dump.

Rigby: It's not fair, man. It's not fair to the cart!

Mordecai: Dude, I love the cart too. But we can't afford to keep it. Now let's pour one out on the hood, for old cart's sake.

Rigby: Word.

(They shed tears and pour soda on the cart. it goes through the engine, causing it to electrocute.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Huh?

(They jump out and back away as the cart appears to come to life.)

Cart: Woah.

(It moves around a little.)

Cart (continued): Is this what it's like to be conscious?

(Mordecai and Rigby are stunned.)

Mordecai: How is this possible?

(Rigby looks at the soda. It is called "Thunder Jolt X: 10x the Caffeine".)

Rigby: Woah.

(They walk up to Cart.)

Mordecai: This is awesome.

Cart: I am happy also, entity Mordecai and entity Rigby.

Mordecai: Dude, you know us. Call us Mordecai and Rigby.

Rigby: Don't you have a name?

Cart: Well, according to the writing on my insides, it's Hecho. Hech en Mexico.

Rigby: We'll just call you Cart.

Cart: Wow, my first nickname! A lotta good that'll do me now that you have to take me to the dump.

(He turns away from them.)

Cart: I've only been alive for 30 seconds and I already know that life is cruel. And to think, I've still never felt a delicate touch of a lady cart.

Rigby: I can't stand it!

(Cart turns back to the guys.)

Mordecai: Cart, you deserve better than this.

Rigby: Before you go to the dump, we'll take you to experience all the thing you never got to do.

(They go into Cart.)

Cart: Wow, you'd do that? For old cart's sake?

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. For old cart's sake.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm hmm hmm hmm!

Mordecai: So what do you wanna do first, Cart?

Cart: Well...

(Cart plays his radio and straps Mordecai and Rigby in. They scream as he spins a donut and they drive off. As the music plays, a montage begins. At a concert, Cart appears on the stage and Mordecai and Rigby cheer him on with the crowd. He then gets crowd surfed all the way to the end of the crowd, to which Mordecai and Rigby hi five. At a bridge, Cart is connected to a cord and he bungee jumps off it. At a tattoo shop, Cart gets a tattoo with a US Flag, eagle and his name. Later, Mordecai and Rigby hook him up to a red Volkswagon New Beetle. They then take him to Cheezers, where they decide to orderr in. Cart goes inside after them, dismantling the door. They are now seen enjoying Cheezers together while the door is being repaired.)

Mordecai: I gotta say, Cart, you're a pretty cool guy.

Cart: Heh. Right back at ya, Brodecai.

Benson: (via walkie talkie) Mordecai, Rigby, are you there?

(Cart snickers.)

Cart: Dude, dude! Answer in a French accent.

Mordecai: What? No way. (to Benson) Hey, Benson.

Cart: Wa-wa-wait. Tell him we just picked up his mama!

(He snickers again, and Rigby joins him. Mordecai punches Rigby.)

Mordecai: Dude, shut up!

Benson: (via walkie talkie) You guys were due back hours ago.

Mordecai: Sorry, we-

Benson: (via walkie talkie) I don't care! Get back here or you're fired!

(Mordecai sighs.)

Mordecai: Alright. We better head to the dump.

(Cart is no longer with them.)

Rigby: Where's Cart?

Mordecai: Ah, what?! Did he ditch us?!

Rigby: Oh no! This is just like that time Benson had us take care of his dog, then we took the dog to Cheezers and then the dog ran away!

(Cart is seen near the trash can.)

Mordecai: Wait. There he is.

(They walk over to him.)

Mordecai (continued): Cart, what are you doing?

Cart: Sorry, guys. I was just throwing away our trash. Kinda like how you're gonna throw me away. You know, at the dump?

Mordecai: Come on, Cart, it's not like that.

Cart: Is that all I am? Just a...used up old taco wrapper?

(Mordecai sighs. Cart turns to the guys.)

Cart (continued): You know what'd make me feel better?

Mordecai: What?

Cart: If I could get a view of the sunset.

(Rigby points at the sunset.)

Rigby: Yeah! That sunset is prime send-off material. Let's goooooooooooo.

Mordecai: I don't know.

Cart: Come on buddy, just one more drive. For old cart's sake?

(Mordecai sighs.)

Mordecai: I can't say no to that face.

(Cut to the three watching the sunset on a rooftop.)

Cart: Wow, it's....magnificent. Just seeing such beauty gives meaning to me short life, an even shorter life as a sentient being. I really feel at peace.

Mordecai: That's great, dude. Alright, let's get going.

(They try to get into Cart but he drives away from them.)

Cart: Y-You know, I've never been to a..a, a car wash. Yeah.

Mordecai: But we washed you all the time!

Cart: No, I mean a real car wash. Look, I know you wouldn't understand because you aren't a golf cart, but, I don't wanna go without experiencing this.

Rigby: But we'll get soaked!

Cart: Yeah, well I'm getting crushed. Seems like the least you could do, with me being crushed and all.

(Mordecai and Rigby feel guilty. Scene cuts to the City Car Wash, where Cart is passing through while Moredcai and Rigby are soaped, soaked and dried. They exit the car wash.)

Cart (continued): Thanks so much, guys. It really means a lot to me.

(Mordecai and Rigby come out of Cart.)

Cart (continued): And now that I'm clean, I'm ready for my final wish.

Rigby: Aw, what? You said the "last thing" was the last thing!

Cart: I promise this is it. One last wish, for old cart's sake.

Mordecai: Okay, fine. But that's it.

(Cart spins a donut.)

Cart: Nice! Let's gooooooooo!

(Mordecai and Rigby go back in.)

Rigby: Where to, exactly?

Cart: You'll see.

(They drive off. Cut to a restaurant where bikes are parked.)

Cart (continued): Seriously, you dudes are gonna love this.

Mordecai: Family Restaurant?

Rigby: Why is everything in quotes?

(The three enter the restaurant. Mordecai and Rigby look around in shock)

Hooligan 1: Hey! I asked for the dressing separate! Separate!

Owner: Take it up with the complaints department! Right here!

Puppies Man: Puppies!

Kittens Man: Kittens!

Puppies Man: Puppies!

Kittens Man: Kittens!

(Kittens Man punches Puppies Man)

Owner: Hey! You gonna order something?

Cart: Engine oil. Black.

Mordecai: Ooh, I get it! Oil's on me.

(The owner pours the cart a glass of engine oil)

Mordecai: You should have just us you wanted to find an oil change!

Hooligan 2: Hey! Don't you know that grade of oil causes unnecessary wear and tear on your engine?

Cart: Well maybe I've got a deathwish, pal!

Hooligan 2: Jokers like you should be taken to the dump. 

(Hooligan 2 takes a drink)

Hooligan 2: You make me wanna puke!

(He walks off.)

Cart: Pfft. Jerk.

Mordecai: Okay, haha, you've had your last drink! 

Rigby: Let's hurry to the dump, it's getting late!

Cart: Oh, this? This isn't the last thing.

Rigby: Huh? Then what is it?

Cart: Watch this.

(Cart drives off and runs over the hooligan)

Cart: I've always wanted to get into a fight!

(The Hooligan goes to punch the cart, but the cart dodges, causing the Hooligan to punch a random man)

Hooligan 3: Hence fighting words!

(The Hooligans start fighting, and Mordecai and Rigby get grabbed by some hooligans)

Hooligan 4: Hate this music!

(He punches two more hooligans next to him. Everybody fights)

Cart: Who wants some?

(Everybody attempts to attack the Cart, but he beats everybody easily. Mordecai punches a hooligan to free Rigby)

Rigby: Cart!

(Hooligan 2 throws a box onto Cart's roof and laughs)

Mordecai: Hey!

(Mordecai and Rigby punch the Hooligan. The owner comes along and tackles them as Cart drives off. Mordecai and Rigby get thrown out the restaurant)

Owner: And stay out! This is a decent "Family Establishment!" Don't need you "low lives" messing things up!

(The owner heads back into the restaurant as Mordecai and Rigby groan)

Mordecai: Wait a minute, where's the Cart? I knew it! He ditched us! We should've taken him to the dump when we had the chance! We're so fired, dude!

Rigby: Mordecai, look! An oil trail!

(Mordecai and Rigby follow the oil trail to the edge of a cliff)

Mordecai: There he is! Cart...what are you doing up here?

Cart: I - I'm so sorry, you guys. I - I just didn't want you to have to see me like this.

Mordecai: It's alright, dude. Can we please just go to the dump now?

Cart: If I have to go, I'm gonna do it my way. I wanna be sent off this cliff, into the ocean, filled with fireworks from a third world country, to go out in a blaze of glory. That's my final - final wish.

Mordecai: That's - the coolest thing I've ever heard.

(Cut to later, the Cart is now filled with fireworks)

Mordecai: Alright. That's the last of them.

Cart: Thanks, you guys.

Mordecai: Do you have any regrets?

Cart: Well I never did write that novel. But I've seen things other carts wouldn't believe. I've started an all-out brawl at a family restaurant. I've watched sunbeams shimmer over the city from the highest parking ramp. My only regret is that I couldn't hold more fireworks.

Mordecai: Yeah, but it's still a lot.

Cart: Yeayuh, it is!

Mordecai, Rigby & Cart: OOHHHH!!!

Cart: Let's get this show on the road.

(The Cart revs its engine, while Mordecai prepares to light off the fireworks)

Mordecai: Good luck, old friend.

(The Cart drives off the cliff as fireworks go off. The cart lands in the water, creating a huge splash)

Mordecai: Coolest decommissioning ever.

Rigby: Totally cool.

(Benson rings in on the guys' walkie talkie)

Benson: Mordecai! Rigby!

Mordecai: Hello?

Benson: There's been an accounting error. I forgot to carry a zero and it turns out we can't afford the new cart, and the seat warmer gave Muscle Man third degree burns on 70% of his butt.

(Muscle Man is seen screaming and burning while firefighters attempt to put the fire out)

Benson: We need you to bring the old cart back. I bet you two are glad to hear that. You know, it wasn't such a bad old cart after all.

(The cart's engine is heard failing, as Mordecai and Rigby watch over him. Mordecai sighs)

Mordecai: Let's go get it.

(The episode begins at the hospital. Rigby is lying dead on a stretcher, and Mordecai, Pops, Skips and Benson are standing around him.)

Doctor: [shuts Rigby's eyes and pulls sheet over him] I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do.

(Mordecai, Pops and Benson bow their heads. Mordecai looks at Skips.)

Mordecai: (spitefully) You couldn't let it go. Well, I hope you got what you wanted.

(They all leave, while Skips looks after Rigby. Flashback begins at McHooligan's.)

Benson: Hey. Let me tell you guys something. This guy, this guy right here is so strong. He could take any one of you out in arm wrestling.

Skips: Nah nah. (laughs modestly)

Benson: Skips, Skips. I am your boss, and as your boss, I order you to arm wrestle me.

(Everyone chants 'Skips')

Skips: Alright, alright, if you insist. (slams Benson's arm)

Everyone: OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Benson: What did I tell you, what did I tell you?

Pops: Oh, oh, me, me!

(Skips slams Pops' arm. Pops giggles)

Mordecai: Set 'em up Skips, you can't take none of this. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah!

(Skips slams Mordecai's arm)

Mordecai: OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

(Everyone chants as Skips slams Hi Five Ghost. Skips slams Muscle Man. Everyone chants 'Skips')

Rigby: Now me.

(Everyone laughs)

Rigby: C'mon Skips, set 'em up.

Skips: Okay, I'll go easy on you. (clasps Rigby's hand)

Benson: This is gonna be hilarious. Okay, ready, go!

(Rigby slams Skips)

Rigby: Haters gonna hate!

(Everyone laughs)

Skips: Enough! We're going again, I wasn't ready.

Rigby: Maybe. Or maybe you're just getting weak in your old age, gramps.

(Skips and Rigby clasp hands)

Benson: Okay, ready, go!

(Everyone chants 'go'. Rigby slams Skips)

Rigby: Yeah, yeah yeah! Who's the strongest now? Two in a row!

(Everyone cheers and leaves. Skips stays behind)

Mordecai: That was awesome, man.

Rigby: It's all in the wrist. And also it's in the muscles.

(Cut to Skips sitting on the front steps. Pops sits next to him)

Pops: Hi, Skips. You sure did a bang up job at arm wrestling yesterday. You were beating everyone.

Skips: I didn't beat Rigby.

Pops: Yes, he's quite the arm wrestler, isn't he?

Skips: I'm not the strongest anymore.

Pops: Balderdash! You are the strongest person I know. You were just having a bad day. You should go up to Rigby and demand a rematch. Then you'll see who the strongest is. [giggles and walks away]

Skips: Thanks, Pops.

[Cut to Mordecai and Rigby inside playing Guitar Dudes Reunion Tour.] 


Mordecai: Here comes the power move! [presses a button on guitar]

Mordecai: [laughs] Dude, this is just like playing real guitar!

Rigby: Check this out! [plays guitar behind his head]

Rigby: No!

Mordecai: Dude, dodge the bottles! Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right!

Mordecai: Aww, what?

Rigby: Come on!

Skips: Rigby! Me, you, rematch.

Rigby: No.

Skips: I said I want a rematch!

Rigby: I'm busy.

Mordecai: Dude, not cool.

Rigby: Eh. He'll get over it.

[Cut to Skips working out in his room. Benson knocks.]

Skips: Come in.

Benson: Skips? Skips did you break their video game?

Rigby: Yes, yes he did! I already told you!

Benson: I want to hear it from him.

Rigby: Grrrr!

Skips: Yeah.

Benson: What? Wow, uh, I'm sorry Skips, but, you're gonna have to pay for it.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm.

Skips: Oh I'll pay for it. After Rigby gives me a rematch.

Benson: What? That's what this is about?

Skips: You wouldn't understand.

Benson: [scoffs] Yeah, I guess I wouldn't understand.

Rigby: I understand. You just want to lose again. Let's go.

Skips: Set 'em up.

Benson: Ready? Go.

Benson: Make sure you pay him by the end of the week.

Skips: Yeah, I will.

Rigby: What was that? I couldn't understand you. I don't speak second place. Make sure you pay me by the end of the week.

Muscle Man: Aww, yeah! McHooligan's, round two! [slides down banister]

Hi Five Ghost: [goes with Muscle Man] Shotgun!

Benson: [walks down stairs] I hope you guys got your drink tickets 'cause the drinks are on me! Up to a dollar fifty value!

Pops: [walks down stairs] Splendid, I can't wait to get an aguarita!

Rigby: [walks down stairs] I'm gonna get me an ice on the rocks, woo!

Mordecai: Aww, man, my drink ticket!

Benson: Hey, Mordecai, let's hustle!

Mordecai: I'll be back in a sec, guys.

Mordecai: Aww, what, Skips? What are you doing?

Skips: Uh, nothing. Uh, going through Rigby's stuff. Rigby, the strongest. There's gotta be a trick.

Mordecai: Dude, Skips, I can't stand to see you like this. Listen. Don't tell him I told you this, but Rigby's been pranking you.

Skips: What!?

Mordecai: [picks up drink ticket] Two words: "Playco Arm boy". [exits] Look it up.

Father: So, you think you can take on your old man? [slams son and laughs] Easy!

Announcer: How to use Playco Arm boy! First, put on Playco Arm boy, Second, conceal Playco Arm boy, Third, sign our legal Playco Arm boy waver!

Father: Ready for round two, eh?

Father: [yelps] Aww! That really hurt, son...

Other Announcer: A subsidiary of Yoshimoto Cybernetics!

Benson: Hey, Mordecai, what ever happened to Skips?

Mordecai: Uh. He had stuff. To do.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm! Probably resting his old man bones.

Rigby: OHHHHH! Look who's back for thirds!

Benson: Don't do it, Skips.

Rigby: [props arm up] Say goodnight, gramps.

(Things then run in slow-motion Skips pulls out Rigby's Playco Armboy and arm wrestles again. He then grabs Rigby's arm, lifts him and smashes him down the table. The flashback then ends.)

Skips: I'm sorry, Rigby. I'll make it up to you.

Death: [laughs] Well, well, well. If it ain't old Skips.

Skips: Death.

Death: [laughs] You haven't changed a bit. So, what's the occasion here, Skips? Is that your buddy there? Finally killed someone, eh?

Skips: I want him back. Let's arm wrestle for him. If I win, I keep him. If you win, you can take me instead.

Death: Aww, big old Skips finally coming in for some old fashion arm wrestling, eh? 'bout time. You've been dodging me for years. Now I get to beat you and take your immortal soul?

Death: Deal.

[Death and Skips shake hands. A table appears]

Death: I've been waiting for this day. [takes off jacket to reveal an arm as muscular as Skips' and kisses it] Set 'em up.

Skips: Hmm.

Referee: Ready? Go!

Death: [laughs] Your soul is mine! [laughs and almost slams Skips' arm] Any last words, Skips?

Skips: Two words! Playco Armboy!

Death: Huh?

[Bright white beam emerges. Skips slams Death's arm. The room clears]

Death: No! How is this possible?

Skips: Death, I won. Bring Rigby back, and take a hike!

Death: Skips! Mark my words. [get in motorbike] Someday, I will have your immortal soul. [makes a portal in the wall and spits Rigby's soul into Rigby's mouth]

Skips: Listen, Rigby, sorry for, you know, killing you back there. It was unprofessional.

Rigby: Huh? [turns and sees stitches in back] You know what? Water under the bridge. So you ended up cheating death, huh?

Skips: I learned from the best. [lifts up Playco Armboy]

Rigby: Ohhhh!

Skips: Seriously though, you shouldn't cheat. I only did it to save your life.

Rigby: So, everybody thinks I'm dead?

Skips: Yep.

Rigby: Dude! We gotta prank 'em!

Skips: Uh, you know Rigby, I think I've had enough pranks for today.

(End "Over the Top")

(Episode opens with Mordecai taking a pizza pouch out of a box at Pops's House)

Mordecai: Alright, dude. Ready?

Rigby: I was born ready. Now stop talking and hit me!

Mordecai: With precision...

(He slingshots the pizza pouch and hits it above Rigby. We are then shown that the whole house is covered with pizza pouches.)

Rigby: Dude, that was like really close this time!

Mordecai: Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of the tension and... oh, hey Benson.

(Benson comes in, extremely mad. His voice is high-pitched.)

Benson: (Screaming) DID YOU PUT PIZZA ALL OVER THIS HOUSE?!! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you put pizza all over this house. (Circles around Rigby) And you, you're just as guilty. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're cleaning it too, don't worry!

(Cut to a close-up of Benson, who is examining a pizza pouch)

Benson (continued): (yells, then hits the pizza pouch with his hand)  YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!

(Clock transition. Benson is still screaming.) 

Benson (continued): (yells) This is a pressure washer! Do you know how to use it? You better, otherwise, I'm gonna fire you!

(Clock transition) 

Benson (continued): You're cleaning every last inch of this house or you're FIRED!! DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?!!

(Storms off)

Mordecai: (Sighs) Alright, let's get this over with.

(Starts the pressure washer)

Rigby: Come on; I want to use the wand.

Mordecai: No way, dude. It's a power washer. You need to have power to control it. You're too small for this thing.

Rigby: Come on, I got a low center of gravity. Nothing can knock me over. (Mordecai pushes him down) Oof!

(Mordecai chuckles. Clock transition of Mordecai walking up to the house, power wand in hand.)

Mordecai: Alright, dude. Give me some juice, but start slow! 

(Rigby mumbles as the sets the washer to a setting of two) 

Mordecai (continued): Ok, this is good.

Rigby: Are you sure you don't want it higher? There are all these other numbers on here!

Mordecai: Nope.

(Rigby sits on the ground and groans. He watches a butterfly fly past.)

Rigby: I can't take this! I'm turning it up!

(Mordecai turns around with the hose.)

Mordecai: No! Don't do it!

(Rigby gives him an a-ok sign, then turns the washer all the way up, causing water to build up pressure and scrape off some paint on the house. Rigby runs over to him.)

Rigby: I can help!

(He grabs the hose but only makes things worse. Cut to Benson inside the house, on the phone.)

Benson: So I can pick up my car tomorrow? That's great!

(Water sprays at the window and Benson watches the scene. He walks out angry. Cut to Rigby swinging in the air hanging onto the hose.)

Rigby: Mordecai, help!

(Pan down to Mordecai)

Mordecai: Dude, I'm trying!

(The pressure washer turns off and Rigby falls to the ground.)

Rigby: Dude, who turned it off?

(We pan over to Benson who is standing there, angry.)

Mordecai: Oh, no.

(Dramatic sounds are heard as we see parts of the house scrapped off. Benson walks over to the duo)

Mordecai: Sorry, Benson. We know.

Rigby: Yeah. We'll re-paint some of the messed up parts.

Benson: That's not good enough! You have to re-paint the whole thing or the paint won't match!

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Rigby: But the whole thing's like the size of the house!

Benson: Yeah. That's the idea. You have till the end of the weekend.

(Benson walks off.)

Mordecai and Rigby: UGH!

Rigby: Geez, typical Benson, right dude?

Mordecai: Whatever. Let's just get started.

Rigby: You know, I was right there with you until the whole "get started" part. We got all weekend! Let's go play some video games. You know, bro out.

Mordecai: No.

Rigby: Have some bro time.

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: Get in the bro zone? 

Mordecai: Just stop it, okay?

Rigby: Alright, what gives?

Mordecai: I got plans with CJ tomorrow, and now I'll have to ditch her because you never listen to me. I don't have time for this kinda junk anymore, okay?

Rigby: Come on, dude. I bet we can finish it all today. Then you can still see CJ tomorrow. I mean, we paint stuff all the time, right?

Mordecai: I don't know.

Rigby: We get some tunes, some suiters, and bro it out like a couple bros.

Mordecai: (chuckles) Alright, dude. Classic bro time. Let's do it.

(Rigby plays a tape, and a montage of the duo painting the house begins. At the end it's revealed the only repainted the garage door.)

Mordecai: Ugh! We're not gonna finish this today! You totally tricked me with your bro talk.

Rigby: Relax. You'll still be able to hang out with CJ.

Mordecai: How will I do that if I'm stuck here painting walls all day? This wouldn't have happened if you just listened to me in the first place!

Rigby: Okay. I can see how this is kinda my fault.

Mordecai: Kinda?

Rigby: Ok, ok. More than kinda. Look, you go hang out with CJ. I'll finish this up.

Mordecai: Yeah, right. The whole thing?

Rigby: It's ok. I got this.

Mordecai: Really?

Rigby: Yeah, no problem.

Mordecai: (sternly) Really?

Rigby: Yeah, you go. Bros helping bros.

Mordecai: (sighs) Well, thanks. (walks off) I'll see you when it's done.

(Rigby starts getting himself ready to paint.)

Rigby: Alright! Solo bro. Uno bro. Bro number one. Bro number two is with his lady. And that's cool with bro number one. Brody bro bro bro. One bro. (pauses, then goes inside) Time for a bro break.

(Cut to Rigby sitting down on the couch in front of the TV.)

RGB2: I hope you saved room for desert!

(On T.V., RGB2 is on a raft with Carter and Briggs. They are holding their respective weapons.)

Carter: Oh, we always save room...for donuts!

Carter & Briggs: Aw yeyeyeyeeyeah!

(The T.V shows an ad saying, "A WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR. STAY TUNED!")

Announcer: Return to "Carter & Briggs meet RGB2" after these messages.

(There is an ad showing Stealth Co. Rigby is awed.)

Rigby: Woah!

(The ad shows different stealth parts.)

Voice: (whispering) What is it that you need? (echo) Stealth. (echo)

(The ad shows a house.)

Voice (continued): Paint your house for free. (echo) Stealth. (echo)

(A message says: "We'll paint your house for FREE! 555-0100 Call now!

Announcer: This week only, be a part of our new experimental test phase and we'll paint your house for FREE! Call now!

Voice: Stealth. (echo)

(The house winks before fading.)

Announcer:  (swiftly) A subsidiary of the US government.

(Rigby begins dialing the number on his phone and calls. The doorbell rings.)

Rigby: Huh?

(He answers the door, only to find nobody there. He close the door.)

Rigby (continued): What the-?!

(A man is revealed to have come through the house window.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Afternoon, citizen.

Rigby: Who are you?

(He closes the window.)

Stealth Co. Agent: I'm a Stealth Co. agent from Stealth Co. Corporation.

Rigby: Wait, I was just calling a Stealth Co. about getting my house painted.

Stealth Co. Agent: I know. Just need you to sign the contract.

Rigby: Ok.

(The agent holds out the contract in front of him.)

Rigby (continued): Dude, this is like a million pages long!

Stealth Co. Agent: (flips page) Just sign here to get started.

(Rigby signs his name.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): (flips page again) And here.

(Rigby signs again.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Uh, initials here for us to paint the inside.

Rigby: And it's still free, right?

(He nods.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Mm-hmm.

Rigby: (places initials) Nice!

(The agent holds out a fingerprint scanner.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Fingerprint here.

(Rigby places his hand. The agent then scans his right eye.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Retinal scan. Aaaaaand blood sample.

(He injects a syringe into Rigby's right arm, causing him to scream.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Excellent, you are a true patriot. We'll be done in a few hours. Go ahead, go relax.

(He hands Rigby a fleece pullover.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): And please accept this complimentary fleece pullover, courtesy of Stealth Co.

Rigby: Wow!

(Rigby runs out of the house. Cut to the Coffee Shop.)

CJ: I don't know, it's just one of those things where it's like, "whoa". You know?

Mordecai: (chuckles) Yeah, I totally know.

(Rigby comes in wearing the pullover.)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Shouldn't you be painting the house?

Rigby: Oh, should I? (to Eileen) Your most relaxing drink, please.

Eileen: I'm on it.

Mordecai: Yes, you should. Quit messin' around and go finish the job!

Rigby: You can call off you dogs, Mordecai. I'm done. Because I listened to you.

CJ: See? You have nothing to worry about.

Mordecai: Yeah, alright. Cool. Thanks, Rigby.

(Rigby takes his drink from Eileen.)

Rigby: No problembro.

(Rigby takes a sip.)

Rigby (continued): Eileen, this is just hot water.

Eileen: It's good for your digestion.

(Mordecai and Rigby head back to Pops' house. Rigby throws his pullover in the trash)

Mordecai: So what do you wanna do for the rest of the weekend?

Rigby: I don't know. Maybe check out that loaded potato place.

Mordecai: (looks ahead) What?!

Rigby: It's a baked potato filled with stuff.

Mordecai: No, look. Rigby, where's the house?

(The house is no longer where it should be.)

Rigby: I don't know. It's supposed to be right- ooh!

(He bumps into something invisible.)

Rigby (continued): Ow! What happened?

(Mordecai and Rigby look up and see a bird fly into something invisible.)

Mordecai: Okay, this is weird. What did you do?

Rigby: I...You know, I just hired some professionals.

Mordecai: Rigby!

(He slides a finger at the invisible thing, and a scrape appears from before.)

Mordecai: Woah. What? What kind of guys did you hire?

Rigby: Professional guys! They seemed legit! I even signed this contract.

(He goes to a trash bin and takes the contract. He gives it to Mordecai, who looks over it.)

Mordecai: Rigby, this says "Stealth Co."! They made our house stealth!

Rigby: (gasps) What does stealth mean?

Mordecai: Aaah! I can't believe you didn't even read the contract.

Rigby: They gave me the gist of it!

(The Stealth Co. van arrives.)

Rigby (continued): Look, the Stealth Co. guy is right there. We'll just tell him to fix it.

(They walk up to the van.)

Mordecai: Hey, dude. This isn't...what we...want-

(Rigby opens the door, but the agent isn't there.)

Mordecai (continued): What the-

Rigby: Where is he?

Stealth Co. Agent: Over here.

(They look behind them, and see a still agent.)

Mordecai: Is that a piece of cardboard?

(The real agent tips down the standee.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Good eye, citizen.

(He takes out a handheld radar.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Mmm-hmm. Yes, these are satisfying results.

(He goes to the back of the van.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): As per our agreement, your house is no longer detectable by radar.

Mordecai: Yeah, or our eyes! Look, there was a misunderstanding. We don't want this!

Stealth Co. Agent: Well, that's perfect. The test phase is over, and on order to protect our formula, we will be destroying the product.

(He goes to the guys, carrying something in his arm.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): As per our agreement, you will be reimbursed $500, minus jet-refueling fees, which adds up to..64 cents.

(He place 64 cents in Rigby's hand.)

Rigby: Jet-refueling fees?

Mordecai: Wait. When are you removing the paint?

(The agent pulls out a walkie-talkie.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Let's wrap it up, boys!

Pilot: (on walkie talkie) Roger that.

Stealth Co. Agent: The jets will be here momentarily to destroy the house.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Rigby: Well, well, how are you gonna blow up an invisible house, man?

(The agent pulls out a device.)

Stealth Co. Agent: With this tracking device.

(He throws it to the top of the invisible house.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Granny shot! I would retreat to a safe distance if I were you.

(He throws down a smoke bomb, disappearing in the smoke.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Smoke bomb. (echo)

(Mordecai and Rigby cough as the smoke clears. The agent floors his van away.)

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta get that tracking device.

Rigby: Way ahead of ya!

(Rigby grabs pebbles from the ground and starts throwing them at the device, but they hit against the wall and window. Rigby grunts)

Mordecai: Rigby, stop! We just have to get inside and get up there.

Rigby: No, I got it!

(He puts up the ladder and tries to reach it.)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: I got it!

(He gets the pressure washer and tries to hose the device off.)

Mordecai: Dude, just do what I'm saying!

Rigby: No! I can do it myself! I can be a solo bro!

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

(Rigby sighs and stops.)

Rigby: We were supposed to do this together. Like we always do.

Mordecai: Then why did you say I could leave?

Rigby: 'Cause you got your whole "CJ" thing, and I wanted to help. It just kind of feels like we don't hang out like we used to.

Mordecai: Look, sometimes I'm gonna be doing other things. But you're my best friend. I'm not ditchin you, dude.

(Rigby smiles, then looks in front.)

Rigby: We're gonna die!

Mordecai: We gotta get inside the house!

(They get inside and start going up.)

Mordecai: Dude, it's the stairs!

(They run across until they hit a wall.)

Rigby: It's the end of the hall!

Mordecai: That means the attic's right above us!

(He reaches for the cord.)

Mordecai (continued): Where's the cord?

(He grabs it.)

Mordecai (continued): Got it!

(He pulls it and something crashes.)

Rigby: What was that?

Mordecai: I don't know, Rigby. Maybe it's the broken attic ladder you said you'd fix last week.

Rigby: Quit living in the past, man!

(The jets are heading toward the house.)

Pilot: Approaching target.

Mordecai: Come on. I'll boost you up.

Rigby: I don't know my way around the attic!

Mordecai: What, are you gonna boost me up there? Just listen to me and I'll guide you.

Rigby: Fine!

(Mordecai gets him into the attic.)

Rigby (continued): Now what?

(Mordecai points to the left.)

Mordecai: The window's that way! 

(Rigby starts running.)

Mordecai (continued): Watch out for the mirror! Left! Right! Turntable! Bird cage! Low-hanging beam! Mousetrap! Cobwebs! Close your mouth! Exposed wire! The window's in front of you!

(Rigby opens it and climbs out. Benson drives to the house eating popcorn.)

Benson: Ah. This buttered popcorn is good.

(He looks up.)

Benson (continued): Huh?

(As he stops the car, he notices Rigby running toward the tracking device.)

Benson (continued): Hey! Get down from there! It's not safe!

 (Rigby finally reaches the device as the jets get closer.)

Pilot: Target in sight.

(The missile is being aimed at Rigby and the tracking device.)

Mordecai: Rigby, throw it!

Rigby: Where?!

Mordecai: As far as you can, dude!

(Rigby runs and throws the device out the invisible window.)

Mordecai and Rigby: We did it!

Muscle Man: Bros!

(They look down and see that Muscle Man has caught the device, and is wearing the pullover.)

Muscle Man (continued): How much do you think I can get for this thing? $50? $60? How about this sweet pullover I found in the trash?

(Mordecai and Rigby signal and scream for Muscle Man to get rid of the device. He takes a look at it.)

Muscle Man (continued): "Missile Tracking Device".

(He squeals and throws it back up.)

Rigby: No, not back to us!

(Rigby throws it toward Benson, who throws it to Muscle Man, who throws it to Hi Five Ghost. Everyone keeps throwing until Benson fumbles with it.)

Benson: No, no, no, no!

(He then accidentally throws it into his closed car window.)

Benson (continued): No, no, no, no!

(He is unable to reach the device through the smashed car window. He tries the door handle.)

Benson (continued): C'mon! Open!

(The butter from his hands get stuck on the handle.)

Benson (continued): Aaah! Why did I get extra butter? C'mon!!

(He tries pulling up the door lock, but his buttery fingers make it hard.)

Benson: Darn it!

(Benson drops his keys and fumbles around grabbing them as the pilot aims the missile.)

Pilot: Lock and load.

(He presses a button and a missile comes out from underneath the jet. It then speeds toward the car. Benson screams and runs as the missile blows up his car. After a brief explosion, Mordecai and Rigby cough and go toward Benson, who is overall tempered.)

Mordecai: Oh, man! Your car.

Benson: Car?! What car? I don't see any car! Maybe it's invisible, kind of like the checks I'll be paying you with FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS!!!!!

(Turns around and sees the house still invisible)

Benson (continued): AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE?!! 

Mordecai: Yeah, about that...

(End of Paint Job)

(The episode began at the dome-sealed Park. Benson was walking with a clipboard in his hand.)

Benson: Need to get the carousel winterized. Also check into- -

(Then he bumped into a brown haired female scientist, Pam.)

Benson: Oh! Sorry about that.

Pam: No, I'm sorry. I just got so caught up in my work.

Benson: Me too. (picks up his and Pam's clipboard) Hey, wait a sec. I have the exact same (looks at Pam) clip... board...

Pam: (takes her clipboard back) You're Benson.

Benson: How'd you know?

Pam: I've been watching you. Er, not in a-a creepy stalker way. It's my job.

Benson: Right...

(It was an awkward pause for a split second before Pam spoke up again.)

Pam: So... how's that fax working out?

Benson: Oh. It's okay.

Pam: Well, I think it's really cool.

Benson: Yeah, I get a lot of important messages from Langer and the dome big wigs. And in an emergency, got the old speed dial here. If you hear this baby ringing- - (accidentally knocks Pam's protein bar out of her hand) Oh, geez! I am so sorry!

Pam: (picks up her protein bar) Oh, no worries. It's just one of Langer's terrible protein bars. He only allows "sanctioned food" in the dome-itory. What I wouldn't give for some hot wings.

Benson: Wait... you like hot wings?

Pam: Uh, yeah! It's literally my favorite food.

Benson: Me too! (flirty) Well, maybe I'll just have to swing by at your lab and drop some off.

Pam: Oh yeah? Heh, you're gonna sneak past the guards?

Benson: Maybe I will.

Pam: Well, if you do that, then you'll be my favorite person ever.

(They shared their first laugh together before Pam's pager beeped on her clipboard, showing Langer on her pager.)

Pam: Oh geez. Langer. I got to go.

Benson: Oh yeah.

Pam: (starts to walk away) Sorry. It was nice. (whispers) By the way, it's Pam.

Benson: What?

Pam: (runs off; shouts) My name is Pa-a-a-a-a-am!

(A short silence occurred until Benson broke it with a dreamy sigh, for he was now in love.)

Benson: (dreamy sigh) Pam...

Rigby: (singsong voice) Ben-son?

Benson: (turns around) Wha?

Rigby: (he and Mordecai walk towards Benson; eating popcorn) Dude, what's wrong with your face?

Mordecai: He's glowing. I've never seen him like this before.

Rigby: Yeah. It's weird.

Benson: I just met the most amazing girl. We had a real chemistry~!

Rigby: Gross! Benson, I'm trying to eat here!

Benson: Eat? (suddenly remembers) The wings! I gotta get her wings! How can I ask her out if I don't have any wings?!

(He ran to the cart, hopped in and drove off, leaving Mordecai and Rigby behind.)

Mordecai: Wait Benson, that's our stuff!

Rigby: Wanna go to the spot?

Mordecai: (with a goofy grin) Yeah I do!

(With that, they went over to "the spot" as they laughed goofily along the way. Meanwhile, at Wing Kingdom, Benson was trying to figure out what kind of wings to order for him and Pam, while a long line was behind him, annoyed with Benson for taking too long.)

Benson: Hmm... hmm, mmm, mmm... what would Pam want? Regular?

Wing Kingdom Cashier: One order of re- -

Benson: No wait, spicy.

Wing Kingdom Cashier: One order- -

Benson: What if she doesn't like spicy? I'll take half spicy.

Woman: (annoyed) They're just wings, buddy.

Benson: (turns around; triggered) "Just wings?" These wings might decide whether or not I get to go out with the girl of my dreams! (turns red) Everything has to be perfect!

Child: Mommy, I'm scared.

Wing Kingdom Cashier: Uh sir, if you can't decide, I'd recommend the Big 50 Special. It's a bucket of 50 different kinds of wings, and it comes with a liter of ranch.

Benson: (sweating) Yeah, that actually sounds pretty good. I'll get that.

Wing Kingdom Cashier: You want those crispy or crunchy?

Benson: How crispy is "crispy?"

Everyone in line: UGH!

(The scene changed back to the park, where Benson was driving in the cart with his wings and ranch. He stopped the cart and looked through the binoculars, seeing Pam entering the second dome.)

Benson: Gotta get in there. These wings aren't getting any warmer. Hmm... (takes out a jacket from the cart) Bingo.

(So he wore the jacket and approached the second dome, his wings and his ranch stuffed inside of his jacket.)

Benson: (casually) Fellas! Mondays... am I right?

(One of the guards coughed in response.)

Benson: Anyways, got an important fax from Langer. Just gonna pop in and see what the old boss man wants. (tries to walk through)

Bald Dome Guard: (stops Benson) Not until we frisk you, sir.

Benson: Guys, it's me. Benson. Manager... of the park... this park? 

Orange-Haired Dome Guard: (shrugs)

Bald Dome Guard: Sorry, buddy, it's regulation.

Benson: (scowls for a minute) ...Cool. Cool. That's cool.

(He turned around and started to walk away a little, but he took a deep breath and came back around, trying to dash towards the second dome, only for the guards to hold him back and shove him away.)

Benson: (backs away; angrily) This is outrageous! Frisk me?! I should frisk you! This is MY park!

(He stormed away from the entrance and went around the back of the dome, hoping for another way inside.)

Benson: There's gotta be another way in here. (sees another door) Jackpot.

(Running to the door, Benson tried to open it, but he found our that it would be opened from a password.)

Benson: Oh... I see your little game, Langer. However, I happen to know that statistically, the most common passcode is... (as he presses the numbers) 1, 2 3, 4, 5.

(The camera showed that Benson only typed in five numbers in the passcode.)

Benson: Uh... 6?

(But when he pressed the number, he got shocked from the passcode, since he got it wrong.)

Benson: Aah! (groans) So, its a number game, is it? Lets play.

(So he started pressing numbers, in hopes of getting the passcode right.)

Benson: One one one one one one one! (gets electrocuted) AAH! (tries again) One one one one one one two! (gets electrocuted again) AAH, geez! (tries again) One one one one one one three- -

(This time, it seemed that the passcode short-circuited, the force knocking Benson to the ground.)

Benson: (groans) This is crazy... oh, Benson! (laughs to himself) Have some dignity.

(Then he grabbed a big rock and yelled as he bashed it on the passcode, only to get electrocuted once more. Meanwhile, Mordecai and Rigby were eating snacks on a hill that was a few feet away from the second dome before Benson stormed to them, partially charred from the electricity.)

Benson: This is MY park! I should know the stupid code! (sees Mordecai and Rigby) Whatre you two doing here?!

Mordecai: (whispers) Shhhh. Listen.

(They heard the two guards talking from the spot.)

Orange-Haired Dome Guard: Man, we shouldve just pounded him and took those wings.

Bald Dome Guard: Seriously. If I gotta eat anymore of that lousy dome-itory food, someones gettin a poundin!

Benson: What the heck?

Mordecai: The sound from the guard post bounces off of the dome, and back to this exact spot.

Rigby: Its science.

Benson: I dont think you guys should be wasting your time eavesdropping on- -

Delivery Man: Delivery for Langer.

Bald Dome Guard: Take it around back.

Delivery Man: Whats the passcode again?

Bald Done Guard: (annoyed groan) The code is Langer; L-A-N-G-E-R! Got it?

Benson: (to Mordecai and Rigby) Nice work!

(So with that, Benson ran off to the dome laughing to himself with success. After he put the code in, he was finally in the dome, but now he had to get through the room, which had many doors and an elevator.)

Benson: Uhh...

(He went inside the elevator, but the doors automatically closed before he could walk out. Then the elevator rumbled, before plummeting down as he screamed. When the elevator reached the first floor, the doors opened and Benson was seen on his knees, holding his head in discomfort.)

Benson: What the heck is this place?

(Then he got up on his feet and started looking for Pam behind a corner.)

Benson: (whispering) Pam?

(He walked into another room.)

Benson: Pam?

(There was no sign of Pam in the room, so Benson walked into another one, where there were other rooms with experiments inside. He looked in Room 206 and saw a familiar brown-haired scientist, although, unbeknownst to him, the scientist had a thicker build.)

Benson: (knocks on the door) Hey Pam!

(But when the scientist turned around, it wasnt Pam; the scientist had a green robotic eye and plenty of wrinkles on his face. Benson shouted in shock before he backed away from the door window, but then he heard the guards talking nearby.)

Orange-Haired Dome Guard: So what would you do if we actually caught someone trespassing in here?

Bald Dome Guard: Oh man, Id give them a crazy beating. Theyd be like, No, please, dont hurt me! And Id be like, I have to, its my job! (punching forward) Whomp! Whomp! Whomp!

(As they walked by, Benson was hiding in the vent before they could see him. He crawled through the vents while he was sweating, until he saw something bright through the vent grid. In another room was the security monitor room, where a dome guard was asleep on the job. Several screens showed the park guys and some of the scientists.)

Benson: (astonished) No way...!

(Something else caught his attention as he saw a certain scientist on one of the screens.)

Benson: Its Pam! Room 309.

(So then he quickly got out of the vents and ran to Room 309. In there, Pam was working on an android hand until Benson barged in the room.)

Benson: Pam!

(Pam got startled from the sudden intrusion and accidentally shot out a laser from the android hand. The laser zapped Benson, covering him in ash, before he fell back on the floor.)

Pam: (shocked) Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

(Luckily, Benson got right back up and pulled out the wings and ranch.)

Benson: I brought wings~! 

Pam: Ohh! Benson, no way!

(They went to the anti-gravity room to start their date.)

Pam: Come on.

(She took off her lab coat and laid it down on the floor, using it as a picnic blanket.)

Pam: The perfect spot for a picnic.

Benson: (walks over to Pam) It sure is. (sets wings down on lab coat) Now I wasnt sure what kind of wings you liked, so I got a little bit of everything.

Pam: (picks up a wing) Mmm... first non-dome food in three weeks. (eats her wing) Mmm~! Oh my gosh. Mmm, this is amazing! Promise to sneak me a bucket of wings everyday?

Benson: (eyes widen; love-struck) Yes. Yes, I will.

(Benson and Pam laughed.)

Benson: Oh! And I got ranch.

Pam: Uh thanks, but Im not really a fan.

Benson: (throws ranch away) Me neither. Get outta here, ranch!

Pam: Nobody likes you, ranch!

Benson: Go find a salad!

(They laughed again and they ate some more wings together, while Its Friday (Im In Love) by The Cure was playing in the montage. As they ate the wings, Pam playfully poked Bensons nose, covering it in wing sauce. She giggled and ran as Benson got up and went after her with a playful smile. Once he caught her, they looked in each others eyes, smiling, before they saw wings floating in the air, meaning that there was anti-gravity in the room. Benson and Pam floated in the air as well and ate the floating wings. Pam took two wings and threw them at Benson, who was ready to catch them in his mouth, but instead they went straight for his eyes, blinding him with wing sauce. Pam took Benson to the eye wash station and washed his eyes to get the wing sauce out. In the next scene of the montage, Benson threw two wings at Pam, catching her by surprise. Pam retaliated by throwing wings back at Benson while he blocked them. As they kept throwing wings at each other, having fun, Pam grabbed the Wing Kingdom bucket and scooped up all the wings Benson threw. Then she tossed them back to Benson, splattering him with wings and covering him with more wing sauce. A clock wipe transition occurred and the song and montage ended with Benson and Pam floating together in the air, covered in wing sauce.)

Pam: Benson, this has been the best lunch ever.

Benson: Pam... theres something I want to say. (clears his throat)

Pam: Whats that noise?

Benson: I was just clearing my throat.

Pam: (points up) No, that noise.

(The noise above was coming from a giant fan in the room, and Benson and Pam were floating towards it! They screamed and frantically tried to swim away from the fan, but they kept floating up.)

Pam: Its not working!!

Benson: Grab something!

(They went to the wall and attempted to hold on, but because of their hands covered in wing sauce, they slipped off the wall, and they continued to float towards the fan.)

Pam: BENSON!!

Benson: PAM!!

(Luckily Benson spotted a rail above the fan and grabbed onto it.)

Benson: Pam!

(Pam screamed as she floated closer to the fan, but thankfully Benson grabbed her hand and pulled her back to him.)

Benson: Oh Pam... Im so sorry for getting you into this mess. I just wanted to get you some hot wings, because... Because I really wanted to see you again.

Pam: Oh Benson, you know, my life is just work, work, work. And even though were about to die in a horrific and entirely preventable death, Im really glad I got to spend this time with you.

(They smiled, gazing at each others eyes. Then they leaned in for a kiss... until Benson belched in Pams face.)

Benson: (embarrassed) Sorry! Sorry, Im so... Wha?

(Suddenly, he noticed that he started to float down, away from the fan.)

Benson: The burp! Pam, you gotta burp!

Pam: (covers her mouth and burps quietly)

Benson: You gotta let it rip!

(So Pam burped as well before she started floating down with Benson.)

Benson: Nice!

Pam: It worked! 

(So with that, they kept belching and floating down, just like in Willy Wonka.)

Pam: (as she belches) Best lunch ever.

Benson: (as he belches) Except the fan.

(Finally they landed back on the floor.)

Benson: That was crazy!

Pam: (hugs Benson) Benson, you beautiful genius, you did it! You saved us! 

(Benson smiled with glee, until some slow clapping ruined the happy moment. The slow clapping came from Dr. Langer.)

Dr. Langer: (sarcastic) Yes Benson, youre very smart.

Benson: Langer! Did you just see that?

Dr. Langer: Oh no wait, I meant the other thing; youre very dumb! You didnt burp yourself to safety! Your ranch turned on this top secret anti-gravity machine! Look at this place!

(Benson and Pam looked at the mess they made during their date.)

Pam: (nervously) I-Im sorry, sir. We were having lunch, and it-it got out of hand.

Dr. Langer: Lunch? Lu- Like a date?

Pam: Well, um... (she and Benson blush) Yeah. Like a date.

Dr. Langer: You told me that you were too busy to date! You know what? Forget it. Im issuing a new policy effective immediately. There will be no dating test subjects in this dome!

(Benson and Pam got disappointed at this, now that they could no longer date each other.)

Dr. Langer: Both of you, report to the decontamination room, NOW!

(The next scene showed Benson being decontaminated by getting sprayed with a hose, which was held by some guy in a hazmat-like suit.)

Benson: (screams) HEY! Watch it! Not in the face!

(He got on the floor as he kept getting sprayed with the hose. The guy turned the hose off for a second, leaving Benson to cry on the floor, before he turned the hose on again, spraying Benson once more. The next scene showed Benson getting thrown out of the second dome by the guards, before they threw the jacket in his face. Benson sadly walked away from the dome, dragging his jacket along with him.)

Pam: I had a great time today. 

Benson: (sighs sadly) Me too, memory of Pam.

Pam: (chuckles) No Benson, over here.

Benson: Huh?

(He turned around and saw Pam waving at him behind the second dome.)

Pam: Check your pocket.

Benson: (checks in his jacket pocket) A wing!

Pam: I snuck one out for both of us.

Benson: Aww, no way! Pam? Can we go out when this is all over?

Pam: (chuckles) Of course, Benson.

(They took a bite of their wing, before they started laughing as Pam waved at Benson. Their laughing turned into silly guffaws while Pam slowly started to leave. When she was gone, Benson was the only one guffawing goofily, but he stopped when he heard two certain people laughing goofily as well. He turned around and saw Mordecai and Rigby sitting on the hill, laughing and eating popcorn.)

Benson: ... (turns red) GET BACK TO WORK!!

(End of Pam I Am)

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby standing in front of a burger truck)

Rigby: Aw, yeah-uh, burgers for lunch!

Mordecai: You get the portabella mushroom burger?

Rigby: You porto better believe it.

Mordecai and Rigby: Ooohhhhhh!!!!

Gimelli: Order up.

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah, yeah, yeah! (They get their burgers)

Rigby: Aw, yeah, this is gonna be good!

Mordecai: Yeah, but I feel like we're forgetting something.

Benson: MORDECAI AND RIGBY, YOU FORGOT TO FILL THAT POTHOLE! (He points at a small pothole next to the burger truck's wheel)

Mordecai: Oh, yeah, that thing. Well, see, I think we'll work better if we take a quick snack break.

Rigby: Look, we promise to do it right after.

Benson: NO! NO BURGERS! JUST FILL THE POTHOLE OR YOU'RE FIRED! (He walks away)

Mordecai: Dude, just one bite?

Rigby: There's nothing on Earth that's gonna stop me from eating this burger.

(As they are about to eat, they see an anonymous object falling out of the sky and lands near the food truck, creating a larger hole)

Mordecai: Aw, man! Now the pothole's way bigger!

(They walk towards it and see an egg shaped spacecraft in the hole)

Mordecai and Rigby: Wooooooooaaaaahhh

Mordecai: Dude, come on. (They run towards it. Mordecai touches it and it slowly opens) AH!

Mordecai and Rigby: (They both move towards the opening, but confetti shoots out) AAAHH!

(Partying music starts to play, and a passed out horse is seen with a few empty soda cans.)

Rigby: What the-AH! (The horse falls out of the spacecraft. Scene cuts to the horse slowly waking up in the house and seeing Mordecai and Rigby standing there.) Dude, he's waking up.

Party Horse 42699: What..what's going on? Who are you guys?

Mordecai: We're Mordecai and Rigby, who are you?

Party Horse 42699: I'm Party Horse, and I like to paaaaaaaarrrrrrrtay! So, hey, uh, where am I?

Mordecai: You're on Earth, dude.

Party Horse 42699: Earth?! Wait, what country is this?!

Rigby: USA, man! Land of the free, home of the brave!

Party Horse 42699: *gasps* (he looks around and sees American objects, like a small Statue of Liberty, a book with Uncle Sam on the cover that states "I Want You To Save Big, All American Carpet", and a picture on the wall of George Washington. Party Horse starts to freak out) AAHH! I REMEMBER NOW. AAHH! (He kicks the picture, causing it to fall down and break)

Mordecai: Aww, man! Benson just hung that up!

Party Horse 42699: I'm sorry! It's just, ugh, U.S. History is a touchy subject for me.

Rigby: Woah, they have U.S. History where you're from?

Party Horse 42699: Yeah, that's why I'm here in the first place....(scene cuts to Party Horse Planet) Back on Party Horse Planet, partying wasn't just a hobby, it was a way of life. (Scene then shows Party Horse 42699 partying in a club with other Party Horses. He screams "WOOOOOOHH!!") Everyone partied non stop, day and night, around the clock. It was the best, man. (Scene now shows Party Horse 42699 partying while doing daily activities, such as taking a shower, flipping food in the kitchen, and sleeping) Until, we had to go to school. (scene now shows a group of Party Horses in class, including Party Horse 42699) AAAAUUUUUGGHH! (he then plays with his mouth out of boredom) They said, like, in order to become legit Party Horses, we had to pass a U.S. History test.

Principal Party Horse: Party's over, because Professor Party Horse is out partying, I'm gonna have to give you this test.

Party Horse 42699: (Scene then shows Party Horse 42699 flipping through pages in the test) *sighs*, UUUUUUGGGHHH! (He grabs his head, then raises his hoof) Principal Party Horse?! Sir?!

Principal Party Horse: What is it, Party Horse 42699?

Party Horse 42699: Can I go to the bathroom? I promise I'll come right back, and take this test.

Principal Party Horse: Promise?

Party Horse 42699: (smiles) Promise. (scene freezes, Party Horse narrates again) And then I totally BAILED! (scene then shows Party Horse in his spacecraft, partying and drinking a soda. He finishes the soda and smashes the can with his head, then screams "WOOOOOHH!!" Scene then shows the spacecraft disappearing. Scene then cuts back to them in the Park house) Bottom line guys, if I don't pass the U.S. History test, I'll never be able to party again.

Mordecai: Woah, that's rough, dude.

Rigby: I still don't get why they have U.S. History on another planet!

Party Horse 42699: It's typical school, man. They don't even know! So, you guys think you could, like, help me study or somethin?

Mordecai: Party Horse, we'll help you pass that test, because we've always wanted to help an alien pass a U.S. History test.

Rigby: (while nodding) Yeah, ever since we saw that one movie with the alien in it.

Party Horse 42699: WOOOOHH! ALRIIIIGHT! (starts partying)

(scene now cuts to the three of them on the computer in the house)

Mordecai: Ok....what's a good history topic?

Rigby: Um.......presidents!

Mordecai: Ah, good one. (typing) Preeesiiident

Party Horse 42699: (also typing) ....ooof parrrtyyying

Mordecai: I don't think that's a real topic, Party Horse.

Party Horse 42699: No, no, just give it a second. (scene shows computer screen turn into a distracting page with icons partying, including a baby) Woah! That dancing baby knows how to party! (starts partying)

Mordecai: (looks at Rigby) Uh, maybe the Internet's too distracting.

(Scene then cuts to the Library, and the three walk in)

Mordecai: Ok, let's find the history section.

Party Horse 42699: (notices a librarian using a scanner and scanning books. He runs over to him)

Mordecai: (notices Party Horse running off) Huh?

Party Horse 42699: (grabs the scanner and flashes it around and starts to party again) Nts, nts, nts, nts, AH, AH, nts, nts, nts!

Rigby: I'd never thought I'd say this, but maybe the Library is too distracting.

(scene now cuts to an open field. Party Horse looks around, getting bored. He sees a tumbleweed fly by)

Party Horse 42699: Um, guys, *sighs* I'm worried it's gonna be really hard to throw a party out here, 'cause it's so boring.

Mordecai: (seriously) That's the idea, Party Horse. Now, let's study already.

Rigby: (also serious) Yeah, you're the one who asked us for help. (Both drop books at Party Horse's hooves)

Party Horse 42699: (takes one of the books and opens it. He looks at it, then starts complaining, while frantically flipping the pages) UUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHAAAAAAGGGGHH! (slams book closed) LOOK. Guys. I'm gonna be real with you. I appreciate what you're doing, but I think I'll study better, if I just take a quick snack break.

Mordecai: (frustrated) Oh, come on! That's the lamest excuse in the book, Party Horse!

Rigby: (frustrated) Yeah, I don't even use that one anymore very often!

Party Horse 42699: Look, (puts one hoof over heart and the other in the air) I promise that if we go eat something, I'll study right after......right after.

Mordecai: (skeptically) You promise?

Party Horse 42699: (seriously) Promise.

(scene then cuts to the three of them on the couch in the Park house playing video games and eating grilled cheese sandwiches)

Party Horse 42699: WOH! Now this is a snack break!

Mordecai: Ok, we're done, now we gotta study.

Party Horse 42699: (complaining) AWWW COME ON, just ONE more round!

Mordecai: (frustrated) NO! No more distractions Party Horse!

Rigby: (frustrated) Yeah, nothing on Earth is gonna keep you from studying for that test!

(At that moment, another spacecraft can be heard crash landing out side of the house, which causes some shaking. The three go to the window and look outside. They see another giant hole created outside of the house, with the spacecraft peaking out)

Rigby: Man, I've gotta stop saying that!

Party Horse 42699: (nervously) He found me. I don't know how, but he found me!

Mordecai: What?! Who found you?

(The spacecraft is now slowly opening, and Principal Party Horse steps out)

Party Horse 42699: Principal Party Horse......

Principal Party Horse: (walks out of the hole, carrying an air horn. He takes off his sunglasses and speaks into it) Party Horse! I know you're in there. Come out right now and take that U.S. History test.

Party Horse 42699: I'll take it when I want, which is never old man! (blows party whistle)

Principal Party Horse: If you don't come out and take that test right now, I'm gonna blow up the Earth with this detonator! (pulls out the detonator, its starts beeping) 

Mordecai: WOAH, WHAT?!

Rigby: (to Party Horse) Can he do that?!

Party Horse 42699: ......yeah...

Principal Party Horse: Now if you don't come out on the count of three, your party is gonna end with a BANG! 1.....

Mordecai, Rigby, and Party Horse 42699: UuuuuUUUUUUUHH......(Principal Party Horse can be heard in the back ground still counting, ".....2.........2 1/2.....") (Mordecai then kicks the front door open and stops Principal Party Horse)

Mordecai: WAIT! Party Horse just isn't ready yet! He needs more time to study!

Principal Party Horse: He's had plenty of time!

Mordecai: Yeah, but it's not his fault! We distracted him by getting him to play video games with us!

Rigby: Yeah, that's it! Video games! Can't get enough of 'em here on Earth!

Mordecai: Look, just give him one hour to study. Please.

Principal Party Horse: Alright, fine. One hour. But if he fails the U.S. History test, you'll ALL be history! (puts sunglasses back on and stand on hind legs) BWAHAHAHAHAHA! *soft neigh* (he gallops away)

Party Horse 42699: Aw man, thanks so much you guys.

Mordecai: (seriously) Listen Party Horse, partying's cool and all, but now the whole Earth's on the line.

Rigby: (seriously) You have GOT to study man!

Party Horse 42699: No problemo, bros! (seriously) I promise I'm gonna cram harder than I've ever crammed so I can pass that test to keep your planet from blowing up.

(Back in the house Party Horse flips a mixtape in a radio from "Party Mix" to "Teaching Montage Party Horse". A montage then starts in which Party Horse begins to study. In the kitchen, Mordecai and Rigby hand Party Horse a book. When he finishes reading it, they give him another book. Next Mordecai tells him about George Washington and Rigby shows the same picture from before. Out of instinct, Party Horse kicks it again. Then Party Horse reads about The Boston Tea Party, George Washington crossing to New Jersey, the Indians, the Statue of Liberty, the first trip to the moon in the 60's, Rosie the Riveter, the Heimlich blimp crashing, the Gothic painting, sailors coming home from WWII, the Dwight D. Eisenhower election, the Vietnam war, and Abraham Lincoln giving the Gettysburg Address. Finally Party Horse closes the book and Mordecai and Rigby pat his back and nod. Lastly, Mount Rushmore is shown with Party Horse, Mordecai, Rigby, and Abraham Lincoln. Scene then cuts to the Parkside Lux Ballroom. Party Horse is sitting at a desk and Principal Party Horse gives him his test)

Principal Party Horse: The U.S. History test consists of one hundred multiple choice questions. Fill in each circle completely with a number two pencil. You have one hour, and since I expect you to fail, I'm going to make an example of you, (a camera is seen, scene cuts to the classroom at Party Horse Planet. There is a room full of Party Horses watching) so all the Party Horses back home will see what happens when you party without a proper grasp of U.S. History (a different Party Horse is seen taking Party Horse 42699's spot. Scene is back at Parkside Lux). Good luck, Party Horse. The fate of this Earth rests in your hooves. (walks away and sits at a table. Party Horse looks nervously at the test. Principal Party Horse sets a timer) Begin!

Party Horse 42699: (begins the test, starts to fill out the scantron sheet, question by question. He nods at some of them)

Rigby: Hmm, hmm! He's got this. (At that moment, Benson shows up)

Benson: (frustrated) What's going on here? Did you finish filling the pothole? (Notices Party Horse) Why is there a horse taking a tes-MPH! (Mordecai puts his wing over Benson's mouth to shut him up. Then, he takes it of and explains the situation)

Mordecai: Look Benson, I know we normally don't have very good excuses for why we don't do stuff, but we definitely have a good one this time. (points at Party Horse) That horse right there, (stops pointing) fell out of the sky and has to pass a U.S. History test or the whole Earth is gonna explode.

Benson: WHAT?!

Principal Party Horse: SHH! Test taking IN PROGRESS! (some music starts to play and a small montage takes place. Party Horse fills in question after question, until the graphite on his pencil snaps)

Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson: *GASP*

Principal Party Horse: OOOoooh, looks like you've been lead astray. HAHAHAHA!

Party Horse 42699: (looks down, feeling defeated)

Principal Party Horse: (watches Party Horse, has hoof on the button on the detonator) hehehehe.....

Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson: (panicking) uuuuhhh, UUUUHHHHHH, UUUUUHHHH!!!!!

Rigby: (notices a pencil sharpener on the wall across the room) Look! (he starts to run towards it, but Principal Party Horse blocks his way)

Principal Party Horse: *NEIGH* (Rigby runs around him and pulls the sharpener out of the wall, making a hole in the wall)

Benson: (angry) Aw come on! I JUST put that up!! (Rigby tries to run back, but Principal Party Horse is running towards him)

Rigby: PARTY HORSE, CATCH! (he throws it towards Party Horse and over Principal Party Horse)

Principal Party Horse: (in slow motion) NOOOOOOO! I DON'T WANT PARTY HORSE TO SUCCEEEEED! (Party Horse catches it)

Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson: *happy gasp*

Principal Party Horse: GRRRRR!

Party Horse 42699: (begins to sharpen his pencil, then finishes the last couple of questions. The timer rings)

Principal Party Horse: Pencils down!...Well, well, well, you're friends may have lead a horse do a U.S. History test, but let's see if they made him think. Now, give me that test.

Party Horse 42699: (gets up and walks the test over to Principal Party Horse. Before giving it to him however, Party Horse talks to him) Principal Party Horse, I may have failed this test, but if I've learned one thing, it's that partying is an important part of U.S. History.

Principal Party Horse: (raises eyebrow) Go on...

Party Horse 42699: (patriotic music starts to play) Well, sir, it's a known fact that the biggest events in U.S. History were all about parties. The Boston Tea Party, the Two Party System, the other stuff that America has with parties. Think about it, man! Look, I know I haven't been the best student, in the past, and you've been following me for a long time, and you've blown up a lot of planets because of me. But I'm done running away from my problems. (Scene shows Mordecai, Rigby and Benson) Don't blame these guys for the stuff I did. They did their best to help me and it's not their fault that I am a non stop partying machine. That's on me! It's time I take responsibility for my actions, so please, no matter how I do on this test, promise me, you won't blow up the Earth.

Principal Party Horse: (slowly claps) (patriotic music then stops) Responsibility! I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that, Party Horse. It's settled then. I promise not to blow up the Earth, no matter how you did on this test.

Party Horse 42699: (smiles and hands the test over)

Principal Party Horse: Alright, I'll just take a look here and-(it's then revealed that Party Horse drew a picture of Principal Party Horse looking dumb and filled out the bubbles to spell out "Jerk Horse" instead of actually taking the test) (frustrated) WHAT?!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hahahahaha!

Mordecai: (mocking voice) Jerkhorse!

Party Horse 42699: PSYCH! No one's EVER gonna stop this Party Horse! (does some flips and dances) Nts, nts, nts, nts, AH, AH, nts, nts, nts, nts! (moonwalks to the door)

Other Party Horses: (cheering) 4-2-6-9-9! 4-2-6-9-9!

Party Horse 42699: (continues to moonwalk all the way to his spacecraft) (almost inaudible) Ah, ah, I'm like the top, of...(backflips into spacecraft) HUP! (before closing the craft, he blows a party whistle) Party Horse, AAAAAAOOUUUUUUUTT! (his spacecraft then leaves)

Principal Party Horse: NOOOOOOO, PARTY HORSE! I never should've promised that I wouldn't blow up the Earth regardless of the outcome of YOOOOOUUUUR TEESSSTTT! (he runs to his spacecraft and follows Party Horse. Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson stand at the entrance of the doorway for a moment)

Benson: Just please fill up the pothole.

(End of "Party Horse")

(Mordecai and Rigby are cleaning out the attic in the House. Rigby is chasing a moth with a feather duster, trying to swat it)

Mordecai: Dude. Quit messing around and give me a hand with these boxes.

Rigby: I'm busy.

(Rigby swipes at the moth but misses, hitting an old box covered with a tarp. Dust clouds fly into the air as Rigby coughs.)

Rigby: Huh? (The tarp falls off the box, uncovering a mini-fridge filled with soda. He gasps.)

Mordecai: What? What is it?

(Rigby stares open-mouthed at the contents of the box.)

Mordecai: (gasps) RadiCola!

Rigby: Aw, man, this stuff was the best!

Mordecai: Whoa! This is from the 1984 Olympics. Dude, let's go take these out back and drink 'em all.

Skips: (from downstairs) Come on.

(Skips' voice is coming from an air vent, which Mordecai and Rigby approach)

Benson: Skips, we have a lot- we have a lot to do. I need to be around-

(Mordecai and Rigby watch Skips and Benson in the hallway through the air vent on the ceiling)

Skips: No, you should think it over, I'm telling you.

Benson: I don't know, Skips.

Skips: Seriously, Benson, you work too hard. You should take the night off.

Benson: Well... if you say so. But if anything happens-

Skips: Stop your worrying. Everything will be fine.

Benson: Okay.

Mordecai: Benson gone...

Rigby: ... plus soda...

Mordecai: ... equals...

Mordecai and Rigby: Party! Ohhhhh!

(We cut to the Computer Room. Mordecai is using the computer as Rigby watches. They are on a social networking site)

Rigby: Him, him, her, himwhoa, definitely invite her.

(Muscle Man enters the computer room with Hi Five Ghost just behind)

Muscle Man: Hey, jerk-weeds. Get off the computer. I got sign-up time. You know how long my downloads take.

Rigby: We're busy inviting people to our party.

Muscle Man: What? Your parties suck. I was at the last one, and there weren't even any chicks.

Mordecai: Yeah, well, just you wait. This party's gonna be awesome.

Muscle Man: I highly doubt it. (High-fives Hi Five Ghost)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm, hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

(We cut to the Kitchen. Mordecai and Rigby are unpacking sacks of groceries)

Mordecai and Rigby: We gonna paaaaar-ty!

Mordecai: Got some chips, got some dips!

Rigby: (rapping) Some call me cheap, bit of a freeloader, but I bought cups for that old-school soda!

Mordecai: (rapping) I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast, but here's some hummus for these mini-toasts!

Rigby: Huu-mmus!

Mordecai: Humm-uus!!

Mordecai and Rigby: (chanting) Hummus!

Benson: Why are you guys yelling hummus?

(Benson and Skips enter via the back door as Mordecai and Rigby try to hide their party supplies)

Mordecai: Uh, no reason.

Benson: Doesn't matter anyway, 'cause while I'm on my night off tonight, Skips is in charge. That's right. This guy is gonna be my eyes and ears.

(Skips nods approvingly as Benson strides and whistles his way to the back door and outside)

Skips: This better be some party.

(We cut to the living room. Skips is on the couch looking bored. Next to him is Pops, asleep)

Rigby: Man, this party is off the hook! 'Cause we got sod-aaaaa in the house!

(Skips snatches a can of RadiCola from Rigby)

Skips: What? 1984 Olympics? Are you sure we can drink this?

Rigby: Sure you can. It's aged to perfection.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost enter)

Muscle Man: Ha ha ha, ha ha ha! Told you this party was gonna blow.

(The doorbell rings and three human guests enter, two male, one female)

Guest 1: I think this is the place... Oh, sorry. We thought there was a party here. (The new guests turn and leave)

Muscle Man: Ohhhhh! I told you, I told you! Your party is lame! Ha ha ha ha ha!

(Mordecai and Rigby go into the kitchen)

Mordecai: Dude, This party is tanking fast. There's gotta be a way to step this up. (Mordecai hits the TV and it switches on. We hear a German voiceover artist speaking over a commercial showing four bored party guests sitting on a couch. It transpires that this is "Party Pete")

Party Pete: Ist your party tanking fast? Vell, I've got the answer.

(On screen, Party Pete slides into view, accompanied by two beautiful women. The four party guests on the couch stand up in shock and a fifth appears next to them)

Party Guests: Party Pete! (The Party Pete logo slides onto the screen as a robot voice says Party Pete. The screen cuts to a rocking party, with dozens of guests dancing under the disco ball in the same apartment as the lame party)

Party Pete Guest: Awesome party, bro.

Party Pete: Ist your party not hardy? Call me. (We see Party Pete reclining on a massive ice sculpture of himself outside) Act now and get ze free promotional ice sculpture. Vat ist you vaiting for? (The robot voice says Party Pete again as the message 'Party Pete, $50/hr, Call Now, 555-0177 flashes on screen)

Mordecai: (Back in the kitchen) Aw, man. We need that guy.

Rigby: What? Why would you want to pay fifty dollars for some dude to come to our house? What's he even gonna do? He's just gonna come and eat all our food.

Mordecai: Do you have a better idea?

Rigby: Yes, I do.

(Back in the living room, Rigby puts a cassette in the tape deck and starts dancing)

Rigby: Yay-uh! Yay-uh! Yay-uh! Yeaaaaah!!! (Rigby dances and shouts along to the terrible, discordant music. Mordecai covers his ears) Woo! Come on, Skips! Dance!

Skips: (Slaps away Rigby's hand) Don't touch me!

Pops: Oh, it hurts to listen!

(The tape player begins to overheat, then spits out the cassette's tape and stops playing. Muscle Man whistles like a bomb dropping, then makes a fart sound)

Muscle Man: Hear that? That's the sound of your party failing! Dance to that, losers! Ha ha ha ha ha!

(Cuts to outside Benson's apartment. Benson is wearing a robe and leaning out of his bathroom window)

Benson: Just relax, Benson. Everything's gonna be fine, Benson. Skips has got this. Yeah.

(Inside, soothing music plays as Benson removes his robe and gets into a full bathtub surrounded by candles)

Benson: Ahhhhh... You deserve this, Benson. Yes. Yes, I do.

(Back at the park house, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Skips, and Pops are on the couch watching TV)

Man on TV: ... and slowly decapitates him. (The sound of a sword slashing is heard as a hand on screen points to a jar with a tiny fly in it) And that was the mating of the Toledo horsefly, narrated by me... (Mordecai watches in horror from the kitchen)

Mordecai: (To Rigby, in the kitchen) This party's hit rock bottom, dude. Muscle Man was right. (Mordecai walks to the phone and begins to dial)

Rigby: What are you doing?

Mordecai: Calling Party Pete.

(Mordecai dials 555-0177 on the kitchen wall phone)

Party Pete: (clears throat) Mm, ja, ja, Party Pete.

Mordecai: Party Pete?

(Back in the living room)

Skips: Alright, let's get outta here.

(Skips, Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi Five Ghost make to leave. Mordecai and Rigby chase after them)

Mordecai: Whoa! Whoa! Where's everybody going?

Skips: We've had enough. We're gonna head out.

Muscle Man: Yeah, losers. Takes more than expired soda to have a party. It takes guests with breasts, and mine don't count.

Mordecai: Guys, people are coming. They're just fashionably late.

Skips: (checks watch) It's ten thirty. Nobody else is gonna come.

(The doorbell rings)

Mordecai: (nervously) I wonder who that could be, ha ha...

(Mordecai and Rigby walk to the front door)

Mordecai: Quick, how much money you got?

Rigby: Three dollars.

Mordecai: I've got five.

(Mordecai and Rigby open the door to find Party Pete hip-thrusting, with one the attractive women from the commercial on each arm. Bass-heavy dance music plays)

Party Pete: Ya have ze fifty dollars?

Mordecai: Huh! Great, you're here. How much partying will this buy?

Party Pete: Eight bucks? About ten minutes.

Mordecai: That's perfect! That's all we need to get the party started again.

Party Pete: Okay, ve'll do it. Chrissy, Janet, Get zem ze eight dollar version of ze promotional ice sculpture.

(Chrissy and Janet, the hot women, walk off the porch and return with a life-sized ice sculpture of a urinal, which they take inside)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa... Cool...

(Back inside, Party Pete emerges from the hallway into the living room in a party pose)

Party Pete: Hey, everybody! Ready to party?

(Party Pete removes Rigby's broken cassette from the player and replaces it with his own, hitting play. Electronic dance music plays as Party Pete dances. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are amazed by Party Pete's dancing skills. Janet and Chrissy dance and grind next to Pops and Skips, who couldn't be happier. Pops starts dancing as well, and we see a montage of increasingly crazy party photos, before the scene ends with Mordecai and Rigby taunting Muscle Man back in the living room)

Mordecai: (In something of an Australian accent) Aw, yeah! In yo' face, Muscle Man!

Rigby: (In the same accent) Yeah! In your face!

(Party Pete stops the cassette then points to his watch)

Party Pete: OK, ten minutes are up, ve're going to go.

Muscle Man: Aw yeah! This party's lame... again!

(Party Pete, Janet, and Chrissy begin to leave. Mordecai spots a crate of RadiCola next to the couch)

Mordecai: Party Pete! Can't you stick around for one soda? (offers Party Pete a can of RadiCola)

Party Pete: Whoa, I remember zis stuff. I suppose one couldn't hurt. (Party Pete cracks the soda open and takes a sip) Mmm, yeah. You keep zese coming und I keep ze party going.

(Bass heavy music resumes as Party Pete downs the can and crushes it with a manic look in his eye)

Skips: No good can come of this.

(Outside we see around 20 guests approaching the house. Guest 1 from earlier is the first to enter the house and living room.)

Guest 1: I knew we'd find the party!

(Party Pete is now guzzling another can of soda as everyone cheers)

Party Pete: Party Pete in de hooooouuse!

(Dozens of guests have assembled in the house and are dancing wildly)

Mordecai and Rigby: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

(Party Pete runs from female guest to female guest, kissing one of them on the cheek and blowing their hair)

Rigby: Dude! This party is insane!

Mordecai: I know! The centaurs even showed up!

(One of the centaurs backs into the frozen urinal)

Centaur 1: Huh? What the? Suck on this, promotional ice sculpture!

(Centaur 1 pours a soda into the urinal, crushes a can in it, then throws it out the window)

Mordecai: Ha, ha! We did it, dude! Whoa. Check that out.

(Muscle Man is dancing with a beautiful, tall, dark-haired woman. He sees Mordecai and Rigby watching him have a good time and pauses, crossing his arms)

Mordecai: Having a good time, Muscle Man?

(A male guest, whose jacket is on fire, approaches Mordecai and Rigby)

Guest on fire: Hey, wassup, Mordy and Rigbird? You remember how your toilet like used to flush, an' also like how it used to not be on fire? Anyway, phone call for ya. Some angry dude named Benson. Later.

Mordecai: (nervously) Heh... hello?

Benson: (In a robe in his apartment, talking into the phone and standing by the window) Is that a party I hear?

Mordecai: Uh, no, that's the TV.

Benson: Oh, yeah? (angrily) I can hear music coming from the house! (He looks at the house, glowing from the party, from his window) I think I'm gonna come down for a little visit. See ya soon!

Mordecai: (Hears the phone hang up and the dial tone, then speaks to Rigby) Uhh... dude, Benson is coming. We gotta find Party Pete, fast.

(A huge yellow glow is seen in front of a huge group of revelers. Mordecai and Rigby try to fight their way through)

Mordecai and Rigby: Party Pete! Party Pete!

(They make it through to the front and see Party Pete glowing and dancing wildly, with several empty soda cans all over the floor. Mordecai picks one up)

Mordecai: Ugh, Party Pete? How many of these have you had?

Rigby: Seriously, man! You gotta stop!

(Rigby tries to grab Party Pete's arm but the glow shocks him backwards as he yelps in pain. Party Pete stops dancing and turns to face them, his eyes nothing but white fire)

Party Pete: Stop? I do not vant to.

(Party Pete levitates into the air and emits a flash of green light that illuminates the sky outside through the window. He expands into a sphere and becomes a human disco ball, spinning and glowing)

Mordecai: Dude, he's unstoppable!

Skips: (Enters with Pops, and carries a crate of soda) Not for long. If we give him more soda, he'll grow brighter and brighter until he exhausts all his energy. Then he'll burn out like a star.

(The four grab soda cans)

Mordecai: Come on. Let's do this.

(The four throw their soda cans at Party Pete, who stretches out his arms and stops them in mid-air. They open by themselves and the contents fly into his mouth. His face expands to hideous proportions)

Mordecai: It's working! Quick, we need more soda!

Skips: We're all out.

Mordecai: Wait. I know where there's more soda.

(The four rush outside and back in, carrying the frozen urinal, which has some soda in it)

Mordecai: Alright everybody, on three. One, two, three!

(They throw the urinal at Party Pete. It melts, and the ice water and soda fly into his mouth. The music hits a high tempo as Party Pete looks ready to explode)

Random Guest: Dude! Party Pete's gonna blow!

Mordecai: Hit the deck!

(Skips grabs Pops and jumps behind an upturned table, Mordecai and Rigby leap behind the couch, and the guests all scatter out of the house as Party Pete screams and finally explodes in a flash of white light. When Mordecai and Rigby emerge from behind the couch, the lighting is back to normal but the living room is completely wrecked, and the upstairs toilet has fallen through the ceiling)

Mordecai: We're dead. This place is completely trashed. We'll never get this place cleaned up before Benson comes back.

Rigby: It could be worse.

(The toilet spontaneously catches fire)

Rigby: That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

(The centaurs walk up to Mordecai and Rigby)

Centaur Leader: Yo, that party was awesome! We'll totally help you clean up.

(Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost also appear)

Pops: And we're here to help, too!

(A montage follows of everyone cleaning the entire house in record time. Janet and Chrissy get into the Party Pete van and drive off just as Benson's car comes over the hill. Benson is driving and looks furious. Rigby spots him from the window)

Rigby: Oh, man! Benson's coming!

Mordecai: Everybody out through the kitchen!

(The centaurs and park workers, except for Mordecai and Rigby, all run through the living room)

Unidentified Centaur: Wicked party, duders!

Pops: Capital soiree!

Muscle Man: (Carrying an armful of trash) I guess I was wrong. That party was kinda awesome. I'm gonna go collapse in my bathtub now.

(Benson's car comes to a halt just outside. Without even shutting off the engine, he sprints up the front steps and into the house, running into the living room, where he sees Mordecai and Rigby playing video games in a spotless environment)

Benson: You guys are dead. I knew I couldn't trust yo... (Pans out to Mordecai and Rigby) What the...?

Rigby: Oh, hey Benson. What's up?

Benson: What are you guys doing?

Mordecai: We're just playing video games.

Benson: Hmmm...

(Benson runs from room to room to inspect them for a hidden party or damage)

Benson: Whoa-ho! You guys are clean! Sorry for doubting you.

(Mordecai and Rigby make 'aw shucks' noises)

Benson: I wanna do something nice for you two.

(Mordecai and Rigby make 'aw shucks' noises again)

Benson: Yep, you guys of all people would appreciate this. I've been saving some soda from the 1984 Olympics for a special occasion.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan)

Mordecai: Uh, wait what?

Benson: So let's crack open some cold ones! They're up in the attic, come on!

(Benson marches upstairs as Mordecai and Rigby stand up in the living room)

Mordecai: We're dead.

(Scene opens at Pops's House. There is a party, and everyone is dancing. Thomas is the DJ, and Benson is dancing with Audrey.)

Audrey: Wow, Benson! You can really dance.

Benson: Ha! I'm just getting warmed up!

(Benson unties Audrey's bandana and ties it around his own forehead. He then proceeds to dance with her.)

Mordecai: Whoa! He's getting loose!

Rigby: I didn't know he had it in him.

(Skips skips over to Mordecai and Rigby)

Skips: Yeah, Benson finally asked out Audrey on a date, and she said yes.

Mordecai: Oh, that explains it.

Rigby: We should get him to ask Audrey out more often.

(Benson is hopping around excitedly)

Muscle Man: Benson, you're going off! Bow to the party king!

Crowd: Benson! Benson! Benson! Benson! Benson! Benson!

(Two men in suits take pictures of Benson.)

(We skip to the next day. Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Muscle Man, and High Five Ghost are sitting on the steps, waiting for Benson to arrive. Remnants of the party from the night before are scattered all over the lawn.)

Skips: (Glances at his watch) It's a quarter-past nine. Benson's never late.

Mordecai: Cut him some slack, he was literally partying all night.

Muscle Man: Unlike someone I found face-down in the nachos. 

High Five Ghost: (Embarrassed) Dude!

(Muscle Man laughs until Pops comes through the front door)

Pops: Guys, come quick!

(The guys run inside and see a commercial on T.V. The advertisement is similar to the commercial in Party Pete.)

Voice: Is your party just not getting started?

(Benson pops up with a couple of ladies)

Party People: Party Benson!

(The words PARTY BENSON appear, along with a robotic-sounding voice that announces his name)

Guy: Awesome party, man.

Party Benson: (Looking toward the camera) I know. Don't wait! (Number appears on screen) Call Party Starters and ask for Party Benson!

Logo Voice: Party Benson!

(The guys are shocked)

Pops: Oh, my!

Skips: Something real strange is going on. We better go check up on him.

(Cut to Benson's Apartment. The guys are heading to his room.)

Mordecai: (Starts knocking on Benson's door) Benson? (Door opens) Huh? Benson? Are you home?

(The place looks deserted)

Rigby: Benson?

Pops: Oh, no!

Skips: He's not here!

Mordecai: Wait, what's that?

Rigby: (Picks something up off the floor) It looks like one of those paper tongue-looking party favors or whatever they're called.

Mordecai: (Gasps) Dude! Don't you remember what Benson told us?

(Flashback)

(Mordecai and Rigby are obnoxiously blowing into paper tongue party favors. They continue to do so, acting as if they are having a conversation. The camera zooms out as the duo laughs, which also reveals a pile of leaves they forgot about raking. Benson walks over with a clipboard, looking annoyed.)

Benson: Hey, what did I tell you about those paper tongue party favor things or whatever they're called? I hate having those things anywhere near me. If you ever see one in my house, you should probably assume I've been kidnapped or something!

(The flashback ends. Everybody is heard gasping in remembrance.) 

Skips: Yeah! (He points at the party favor) Let me see that thing.

(Mordecai hands him the paper tongue party favor. Skips unravels it, revealing the name of the company that made it. He notices that it belongs to the same company that sent Party Benson.)

Skips (continued): Huh. Looks like we should pay these guys a visit.

(We skip to later in the day.The park groundskeepers are standing outside the entrance of the main building of the Party Starters Co. Mordecai presses a button on an intercom, looking frustrated.)

Mordecai: Come on, just let us in!

(Elevator music is heard. Mordecai and Rigby throw up their arms and groan in response.)

Rigby: We've been at it for half an hour, they're never gonna let us in!

(Skips points at something offscreen)

Skips: What about those guys?

(The camera pans over to two business men, who appear to be amused about something. Mordecai turns around to talk to them.)

Mordecai: Hey, do you guys work here?

(The business men look at him angrily before bursting out laughing)

Vince: Uh... double duh!

Tommy: (He points at Vince) We got the Vince!

Vince: (He points back at Tommy) We got the Tommy!

(Vince throws his hands up in the air while Tommy excitedly fist pumps behind him)

Tommy & Vince: We're the best presidents of par-tay!

(They fist bump)

Vince: (To Tommy) Epic dude, epic. (Tommy nods in agreement)

Mordecai: We're looking for our friend Benson. Have you seen him?

Tommy: (Who crosses his arms) We don't know any Benson. But if you're looking for Party Benson, you'll have to call the hotline like everyone else.

Skips: Well, can we talk to Party Benson, then?

Vince: (Shrugs) Yeah, can't help you gramps. We don't know you.

Tommy: Now step aside. Our 24/7 partying requires sush fuel.

Pops: (Who is confused) Sush?

Vince: (Pinches the bridge of his nose) Sushi, the Chinese food! (Throws his head back in disgust) Augh!

Tommy: We're done with you harshmellows. Now go back to the park before we kick you out ourselves!

Skips: (Points at Tommy accusingly) Wait. How'd you know we're from the park?

(Tommy and Vince look on with surprised expressions on their faces. Vince quickly summons a pair of guards, who immediately take action and join the two business men.)

Vince: (Crosses his arms) Remove these dudes from the premises!

(The two guards angrily march up to the groundskeepers. One of the guards repeatedly snaps at Mordecai and points him in the direction of the park, forcing him to leave along with everybody else.) 

(A clock transition shows everybody arriving back at the park house, looking dejected)

Muscle Man: Augh, those guys were such jerks!

Mordecai: Yeah, something weird is going on.

Muscle Man: Yeah, Benson wouldn't abandon the park. Not even to keep the party going! (Quickly puts his hands up in defense) Which, I'll admit, is a respectable life choice.

Mordecai: (Who is deep in thought) There's gotta be a way to reach Benson!

Rigby: (Throws his hands up) Uh, hello! The lame-os in the suits told us what to do.

(We cut to Rigby using the house phone. He dials the number for Party Starters and turns to face the others as the dial tone chimes. Everyone watches in anticipation as Rigby begins to speak into the phone.)

Rigby: Hello, Party Starters? Yeah, it's an emergency. I'm a helpless loser with no friends and I can't get the party started. My name? (Smirks) Mordecai.

(Mordecai punches Rigby in the face, causing him to shriek in agony. The camera shows Mordecai with a pissed off expression. Rigby then continues to speak into the phone, although it sounds like he's in great pain.)

Rigby (continued): Huh? No, I'm fine. I uh... fell down the stairs. Anyway, I'll need your hardiest partyer. Yeah, Party Benson; that's the one! Fifty bucks? Sure, send him over!

(He hangs up the phone and crosses his arms victoriously)

Rigby (continued): Hmm, hmm. (Quickly loses his cocky attitude) Anybody got fifty bucks?

(The doorbell rings. Rigby quickly runs out of the kitchen and answers the door. As soon as he does, music is heard playing in the background. The first thing we see is Party Benson's excited face, equipped with yellow sunglasses. The camera then proceeds to zoom in on Party Benson's outfit, along with a pair of genuine leather boots. He "pelvic thrusts,"/ and the camera pans up to show him standing in between two ladies from the Party Starters company. The music stops as soon as Party Benson asks a question.) "" = In the UK, the scene is changed to him being frozen due to it being a sexual thrust.))

Party Benson: (Holds his hand out) You got the fifty dollars?

(Rigby scurries back into the living room, along with Party Benson and the Party Starters girls)

Mordecai: Benson! There you are!

Pops: (Clasps his hands together) Oh, thank goodness!

Party Benson: Alright, let's get this party started!

(He proceeds to put a tape into a boombox and clicks the play button. He begins dancing with the Party Starters girls. The park groundskeepers look at each other in concern. Party Benson unties the one girl's bandana from around her neck and ties it around his head, similar to what he did before with Audrey. He dances with her, and the other girl joins in as well. Having had enough, Skips skips over angrily.)

Skips: Alright, enough! Benson, this isn't you.

Party Benson: Of course it's me! Party Benson, just like you ordered.

Muscle Man: Don't you know us, bro?

Party Benson: (Puts his arms up) All I know is... it's party time!

(He starts dancing again, and the ladies follow his lead. Skips grabs his shoulders and shakes him.)

Skips: Snap out of it!

Party Girl 1: Hey! Hands off, man!

(The other Party Starters girl pulls Skips away from Benson)

Mordecai: (Puts a hand to his forehead) Augh. This is hopeless! Just let him go; the party's over.

Party Benson: Did you say the party's over? Then my job here is done.

(The camera zooms out as Party Benson explodes into rainbow colored confetti. Everybody coughs as the smoke begins to clear.)

Mordecai: Benson? (Coughs) Benson!

(The camera zooms into a pile of leftover confetti and Party Benson's discarded boots)

Pops: (Horrified) Oh, no! Benson blew up! (He begins to wail like a frightened child)

Skips: Pops, there's gotta be an explanation!

(While Skips is saying this, Rigby bends down to pick up some of the confetti)

Rigby: What is this? Confetti?

(The camera zooms into the confetti in Rigby's hand)

Mordecai: Wait, where are the Party Girls?

(The camera shows the Party Girls making a getaway outside. Rigby runs over to the window and points.)

Rigby: There they are!

(The Party Girls nonchalantly get into their Party Starters van and drive away)

Mordecai: We gotta follow 'em.

(The Party Starters van is then shown heading to an unknown location. The park workers follow close behind in the golf cart. The camera zooms in to the groundskeepers, who all have determined looks on their faces. The van pulls into the parking lot of the Party Starters Company's main building. The Party Girls get out of the van and head inside, just as the park workers pull up in the golf cart. Mordecai looks around cautiously and motions for the others to follow him inside. Pops closes the door as quietly as he can behind them. They begin to walk around and take in their surroundings.)

Rigby: So many party options!

Skips: There's some kind of elevator up ahead.

(The park groundskeepers reach the elevator. Rigby takes a device off the wall and presses a green button. The camera zooms into Mordecai and Rigby's feet as the ground rumbles beneath them. The camera zooms back out as everyone murmurs in surprise. The elevator takes them underground, with the exception of High Five Ghost floating along behind them. The elevator stops at what appears to be some sort of secret underground lair. All sorts of machinery is scattered throughout the room.)

Rigby: Whoa, what is this place?

(They begin to walk around and stop to examine a group of cylindrical glass cases. Muscle Man wipes some dust off of one of the glass containers, revealing a girl who looks dressed up for a disco dance.)

Muscle Man: (Confused) Party Zoe?

(Rigby does the same thing with another glass case, and an eighties-looking robot is revealed)

Rigby: (Confused) Party Robert?

(Mordecai wipes the dust off of a third cylindrical case and looks on in complete shock)

Mordecai: Benson! 

(He pushes a button beside of the container, and Benson is finally released. He opens his eyes and groans, slowly stepping out of the case. Mordecai and Rigby bend down to help him up.)

Mordecai (continued): Benson, are you okay? What happened?

(Benson continues to groan and steps away as everyone else rushes over)

Benson: I'm okay, I'm okay. It all happened after the party.

(A flashback begins)

Benson (continued): I remember saying goodnight to Audrey, and then I walked to my car.

(Benson waves as Audrey drives away in her car. He then proceeds to walk over to his own vehicle. He opens his door as two business men approach him.)

Benson (continued): That's when two guys wearing suits stopped me. They said they liked my partying and asked me if I wanted to go pro.

(The two business men are shown talking and gesturing for Benson to join them)

Benson (continued): I said "no." 

(Benson is shown actually mouthing the word 'no' to them)

Benson (continued): Then they said they'd at least like to induct me into the partying hall of fame.

(The two men in suits are shown asking the question together. Benson looks at them with a smile on his face.)

Benson (continued): I said "sure."

(Flashback Benson does just that. A van is then seen pulling into the parking lot of the Party Starters building. Benson and the men in suits get out of the van.)

Benson (continued): They showed me their cloning equipment and explained that they cloned the best partyers in the world to keep the party going.

(Benson is seen walking around with the business men, admiring the equipment)

Benson (continued): By the time I realized there was no partying hall of fame, it was too late.

(Benson is shoved into one of the glass containers. His hands are cuffed to the wall, and Tommy walks over with a triumphant grin on his face.)

Tommy: (Laughs) I can't believe you actually thought there was a partying hall of fame. Clooooooone!

(Tommy pushes a button beside the container, and a clone of Benson is immediately formed. It proceeds to do the worm and mockingly dances in front of the real Benson, to his dismay. The real Benson screams in terror.)

Benson (continued): Noooo!

(The flashback ends in a wisp of smoke)

Benson (continued): I'm just glad you guys were able to save me.

Rigby: Looks like we solved the case of the missing Benson. Let's roll.

(He begins to walk away, but Benson stops him)

Benson: Wait. We gotta save the rest of these guys!

Pops: Oooooh, come quick!

(He motions for everybody to join him at another glass case, and they immediately run over. They all gasp at what they see.)

Mordecai: Party Pete!

(Rigby pushes a button, trying to release Party Pete. However, he only ends up creating another clone, much to Mordecai's dismay.)

Party Pete Clone: Party Pete in the house!

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: What? The buttons are really close together.

(He then pushes the correct button, releasing the real Party Pete. He drops to the ground, looking exhausted. Party Pete's clone strides away happily.)

Mordecai: Party Pete, are you okay?

Party Pete: Yeah, but it's not Party Pete. It's Peter Hermanverful. Thank you for saving me. Now I can go back to doing what I really love to do: playing Sudoku!

Skips: Open those other tubes, and let's get out of here!

(Muscle Man releases Party Zoe, while High Five Ghost goes to release Party Robert)

Party Zoe: (Emerging) Oh... honey don't like that.

Party Robert: (Puts a hand to his head) What happened? Is the party over?

(He looks over at Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Not yet, Ro bro! We gotta jet!

(He points in the other direction before running away. Party Zoe, Party Robert, and High Five Ghost follow in hot pursuit. The camera then shows everybody riding back upstairs on the elevator. Rigby, Mordecai, and Benson gasp as a group of people come into view.)

Rigby: Oh, no! Guards!

Guard: Don't let them escape!

Party Pete: There's only one way out! We have to party through!

(Party Pete, Party Zoe, and Party Robert all get into a fighting stance. Party Pete then proceeds to dance up to a guard and punch him in the face. Everybody charges forward, punching as many guards as they can. Rigby leaps onto a guard's arm, but is immediately punched off. Mordecai is seen wrestling with another guard until a blow hits him in the face, causing him to be pushed back. He groans softly before realizing that he has landed against a large container of soda.) 

Mordecai: Rigby!

(Punching is heard in the background as Rigby gets up off of the floor and runs over to Mordecai. He helps Mordecai rip open the box, and soda cans spill out. Mordecai and Rigby pick up a few cans and call out to the partyers.)

Mordecai (continued): Hey, party people! Drink up!

(He and Rigby toss three cans of soda. Party Zoe, Party Robert, and Party Pete abruptly stop fighting and catch the cans of soda. They quickly drink it, and a green glow forms around them.)

Party Pete: Someone's about to get soda-popped!

Party Zoe: Let's dance!

(Party Zoe uses her newfound energy to zap three guards with discoball-like beams of light. Party Robert does the robot and blasts two guards back. Party Pete spins around and points at a guard, zapping him with a bolt of energy. The guard flies back onto a bouncy castle and is bounced right out of a window. Party Zoe uses some energy to send a guard flying through the air, and he comes to rest on the horn of a giant rhinoceros ice sculpture. Two guards corner Rigby, but he grabs a wiffle ball bat and knocks them to the ground. He then proceeds to use the bat to break open a pinata, stealing all the candy he can and running away with it. The park employees and Party Pete are seen trying to escape.) 

Mordecai: (Points) There's the exit!

Party Pete: Let's get out of here!

(Before they can leave, however, Party Pete's clone steps in front of them and closes the door)

Party Pete's Clone: Hey, where are you going? (He starts dancing) The party's just getting staaarted!

(Vince and Tommy walk over, equipped with bazookas. The Party Girls follow suit.)

Vince: Yeah, thanks, Party Pete. We'll take it from here.

Party Robert: Step aside.

(He holds out his hand, threatening to blast them with a beam of energy)

Vince: What? You think we won't shoot?

Party Zoe: (Points) No way, man. You fools need us.

Tommy: Oh, yeah? Well, disco is dead!

(He fires a shot at Party Zoe, causing her to be blown into bits. Rigby and Muscle Man manage to dodge out of the way just in time. Party Zoe's head is the only thing that remains.)

Party Zoe: Aw, man!

Vince: And the eighties are so over!

(He fires at Party Robert. Benson shields himself from the blast. Party Robert is flung backwards, yelling "Ow!" in the process. As soon as he makes impact with the ground, he explodes.)

Vince (continued): No one's even ordered those two in years.

(The camera shows Benson and Party Pete looking on with angry expressions)

Vince (continued): You're our best sellers, and cloning is the future of partying.

(He gestures to Party Pete's clone dancing in the background)

Vince (continued): And that's why we're keeping you right here. Now back in the lab!

Benson: No! (He picks up a gigantic hose) Guys, take cover!

(Everybody gets out of the way. Half of them duck behind a big wooden structure, while the rest of them hide behind a wall of boxes.)

Benson (continued): My life's more important than your party.

(Tommy and Vince laugh at this)

Vince: You're kidding.

Tommy: You're an aging park manager with an anger problem.

(Ignoring their insults, Benson points to the gigantic can of Radicola behind him)

Benson: Hey, Party Pete! Think you can drink this whole can of soda?

(Party Pete's clone shoves Tommy and Vince out of the way in response)

Party Pete's Clone: Oh yeah, man! Lay it on me right here!

(The clone eagerly gestures to his mouth)

Benson: You got it, man.

(He turns the hose on full blast. Tommy and Vince scream out a helpless "No!" as Party Pete's clone starts drinking the soda. The business men and the Party Girls get out of the way as Party Pete's clone begins to expand. Benson continues to shoot soda into the clone's mouth, causing him to grow bigger until he eventually explodes. The Party Starters' building is destroyed. Everybody lays on the ground moaning as the police show up.)

Policeman w/Moustache: We came when we saw the explosion.

Rigby: You guys got here fast!

Policeman w/Moustache: Of course we did. We're the police!

(The camera then shows two other policemen, who have Tommy and Vince in their custody)

Blonde Policeman: Sir, these are the guys from that underground party cloning ring.

Policeman w/Moustache: Looks like the party's over.

(The policemen begin to take Vince and Tommy away)

Vince: (Angrily) We'll get you for this, Benson brah! (He gets in the cop car)

Tommy: Yeah, we just wanted to pay off our student loans!

(He enters the cop car, and a policeman shuts the door)

Big Chinned Policeman: Save it for the judge.

(The cops drive away)

Benson: Thanks for getting me out of there, guys. I should've known not to cut loose on a weekday like that. I guess I'll go back to sorting time sheets and multivitamins.

(He begins to walk away somberly)

Skips: Well, that's not gonna work.

Benson: Huh?

(Benson stops in his tracks, and Skips skips over to him)

Skips: This calls for a celebration, (He puts his arm around Benson) and we've got the best party starter in town!

(We cut back to the park house. Benson and Audrey are seen dancing together. Party Pete is about to walk away.)

Mordecai: Peter! Uh, I mean... Hey, Hermanverful! (Mordecai lightly grabs his arm) Why don't you stay and party with us?

Party Pete: (Shrugs) I'm all partied out! I want to see what it's like to complete a puzzle, or paint a pewter wizard. Besides, I'm not like Benson. (Points) He's the real deal.

(Audrey is seen giving food to Benson)

Mordecai: Yes, he is.

(End of Party Re-Pete)

(The episode starts in The Coffee Shop. Mordecai and Rigby sing a breakfast rap)

Rigby: (beat-boxing)

Mordecai: (raps) Eggs and sausage. Hot sauce and ketchup. Now that's what I call a healthy big breakfast! (beat-boxes)

Rigby: (raps) Worried 'bout your thighs? Put the mayonnaise on the side. I said mayonnaise on the side. Why you starin' at my thighs?!

Mordecai: On the side I keep my mayo. All my people say heyooooo!! (both laugh) Yeah, I hate mayo.

Margaret:  (on phone) No, it's cool, it's fine.. yeah, no, no I'll figure it out. Okay bye. Uugh... (sits on the chair)

Rigby: Dude, Margaret, this eggs are good! Got any extra mayo?

Mordecai: What's wrong?

Margaret: My friend Tania just bailed on me. She was supposed to give me a ride to the airport.

Mordecai: Wait, you're going on a trip?

Margaret: Yeah! Didn't I tell you? It's just this... I'm going to check out this University of States... well, I'll probably never even get in, but...

Mordecai: Wow, a university.

Rigby: I thought you're already in school?

Margaret: Yeah, the Community College! But I'm just getting my general studies out of the way, so I can transfer and focus on what I really wanna do. Hey sorry, I gotta figure this out. My interview with the university is first thing tomorrow so, I can't miss my flight tonight.

Mordecai: Hey Margaret, I can take you.

Margaret: Really?

Mordecai: Yeah sure, I'll give you a ride.

Margaret: (hugs Mordecai) Oh my gosh! Thank you! You're a life saver!

Mordecai: Baaaaahh... pfft...

Margaret: Wait, are you sure you want to give me a ride? And not because you bet someone you could or...

Mordecai: Pfft! What, come on! When have I... (Rigby wanted to say something) Be quiet! Look no bets, no nothing, I just wanna help you out.

Margaret: Cause' I just need a simple ride to the airport. We leave early, get there with plenty of time, no getting off-track, no craziness.

Mordecai: Trust me, I got it.

Margaret: Okay! Heh... sorry... thank you so much! This is really nice of you Mordecai.

Mordecai: No problem.

Margaret: Pick me up in front of the main building at six o'clock.

Mordecai: Six o'clock. I got it.

Margaret: I'm going to see if there's any old cinnamon rolls left for you.

Mordecai: Yeah-yuh!

(The scene changes to Pops's House with Benson talking to Mr. Maellard on the telephone in Benson's Office)

Benson: (on phone)......Yes Mr. Maellard, I'm sorry sir.

Mordecai: (knocks the door) Benson?

Benson: Absolutely, I'm working on it right now. Of course sir, I-. (sighs) What is it Mordecai?

Mordecai: Uhh.. are you redecorating here? Ahah.. I knew it! New poster right? Ha.. really cool. (low voice) can I borrow the cart?

Benson:  What? Shouldn't you be working? (writing and using calculator) I thought I told you to rake the leaves?

Mordecai: Oh.. yeah, yeah! I finished that.. ahah.. (low voice) can I borrow the cart?

Benson: What?!

Mordecai: (low voice) Can I borrow the cart?

Benson: Look, I'm busy! What do you want!? SPEAK UP!

Mordecai: (sighs) Can I borrow the cart?

Benson: No. But you can borrow my car.

Mordecai: Really?!

Benson: My car is in the shop getting some work done. Calm down, it's just being detailed. Anyway if you go pick it up, you can borrow it.

Mordecai: I can totally do that! Thanks, Benson! You're the best!

Benson: Meh.. saves me the trip (writes something on the note) Here's the address. (hands it to Mordecai)

Mordecai: Downtown?! How am I supposed to get all the way over there?!

Benson: (answers the phone and covers it with his hand) I hope you got good walking shoes...! (on phone) Yes, Mr. Maellard.

Mordecai: Ugh! (The scene changes to Downtown with heavy traffic and Mordecai asking a guy in a newsstand) (holding a note) Hey, excuse me, is there a quick way through mid-town?

Newsstand Guy: Uhh.. sure, the pass is way through 7th....

Mordecai: Cool, 7th. Thanks!

Newsstand Guy: But... I wouldn't go through that part of town...

(Mordecai walks through the creepy-looking 7th Street and his phone rings)

Mordecai: (on phone) Hello?

Margaret: (on phone) Mordecai, what's up?

Mordecai: (on phone) Margaret, hey, hi! How's it going?

Margaret: (on phone) Goooood! Just headin' in my class.

Mordecai: (on phone) Oh yeah. (looks at the guys sitting on the trash bin)

Lee: Hey, hey! Where are you going man? Hey is that a cellphone?!

Nate: No cellphones man, can't you read?

Mordecai: Don't have any change, man. (on phone) Sorry, just some dudes yelling something.

Margaret: (on phone) Hey, so you're still cool to pick me up later, yeah?

Mordecai: (on phone) Yeah! We're all set.

Margaret: (on phone) Awesome. (a croquet ball rolls towards Mordecai. He bends down to pick it up. As he bends back up, he sees that a gang has appeared and is staring at him. He gives the ball to their leader) You know, I really appreciate this. If you believe in coming to a ride to the airport, those are the most important people in your life.

Mordecai: (on phone) Yeah, exactly!

Margaret: (on phone) I mean, I don't know why didn't I just asked you in the first place?

Mordecai: (on phone) Yeah.. I.. know, hey can you hold a sec? (covers the phone mic) Heey, guys, what's up?

Wicket Leader: Didn't ya here my boys earlier?! No cellphones!

Mordecai: What? Why not?

Wicket Leader: Nobody talks back to "The Wickets"!

Mordecai: The "Wickeds"?

Wicket Leader: Wickets! (Holds up a croquet wicket) Wickets! Don't you play croquet?!

Mordecai: Okay! The Wickets! I'm sorry!

Barranca: Actually, "The Wickeds" kinda sounds tougher, really!

Thompson: Well, would it be "The Wicked Wickets" that sounds pretty cool.

Wicket Leader: Quiet! We'll discuss it in our next general meeting! (talks back to Mordecai) I guess you're not from around here but, this is our turf! And nobody uses cellphones on our turf!

The Wickets: Yeah!

Margaret: (on phone) Mordecai? Who's voice is that?

Mordecai: What? Uhh... just... nobody!

Wicket Leader: Ohh... he thinks we're nobody's!

Mordecai: Look guys, I'm just trying to get to the mechanics!

Margaret: (on phone) Mordecai, are you in trouble?

Mordecai: (on phone) Hahah.. what? Trouble? No.

Wicket Leader: You don't want trouble? Then don't break the rules!

Mordecai: What do you got against cellphones?!

Gaston: They're rude! (smashes a cellphone on the ground)

Mordecai: (on phone) I gotta go, I'll see you soon!

Margaret: (on phone) See you at six!

Mordecai: (on phone) Bye!

Wicket Leader: Smart kid... Let this be a warning to you, Mordecai! (shouts) No cellphones in our territory, got it?! Nobody crosses "The Wickets"! (echoing)

(Mordecai runs out of the alley then pants and saw the autoshop)

Mordecai: (panting) Finally... (walks closer on the Mechanic)

Raymond: Can I help you?

Mordecai: Yeah, I'm picking up the wagon. Is it all set?

Raymond: Yeah, the key's on it. (looks at Mordecai) You're not Benson!

Mordecai: No, I'm Mordecai. I work for Ben-

Raymond: Only owner can pick up car.

Mordecai: What? But Benson sent me!

Raymond: Rules are rules.

Mordecai: Dude, come on! I have to get this girl a ride to the airport and I'm already running late!

Raymond: I wish I have girl problems.

Mordecai: Uuuugh! (calls Benson) Benson, I'm at the mechanics, he won't let me take your car cuz' I'm not you!

Benson: (on phone) Fine, I'll just pick it up tomorrow.

Mordecai: (on phone) No! I need to borrow it now, remember?

Benson: (on phone) (sighs) Put me on speaker.

Mordecai: (puts the phone on speaker) Hey, Benson wants to talk to you.

Raymond: Hello?

Benson: (on phone) Listen Raymond, can you please just give Mordecai my car?

Raymond: Bensonrules is rules!

Benson: (on phone) Look, I'm too busy to go down there. Some of us have REAL jobs!

Raymond: Oh what, Raymond don't have real job?!

Benson: (on phone) If the cover all's fit!

Mordecai: Oh jeez.. (facepalms then hears something)

Wicket Leader: (hidden) Mordecai, put your phone away. (Mordecai looks around then sees him. He is bumping 3 croquet balls on his hand) Mordecai, put your phone away! (Mordecai gasps) (still bumping 3 balls on his hand) (deranged tone) Mordecai, put your phone away! (looks at the "The Wickets" Leader on the car) (a bit louder) Mordecai, put your phone away!! Mordecai, put your phone away!! Mordecai, put your phone away!! ("The Wickets" started appearing everywhere in the autoshop) (shouting) Mordecai, put your phone away!!!

Raymond:  (Argument with Benson ends when he sees "The Wickets") The Wickets.. AAAAAAAAHHHH!!! (runs away to his office)

The Wickets Leader: We've warned you, Mordecai!

Mordecai: Look, leave me alone! Go back to playing mini-golf!

Wicket Leader: It's croquet! Raaaaaah! (attempts to hammer Mordecai but he dodged it)

Mordecai: Aaahh! Got to go Benson!

Benson: (on phone) Wait?

(Mordecai dodges more things then sled below the vehicle. "The Wickets" surrounded the car where Mordecai is under then Raymond left his office wearing a fire suit and  holding a flamethrower)

Raymond: Hey, Wickets! (uses the flamethrower at "The Wickets")

(Mordecai rans away from The Wickets and went to Benson's car)

Wicket Leader: Hey! (points at Benson's car)

Mordecai: (starting Benson's car and went to reverse then the muscled guy dived on the top of the car) Waaaaaaaahh! (the guy fell and drove to the main building to pick up Margaret then nearly goes outside the car) Hey Margaret! Let me help with your-...

Margaret:  (Freaking out) No time! I messed up! My plane leaves at 6:30, not 9:30! We have like 15 minutes to get to the airport! Do you think you can drive fast?

Mordecai: (looks at the rear mirror and saw The Wickets driving towards him) Not a problem. (fastened his seatbelt and shifted to "drive" and drove away and saw The Wickets again on the rear mirror)

Gaston: (moving the hammer up and down) Mordecaaaai!

Margaret: Are those guys saying your name?

Mordecai: What? No, I don't think so!

(A girl in "The Wickets" sprays "WICKETS" on the side of Benson's car and threw the empty spray can on the side window)

Tambrya: Hahahahhahaaaaaaa!!

Margaret: (gasps) What the heck! (Mordecai and her looked behind. Benson's car is being bumped by The Wickets and Mordecai lost a bit of control but gets back on track) What's going on?!

Mordecai: Okay, don't freak out but, those guys kinda want to kill me for using a cellphone.

Margaret: What!?

Mordecai: I can explain!

Margaret: Now let me guess, you lost a bet, or did you hijack this car from some argyle wearing crime lord?

Mordecai: It's Benson's car!

Margaret: That's it! I'm calling the cops! (takes out her phone and dials "911")

Mordecai: NO! (tries to prevent Margaret from using the cellphone then The Wickets smash the side mirror and nab Margaret's phone)

Margaret: (screams)

Wicket Leader: I said no cellphones! (crushes Margaret's phone using his hand, "The Wickets" bumps Benson's car on the side and surrounded by whole gang, they hammered the vehicle everywhere)

Mordecai: Hang on! (turns the vehicle to a closed road then ramped on the side of the truck)

("The Wickets" on motorcycles attempted to dodge the rolling barrels but crashed on the side, leaving "The Wickets" on the car remain on trail)

Margaret:  (looks on the broken side mirror then gasped)

Wicket Leader: Come on, come on!

Margaret: Uuughh! This is hopeless! These guys won't quit!

Mordecai: I won't quit, either. (drives faster, and is about to drive through a dead end)

Margaret:  (sees dead end of the road) Mordecaii!

Mordecai: Just trust me!

Margaret: Okay! I trust you!

(Mordecai turned the vehicle so they won't fly out the dead end and "The Wickets" ramped away and crashed on a cellphone billboard killing them and making platypuses extinct then Mordecai arrived on the airport and they both panted. They both hurriedly went to the airport)

Margaret: We're not gonna make it!

Mordecai: (Mordecai found a bag stroller) Jump on! (Mordecai pushed faster to reach the flight and Margaret hands the ticket to the lady)

Airport Lady: Boarding is now closed, thank you!

(Mordecai fell down the stroller after turning it on the side then Margaret quickly hands her flight ticket)

Airport Lady: AHHH! (winces)

Margaret: Wait! Please! I need to go on this flight!

Airport Lady: (sighs and lifted the telephone) (agitated tone) Hold the gate please.

Margaret: Thank you! Thank you. (puts her bag away)

Mordecai: (puts Margaret's big bag away and a love song plays in the background) See? We made it!

Margaret: Yeah! Look, I'm sorry for all that stuff I said before. I was kind of freaking out. I never should've doubted you.

Mordecai: Psscht! Nah! Psscht! It's no big deal.

Margaret: I'm serious! You're always there for me. I guess.. I mean.. there's not a lot of people I can say that about.

Airport Lady: (interrupts and angrily) Ma'am!

Margaret: I should get going.

Mordecai: Yeah.

Margaret: Well, see ya!

Mordecai: Yeah.. uh.. I mean, see ya!

Margaret: Yeah, bye!

Mordecai: Uhh... wait! Guuhh... good luck!

Margaret: Thanks.

Mordecai: Uhh, nothing, sorry, see ya.

Margaret: (sighs, then walks back to and kissed Mordecai in the lip, and Mordecai is surprised by this. After the kiss, Margaret leaves for her plane) See you soon!

Mordecai: (looks traumatized at the kiss) Uhh.. bye.. (waves goodbye and leaves the airport. "We Are the Champions" starts to play while Mordecai jumps in joy, shakes a man, and then stops celebrating as he sees Benson's car being towed away.) 

(End of "Picking Up Margaret")

(We begin at the porch of the park house. Benson has an announcement for the six original groundskeepers)

Benson: Alright, everyone. As you know, today is the annual pie contest. And, surprise, surprise, we're gonna do it the same as last year. Skips, you're on podium duty. (Skips nods, and walks off, carrying a rake) Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, you guys go and set up the booths.

Muscle Man: Yeah! (high-fives Hi Five Ghost) Later grandmas! (runs off)

Benson: Pops, you're in charge of decoration.

Pops: Oh, rest assured, it will be a delight to the senses. (He walks off.)

Benson: I'll be in charge of judging the pie contest. (focus on Mordecai and Rigby) Mordecai and Rigby, just go pick up garbage or something. (Mordecai groans)

Rigby: Aw, what?

Mordecai: Ugh! Why do we always get the lame jobs?!

Rigby: Yeah, why can't we judge the pies?

Benson: (chuckles) Yeah right! You have no idea what it takes.

Rigby: Uh, I'm gonna guess eating a bunch of pies.

Benson: No, it's not just eating a bunch of pies! Trust me on this, you're not ready.

Rigby: Come on, how hard can it be? I eat pies all the time.

Benson: (groans) This isn't a game, Rigby.

Mordecai: Dude, just give us a chance! You always give us jobs we hate. If you gave us a job we liked for once, we might actually be good at it!

Benson: I don't have time for this. Go pick up some trash or you're fired. (gets in the golf cart and drives away. M&R chase him down the dirt road)

Mordecai: Wait!

(focus on Benson. We hear the duo land on the roof of the cart, then, from Benson's POV, we see M&R hanging from the roof)

Mordecai and Rigby: Let us be judges!

Benson: (screams, then, hits the brake, flinging M&R to the ground and leaving them barely conscious. Benson then walks up, annoyed) You are actually willing to put yourselves in physical danger just so you can judge pies?! (M&R moan in their state of pain) Okay, fine. But I warned you. If you come to me wanting to quit, YOU'RE FIRED! (storms off. M&R then high-five)

(clock transition to a mini-montage of the beginning of the pie contest. Some contestants have set up. Then, we pan down from the pie contest banner to M&R, wearing the judge ribbons as the contestants look on. The duo nod, and then walk into the contest. A girl waves to the duo, and Mordecai nods flirtatiously. Rigby does the same to a trio of girls looking on. Next, we see two teenagers talking. The blonde teen taps the ginger's shoulder, and points towards M&R. The ginger turns, revealing his pie-shaped sunglasses, and greets Mordecai. Finally, M&R look at the pies set up. There are apple pies, strawberry pies, and even chocolate pies. The montage then ends on M&R walking up to judge Pops' pie)

Rigby: Hey, Pops. What kind of pie did you make?

Pops: This is my cherry tart! Put out your hand, put out your hand! (Pops places one slice of cherry pie into Mordecai's and Rigby's hands. The duo then begin eating the pies, and show approval)

Mordecai: This is great, Pops!

Pops: (laughs) I'm so glad to know it would be you two who will honor me with my tenth blue ribbon.

Rigby: Hang on, Pops, not so fast! There is a chance someone else's pie will win.

Mordecai: Yeah, we can't make any promises.

Pops: (almost cries) Oh, I understand. (walks over to a display of his blue ribbons. He touches the area he planned to hang the tenth ribbon) Then I guess blue ribbon number ten will just have to wait.

(M&R are lost deep in thought. Clock transition to Muscle Man's and Starla's stand. M&R walk up)

Rigby: So what do we have here?

Starla : It's a rhubarb tartlet.

Muscle Man: (points at the duo) And you're gonna love it. (reaches hand to Starla's cheek) Starla put her heart and soul into this pie. Didn't you, baby? (grabs forks and digs into the tartlet) Okay, judges, judge this! (M&R grab the forks, and eat the piece. They almost vomit at the sour taste, but manage to swallow it) Now give her the blue ribbon, ladies.

Mordecai: Um, we can't just give Starla the blue ribbon...

Muscle Man: (grabs M&R and pins them against his face) If Starla's rhubarb pie doesn't win, the next pie you taste will be thrown in a tube! (close up of Muscle Man's face) Because you'll be in a hospital bed, hooked to life support! (throws M&R to the ground)

Starla: (runs over to Muscle Man to hug him) Oh, Mitch! (MM&S kiss. As they do, Muscle Man makes the "I'm watching you" sign to M&R)

(clock transition to M&R walking through the stands)

Mordecai: Man, that was horrible! Judging's a lot harder than it looks.

Rigby: (Points) But not too hard to judge THAT pie!

(Shows a very gross looking pie)

Mordecai: Ahhh, sick!

Rigby: I feel sorry for the apples that died to make this!

Mordecai: I wonder what sort of loser made this loser pie.

Margaret : (Comes running to Mordecai and Rigby) Mordecai! Rigby! Hey guys, wait up!

Rigby: Oh dude! How much do you want to bet this is Margaret's pie?

Mordecai: (Punches Rigby) Hey Margaret, how's it going?

Margaret: (Holds out two forks) Ready to try my pie?

Rigby: Hmm-hmm.

Mordecai: (Punches Rigby) Heh heh, we'd love to, 'cus we're judges... (Mordecai and Rigby get a piece, and the pie makes a fart sound as they do.) (Mordecai and Rigby eat the pie, and they gag and try not to throw up (Gagging) Oh, declicious!

Mordecai and Rigby: Heh heh....heh....

Margaret: So what do you think? Here's my score card. I won't look right away if you don't want me to.

Mordecai: Uhh..huh...we forgot our pencils! (Runs away with Rigby. Mordecai and Rigby are walking by more pies, but are now confused to which one they should give the pie to).

Mordecai: Ughhh! Dude, judging BLOWS! I don't wanna tell people the truth about their pies!

Rigby: I know! If we don't pick Starla, Muscle Man is gonna freak out on us!

Mordecai: I can't tell Margaret about her pie, she'll never talk to me again!

Rigby: And what about Pops? He almost cried and we actually liked his pie.

Mordecai: (Sighs) Everyone's totally gonna hate us after this.

Benson: (Walks in with sunglasses) (snooty tone) Well, well, well. Sounds like pie judging is not as easy as you thought, is it?

Rigby: No, it's totally easy.

Benson: Whoa, whoa, don't get all testy. (Takes a bite of a pie)

Mordecai: What's that?

Benson: (mocking tone) Oh this, it's a piece of pie. You know what the best about cleaning is? You pretty much get to eat pie all day. I don't think I picked a single piece of trash yet. (Takes another piece of a pie, while Mordecai and Rigby scowl at him) Yeah, judging was the worst. Telling people what I think about their pies, hurting their feelings, crushing their dreams. Well, just let me know when you guys wanna quit. (Eats the rest of his pie) Oh wait, you can't, because if you do, I get to fire you. (laughs obnoxiously at their faces) Happy judging, fellas! (laughs while running off)

Rigby: Uggh. I don't want to judge this contest anymore.

Promise Pie: (Off-screen) I can it judge it for you.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Who said that?

Promise Pie: (Off-screen) I'm over here. Over by the trash can. (Mordecai and Rigby open the trash can revealing that the voice they heard was a talking pie) Hi.

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugh!

Mordecai: Who are you?

Promise Pie: I'm Promise Pie.

Rigby: Cool. (reaching out his hand) Talking pie.

Mordecai: (Stops Rigby) Dude, don't touch it.

Promise Pie: Wait, I can help you.

Mordecai: How can you help us?

Promise Pie: I can help you pick the winner.

Rigby: Really?

Promise Pie: Oh yes, trust me, it will be as easy as pie. (laughs)

(Mordecai closes the bin)

Mordecai: Yeah, we'll take a rain check on the talking pie advice. Come on, dude, we have to do this ourselves. There's gotta be a way to judge this competition without makin' everybody hate us!

(Mordecai and Rigby think about how to best judge the contest)

Rigby: (He gasps) Dude! (He snaps his fingers)

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: I know what we gotta do! (He snaps fingers on both hands)

Mordecai: Dude, what is it?

Rigby: Oh, man it's so simple! We just gotta give everyone a perfect score! (He again snaps fingers on both hands and he then points to the ground) Boom!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Yeah, dude! If we give everyone a ten then everyone wins! And nobody hates us. (He snaps his fingers again) Boom!

Moredcai: Dude, that's actually a really good idea!

Rigby: Yeah, man everybody's gonna be pumped! (He snaps his fingers for the final time)

Mordecai: Time to finish judging this contest right.

(cut to another mini-montage of M&R walking down an isle, rows of pies at their sides. They come up to Skips and they eat some of his pie, they then write his score on some paper, M&R show it to him, revealing a ten. They then go to Hi Five Ghost and eat his pie, as they do, ghosts stream out of their eyes. Rigby gives him a ten. Mordecai pokes Death's pie, Ravens come out of it, Mordecai gives him a ten. We then cut to Gary , his "pie" in front of him, M&R also give him a ten, they are sparkling. We also cut to Eileen , she is smiling, M&R give her a ten, her pie all over their faces. We cut to M&R spinning around gleefully, each holding a perfect score, then there is a quick flash of M&R giving out tens. We then cut to M&R on a spinning pie, each holding up a ten. Finally we cut to them giving out tens, they throw the tens into the screen, ending the montage.)

(Many people are standing outside the tent)

Rigby: Dude, we did it, we judged those pies in their faces!

Mordecai: Yeah, we did!

Mordecai and Rigby: Perfect score! Perfect score! Perfect score!

Moredcai: But, seriously, dude, we're never judging again.

Rigby: Yeah, man.

(Benson enters)

Benson: Alright guys, let's go, it's time to pick a winner.

Rigby: Oh, it's cool, we gave everyone perfect scores, so it's a tie.

Mordecai: It's totally a tie.

Benson: (groan) No! It doesn't work that way!

Mordecai: Wait, wha?

Benson: In the event of a tie the judges have to pick a winner live in front of all the contestants.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Benson: That's right, doesn't seem so easy anymore, does it?

(Benson starts to leave)

Rigby: Benson, You gotta help us!

Benson: No way! You wanted be judges, you get to be judges.

Rigby: What do we do?!

Mordecai: I don't know! I gotta think.

Benson: Here's an idea: get out there and tell everybody the truth.

(Benson leaves)

Rigby: Dude, we can't do that. Everyone's gonna hate us!

Mordecai: Well, we have to do something, if we quit Benson will fire us!

Rigby: (gasp) Dude! The pie!

Mordecai: No, we're not asking that guy for help.

Rigby: Do you wanna tell Margaret how bad her pie was?

(Mordecai stares at Rigby. We cut to darkness, Mordecai opens the lid, M&R are now consulting Promise Pie)

Promise Pie: Well, well, well, look who's come crawlin' back.

Mordecai: Can you really help us?

Promise Pie: Of course, I can. Just say the word and I'll make pickin' a winner as easy as pie.

Rigby: Okay, but can you stop talking like that? It's making me uncomfortable.

Mordecai: Yeah, me too.

Promise Pie: Oh, sure, I can use my natural voice. (Promise Pie's voice deepens to a monster-like quality) HOW'S THIS?

Rigby: Uh, probably better to go with the first voice.

Mordecai: Look, just help us judge the contest.

Promise Pie: Not a problem. (Promise Pie sprouts arms and legs) I'll call you to come out as soon as it's done. Oh, and one more thing, no matter what ya hear, don't come out 'till I say.

Mordecai: What, why?

Promise Pie: JUST DON'T COME OUT 'TILL I SAY!

Mordecai: Okay!

(Promise Pie chuckles and walks outside. Mordecai & Rigby flop on the steps to the stand outside)

Mordecai and Rigby: Phew!

Mordecai: Man, problem solved!

(Mordecai & Rigby hear screaming, they go outside)

(The world around them is a hazy red. Promise Pie is now a giant and he is eating people, he eats Starla)

Muscle Man: Babe! Gimme--

(Promise Pie eats him)

Mordecai: Promise Pie! What are you doing?!

Promise Pie: I'M NARROWING DOWN THE COMPETITION, SO IT'LL BE EASIER FOR YOU TO JUDGE.

(He picks up Margaret, he is about to eat her)

Mordecai: MARGARET! NO!

(M&R run toward Margaret, Promise Pie swats them aside and he eats Margaret, he resumes feeding. Benson runs up)

Benson: What've you done?! I knew you guys wouldn't be able to judge pies!

(Benson is grabbed by Promise Pie, he is about to be eaten, so is Pops)

Pops: Was my pie so terribly bad that you couldn't judge it?

(Pops is thrown into Promise Pie's mouth, screaming)

Rigby: POPS, NO!

Mordecai: POPS, YOUR PIE WAS ONE OF THE BEST ONES WE TASTED!

(Pops is spit out of Promise Pie's belly. Promise Pie shrinks a little)

Benson: KEEP JUDGING!

Mordecai: OKAY! UH... I GUESS STARLA'S PIE WAS KIND OF OKAY.

Benson: BE HONEST! YOU HAVE TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST!

Rigby: (frentic) ALRIGHT, FINE! STARLA, YOUR PIE WAS GRITTY AND IT TASTED LIKE A SACK OF BUTT CHEEKS!

(Muscle Man and Starla are thrown out. Promise Pie roars and throws Benson, screaming, to the ground)

Benson: It's working!

(Promise Pie runs toward them and almost crushes M&R, they jump out of the way)

Mordecai: SKIPS, NEXT TIME YOU BAKE, WEAR A HAIRNET, BRO!

(Skips is shot out, screaming)

Rigby: DEATH, THIS WAS TERRIBLE, STICK TO KILLING PEOPLE!

(Death is shot out)

Mordecai: Hey, Dude with the Pie Glasses. THE ONLY THING MORE TASTELESS THAN YOUR GLASSES WAS YOUR PIE.

(The dude with the pie glasses is shot out)

Rigby: SCABITHA, YOUR PIE WAS SOGGY, AND I FOUND A BANDAGE IN IT!

(Scabitha is shot out)

Mordecai: Margaret, your pie... UGH! Your pie... It was the worst pie I've ever seen. Somehow it was burned and raw, it tasted like barf. (Margaret is now shot out and Promise Pie has shrunk to his normal size) I'm Sorry, Margaret. Pops, your pie was the best. You're the clear winner.

Rigby: Yeah, here's your ribbon, man.

Pops: Good Show! Jolly good show! (laughs)

(Everyone, except Margaret gather around Mordecai, Rigby, and Pops. Promise Pie is on the ground, coughing.)

Promise Pie: What about me, fellas?

Mordecai: What about you? I think it's time to put you back in the trash.

(Mordecai picks him up with a shovel and throws him against the side of a garbage truck. It drives away as Benson shows up.)

Benson: MORDECAI! RIGBY!

Mordecai: Whoa! Benson, we're sorry.

Rigby: Yeah, at least we didn't give up, right?

Benson: UNBELIEVABLE!

Mordecai: Hey, man, we judged that pie contest.

Rigby: You're just mad we didn't quit, and now you can't fire us.

Benson: Oh, can't I?

Mordecai and Rigby: No, you can't.

Benson: Yeah, I guess you're right. (Benson hands M&R cleaning equipment) Clean up this mess, or you're fired!

(Benson walks out. M&R stand in silence)

Rigby: You think there's any pie left?

(The short begins with Mordecai and Rigby are playing video games, when suddenly they hear the microwave beeping, because the pizza pouches are ready. They gasp, run to the microwave and open it)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pizza pouches!

(They take the pizza pouches out, but they grunt because of how hot they are)

Mordecai: Pizza pouches in our mouth-es?

Rigby: Aw, yayuh.

(Rigby takes a bite and so does Mordecai. They feel something hard, so Rigby tears the pouch off with his hands, along with Mordecai, only to reveal a cold solid thing. It shines. They spit them out and they land on the floor. Later, Rigby inspects the pizza pouch with a fork)

Rigby: Hmmm... the top is warm, the bottom is soggy, but the inside's frozen solid.

Mordecai: Dude, (circles arms) if we could just figure out a way to cook everything evenly...

Rigby: Yeah, (circles arms) like all the way around, so heat would get into it...

Mordecai: Almost like a... (gasp)

Mordecai and Rigby: Free falling pizza pouch!

(Scene switches to Rigby and Mordecai on a skydiving plane with Jose)

Jose: OK, so what you wanna do is 

(Plane shakes)

Jose: Jose, keep it steady! (Sees the seat is empty for he is Jose) Oh yeah, Im Jose. Go go go!

(Mordecai starts the microwave and throws it out)

Mordecai: Down you go, microwave!

(Cable goes down as the microwave goes down)

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmm, hmm! (They jump off) WOAH!

Mordecai: Whoo! (Laughs) Dude, thisll totally cook them all the way through!

Rigby: I know! This makes so much sense. Here comes the microwave!

Mordecai: (Grabs it) Dude, its working! (They chuckle happily then Mordecai checks theyre nearby the ground) Uh, are they done yet?

Rigby: (Checks if theyre done yet) No, not yet!

Mordecai: (Panickly) Uuuuuh Were getting really close to the ground.

Rigby (Angrily): They not done yet!!

(Backpack beeps)

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta pull our chutes!

Rigby: 10 MORE SECONDS!

Mordecai (Quickly): Dude, hurry up!!

(Timer hits 0:00)

Rigby: Done!

(The cable cuts as the microwave reaches its limit. The duo scream then activate the parachutes. The Microwave then explodes)

Mordecai: Where is it?

Rigby: There.

(After the explosion, the pizza pouches are still in place)

Mordecai & Rigby (Cheering): WOOOOOOOH!! (Takes a bite then screams for it is really hot!)

(End of "Pizza Pouch Drop")


(Episode opens with Pops's House. Mordecai is brushing his teeth. Rigby is standing at the door.)

Rigby: Look, you know I couldn't be happier that you didn't back down from going on this date with CJ. I admire that. But tonight we had plans! Man plans! Man's!

Mordecai: (Turns to look at Rigby) I know, I know, but this is important. And I told you I was sorry.

Rigby: Yeah, well, sorry doesn't help me eat pizza and prank call Benson. 

Mordecai: But we do this every Saturday; I'm only missing it once.

Rigby: (Points at Mordecai) You know this is a two man job. 

Mordecai: (But Mordecai wasn't listening, and goes back to brushing his teeth) I'm not hanging out with you tonight, dude.

Rigby: Uuuuuuuuuuuuugh! (He dramatically throws his arms up and spins out of the bathroom.)

(A clock transition reveals that it is later in the day. CJ is standing outside waiting for Mordecai. Mordecai opens the front door.)

CJ: Hey!

Mordecai: Hi, hey! So, um, I'm glad you could make it out tonight. (He gives CJ a hug.)

CJ: (Chuckles) Woah! You're a real move maker today.

Mordecai: Oh, uh... I mean... I thought...

CJ: Hey, hey, I'm just teasing! It's cool. You already got me on a date, there's no need to impress me.

Mordecai: (Blushes) Ha, yeah, it's cool. I'm cool.

CJ: Pfft. Alright, cool guy. What are we doing on this hot date?

Mordecai: Well, we could go eat at the new falafel fusion truck, or there's the tried-and-true Wing Kingdom, and then after that I was thinking we could (Begins to count off on his fingers) go catch a movie, or go to trivia night at the arcade, or take a chance on disco night down at that weird bingo hall.

CJ: Yeah, sounds good.

Mordecai: Uh... which one?

CJ: All of 'em. Let's just start at the beginning and see how far we get.

Mordecai: Okay.

(They begin to walk away when all of a sudden, a ghostly green light appears, along with a portal that has spirits flying out of it. A van drives out of the portal, revealing Death and his wife, who appears to be yelling at him about something. Death then appears to be trying to reason with her. The camera focuses back on Mordecai and CJ.)

CJ: Uh... (Points) that van just came out of thin air.

Mordecai: We should go.

(He tries to quickly walk off with CJ)

CJ: (Still pointing) Do you know them?

Mordecai: Nope.

Death: Hold it right there!

(A door is heard opening, and Death walks over to Mordecai and CJ before they can get away.)

Mordecai: (Nervously waves) Ha ha. Hey, Death. How's it going?

CJ: (Looks at Mordecai) Uh... Death?

Mordecai: (Motions to Death) CJ, this is Death. (Motions to CJ) Death, CJ.

Death: Charmed.

Mordecai: Well, it's been great running into you. (He tries to leave again.)

Death: Oh, we're not through yet. (He gestures over to his van) You're gonna babysit Thomas tonight.

(He uses magic to open one of the van's doors. Thomas is seen sitting in his baby seat with a grumpy expression on his face.)

Mordecai: Aw, man!

CJ: (Puts up her hands in defense) Um, actually, we were just about to head out ourselves.

Death: Well, you're in for a change of plans, missy, because (He points at Mordecai) this joker owes me a favor. 

Mordecai: (He quickly glances over at CJ before coming up with a plan) Hold on a second. 

(He walks a few feet away and dials somebody's number. Rigby is heard answering the phone.)

Rigby: Yeah?

Mordecai: Dude, I need you to do me a huge favor and babysit Thomas tonight.

(The camera shows Rigby sitting on somebody's couch, sporting a rather confused expression.)

Rigby: Isn't he like, in college?

(The camera goes back to Mordecai again.)

Mordecai: Not that Thomas, Death's Thomas! Can you help me out?

(The camera switches back to Rigby.)

Rigby: Sorry to hear that, but I've got some important plans that I can't cancel on!

(Just then, Eileen walks over to him.)

Eileen: Sorry we have to watch it on my computer. (She sits down on the couch beside Rigby) I haven't had a T.V. since I moved out of my parents' place.

(The camera then switches back to Mordecai, who appears to be shocked.)

Mordecai: Are you at Eileen's?!

(Rigby suddenly shouts back at him over the phone.)

Rigby: VERY IMPORTANT!!

(Mordecai cringes and lowers the phone. He groans in annoyance and then proceeds to walks back over to CJ and Death.)

Mordecai: Sorry, CJ. Looks like I can't get out of this.

CJ: We don't have to give up on our date just because of Thomas. 

Mordecai: Really?

CJ: Yeah! I'll just help you babysit him. I'm sure we can still have a good time.

Mordecai: Okay. Let's do it!

(Death walks back over with Thomas in his arms.)

Death: Glad to hear it. We'll pick him up at eight. (He suddenly remembers something) Oh, a little heads up. (Whispers to Mordecai) Thomas is going through a little bit of a phase right now.

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Death: Ciao! 

(He walks back over to his van and drives away, disappearing through another portal.)

Thomas: So. Mordecai.. we meet again.

CJ: Woah, he can talk?

Thomas: Obviously.

Mordecai: (He puts Thomas down on the ground) Yeah, he's actually three hundred years old.

CJ: Then why is he so shrimpy?

Thomas: (Gestures angrily at CJ) Who is this female?

Mordecai: (He points at Thomas) Her name's CJ, and you're messing with our date plans, so try to be nice, okay?

Thomas: Date?

 Mordecai:  Uh, yeah.

Thomas: And she's actually okay with being a girlfriend to someone like you?

Mordecai: (Blushes and rubs the back of his neck) Well, she's not really my girlfriend yet. 

(The camera pans over to CJ, who's blushing and smiling as well.)

Mordecai (continued): Uh, we're just on a date right now-

Thomas: (Interrupting) Gah! Such simple minds! You mortals have the most tedious rituals.

CJ: Hey, at least we're not three hundred and still wearing baby clothes.

Thomas: What?! How dare you. 

(His eyes begin to flash a bright red color. This stops as soon as Mordecai addresses him, however.)

Mordecai: So, Thomas, what do you want to do?

Thomas: (Points at Mordecai) Take me to the playground!

CJ: Hey, not a bad idea. This could be pretty fun.

Thomas: (Angrily) Oh, we'll see about that.

(A clock transition shows little kids having fun on a playground. The camera pans over as a young boy goes down a slide and lands flat on his face in the sand below.)

Thomas: Where have you taken me?

CJ: It's a playground, dude.

Mordecai: Yeah, go run around or something.

Thomas: But where's the fire? The brimstone? The overall loss of hope?

(The camera shows a depressed man sitting on a park bench)

Mordecai: I don't know. That guy on the bench looks kind of sad.

Thomas: (Crosses his arms) Take me to the underworld playground.

(A stout, little kid walks over to Thomas. Thomas pushes him over, and the kid falls on his back, his arms and legs twitching.)

CJ: You haven't tried it out yet. Give it a chance!

Mordecai: Come on, I'll push you on the swings.

(They begin to walk towards the playground, the little boy's limbs still twitching in the background. Thomas complains loudly.)

Thomas: Daaaah! Gaaaaaaah!

(The camera shows Thomas getting pushed back and forth on a swing. He looks grumpier than before.)

Thomas: This is terrible! The swings in the underworld go much higher!

(Mordecai continues to push Thomas, despite this remark.)

Mordecai: Well, too bad.

(He turns when he hears music coming from an ice cream truck. The ice cream man is shown giving a little kid some ice cream.)

Mordecai (continued): (Whispers to CJ) Follow my lead.

CJ: (Giggles) Okay.

Mordecai: Alright. I'm gonna push you really high this time! (He pushes Thomas with all his might)

Thomas: Now that's a good swing! Keep this up and I'll... (He realizes Mordecai and CJ are gone) Wait. What the...?

(The camera switches over to Mordecai and CJ, who just received a cone of vanilla ice cream from the ice cream man. Mordecai holds the cone out to CJ.)

Mordecai: Wanna share?

CJ: Yeah, sure.

(They both go to hold onto the cone, causing their hands to touch. They smile at each other before being rudely interrupted by Thomas.)

Thomas: Fools! You can't leave me alone! You are here to do my bidding! Now take me to the underworld playground.

(Mordecai and CJ look at each other.)

Mordecai: We can't. Just play on this playground.

(All of a sudden, Thomas lets out a cry of frustration. His eyes begin to glow red again, causing the big ice cream cone decoy on top of the ice cream truck to explode. The ice cream man runs for cover. Mordecai yells in surprise as the ice cream cone he bought for him and CJ melts all over his hand.) 

Thomas: (Chanting) Underworld. Underworld!

Mordecai: (Who screams to be heard over Thomas) I'd take you but I don't even know how to get there!

(Thomas immediately stops throwing his tantrum and smiles.)

Thomas: I know how.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, CJ, and Thomas being dropped off at Death's house via taxi. They are then shown in Death's garage as Thomas flicks on the light and presents something to Mordecai and CJ.)

Thomas (continued): This is how.

Mordecai: Dude, we can't all fit on that bike.

Thomas: Not that bike. (He points to another bike with a side car) That bike.

Mordecai: Great, but I still don't know how to ride a motorcycle.

CJ: (Turns to Mordecai) I have a motorcycle license.

Thomas: Then it's decided. The female you're trying to impress will drive us. How emasculating.

(CJ then proceeds to put on a biker jacket. Mordecai puts a helmet on Thomas's head, which makes him frown in protest. They are all then seen sitting on the motorcycle, Mordecai and Thomas in the side car and CJ on the motorcycle itself. She revs it up and begins to drive off.)

Mordecai: It's pretty cool you know how to ride a motorcycle.

CJ: Yeah, I did motocross when I was younger.

Thomas: Enough! Take a left up ahead and go into seventh gear.

CJ: Seventh gear?

Thomas: DO IT!

CJ: Okay, okay.

(She puts the motorcycle into seventh gear. The green headlights come on, which ironically are in place of a skull's eye sockets. A portal appears in front of them, and CJ screams in terror. They are immediately transported to the underworld playground.) 

Mordecai: (Nonchalantly) You get used to it.

Thomas: Ah. (He takes his helmet off) At last!

(The camera shows a playground that is surrounded by fire. It then pans around to show three evil looking spring toy animals and a sandbox with an eel-like monster it. The eel-like monster proceeds to eat a crow.)

CJ: (Shudders) Ughhh. This playground doesn't look very safe.

Mordecai: (Points) You wanna go sit down on those swings? I don't think they'll incinerate us.

CJ: (Shrugs) Sure.
(They walk over to a set of swings, which are composed of wood and bones for handles. Mordecai appears to be slightly disgusted. CJ doesn't really seem to mind, however, and sits down before Mordecai does.)

CJ: Wow. Look at him go.

Mordecai: Yeah. He's really in his element.

(The camera shows Thomas feeding the eel monster another crow.)

(The camera then switches back over to Mordecai and CJ. CJ starts to swing back and forth, while Mordecai sighs and awkwardly climbs up onto his swing, making CJ giggle.)

Mordecai: Hey, thanks for coming along and helping me. I don't know a lot of people who'd do that.

CJ: Well, it's no disco night at the bingo hall, but I'm having a lot of fun hanging out with you.

Mordecai: Really?

(He sits down on his swing, and CJ bumps into him playfully.)

CJ: Yeah, really.

(They both start to laugh. CJ grabs onto one of his swing's handles, pulling him closer.)

CJ (continued): You know, I think this date is going pretty good.

(She smiles at Mordecai, and he smiles back. They lean in to kiss each other, when suddenly, Thomas appears out of nowhere. Mordecai screams in surprise.)

Thomas: Push me!

Mordecai: Uh, yeah. (He gets out of his swing) Here you go.

Thomas: Don't patronize me. These are baby swings. I wish to go on the elder boy swings.

(A much scarier set of swings is shown, complete with skulls, spiky poles holding them up, and a cauldron of fire at the top.) 

Mordecai: (Gulps) Sure.

(He begins to walk away with Thomas.)

CJ: I'll meet you guys there. I gotta hit the restroom. (The camera zooms in on her serious expression) I'll scream if I need you.

Mordecai: Got it.

(Mordecai and Thomas continue to walk over to the elder boy swings, where a praying mantis lady is now pushing her child. Thomas chuckles at something, and Mordecai suddenly grows suspicious.)

Mordecai (continued): What's so funny?

Thomas: Hmmph. You and that female babysitter are never going to connect. 

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

Thomas: Oh, it's been so easy to get between you all day. What a pitiful romance. I've barely been able to keep a straight face.

Mordecai: What the... you've been trying to get between us?!

Thomas: Trying? (Laughs) It's been as effortless as it's been entertaining.

Mordecai: Ugh. You little jerk. (He points at Thomas) That's it, we're going home.

Thomas: Oh, we'll see about that.

(He begins to shout so that the praying mantis lady can hear him, as well as anyone else who might be on the playground.)

Thomas (continued): What? No! I will not ask this woman for her phone number! 

Mordecai: Huh?

(The praying mantis lady looks over at them)

Thomas: She's obviously married! I can't believe you're asking me to pick up women for you while your date is in the bathroom!

(The camera shows a Cerberus mother sitting on a bench, reading a book while her child plays with a toy truck. She looks up in disgust.)

Cerberus Mom: Did you hear that? How awful!

(The camera then shows a serpent, whose child is sitting beside him.)

Serpent Dad: Ugh. Who would do such a thing?

(CJ walks back over to Mordecai and Thomas, unaware of what is happening)

CJ: Hey you guys, what's going on here?

Mordecai: (Laughs nervously) Not much. We should probably get out of here.

(Before they can do that, however, a shadow looms over Mordecai.)

Anonymous: Hey, buddy!

(Mordecai turns around. The camera pans up to show a Minotaur, who is wearing a rather angry expression.)

Minotaur: Are you trying to pick up my wife? Well?

Mordecai: (Waves his hands frantically) No, no! I'm just the babysitter!

Minotaur: What kind of sicko uses a child to try to pick up a married woman?

(The praying mantis lady responds to him in some weird form of insect gibberish)

Mordecai: Look, it's not really like that. I'd never go after your wife, honest!

Minotaur: Oh? So now my wife isn't good enough? You think she's revolting just because she's pregnant with hundruplets?! 

(The Cerberus mom begins to walk over, growling menacingly.)

CJ: We need to get out of here!

(The Minotaur begins to roar as well. Mordecai grabs Thomas and takes CJ's hand.)

Mordecai: Come on!

(They leap onto one of the elder boy swings, swinging over a seemingly bottomless abyss that lies below. They land roughly and begin sliding on the ground. They quickly get up and run away as the playground monsters pursue them.)

CJ: We've got to get to the bike!

(One of the spring toys narrowly misses hitting CJ. The Minotaur is then shown throwing another one, which lands right in front of them and causes them to be blown back. Mordecai looks up worriedly as they hit the ground.)

Mordecai: CJ!

(CJ grabs her leg, which appears to be hurt from the fall. Mordecai quickly runs over to her with Thomas as the third and final spring toy is thrown at them. He helps her up, and they run over to the motorcycle. )

CJ: Wait! (Mordecai looks up as he puts Thomas in the side car) I can't drive! My ankle is messed up.

Mordecai: Uh, okay. Then get in the side car!

(She hops into the side car with Thomas. Thomas puts on a helmet and she does the same. Mordecai puts one on as well and gets on the motorcycle.)

Mordecai (continued): Tell me how to start it!

(The serpent father roars and throws a sharp boulder at them. They cover their faces as debris scatters everywhere.)

CJ: Uh... turn the key!

(He turns the key, the camera zooming in on him as he does so. The motorcycle immediately starts up.)

CJ (continued): On three, let the clutch out slowly. THREE!

(Despite CJ's warning, Mordecai quickly pulls out and almost drives right into a boulder. The playground monsters quickly chase after them in hot pursuit. Mordecai swerves and catches a glimpse of the monsters behind him.)

Mordecai: We're not going fast enough! 

CJ: Get out of first gear! 

(Mordecai tries to do what she says, but he only ends up stalling the motorcycle instead.)

Mordecai: Huh?

(They get yanked back towards the monsters.)

CJ: You stalled it! Turn it back on!

Mordecai: I thought you said this was easy.

CJ: (Puts a hand to her head) Ugh, I was just trying to look cool!

(Mordecai revs the motorcycle and smiles as it starts back up. He continues to drive forward as the monsters follow close behind.)

Thomas: Can't this thing go any faster? 

Mordecai: This is all your fault! You make it go faster!

CJ: I know a way to go faster. 

Mordecai: Really?

CJ: Yeah, we just need to get rid of some dead weight. 

(The monsters are seen behind them again.)

Thomas: Well then, hurry up!

CJ: My pleasure!

(She holds Thomas over the edge of the side car, acting like she's going to drop him.)

Thomas: What? No! (He frantically kicks his feet) Stop this at once!

CJ: Oh, yeah? Why should I? This whole time you've been trying to get between me and Mordecai. 

Thomas: No! No I... t-that doesn't sound like me!

Mordecai: Yeah, right. You told me so yourself!

CJ: I've been looking forward to this date for a long time, and I'm sick of you messing it up!

(Mordecai looks over in awe and smiles.)

CJ (continued): Well, out you go!

Thomas: No! Pull me in! (Flails his arms and legs) PULL ME IN! (He screams.)

(The force of his screams causes a miniature abyss to open up in front of the monsters. A boulder falls in, causing molten lava to splash up and cover the serpent. The Cerberus and praying mantis lady are caught off guard and ram right into a boulder. The Minotaur is the only one remaining. Mordecai manages to hop over a chasm and get himself, Thomas, and CJ to safety. The Minotaur snorts and tries to make the jump as well, but only manages to fall to his death in the chasm.)

Minotaur: (As he's falling) No! I'm the victim here! You're the one who hit on my wife! I was just playing with my kids! (He finally hits the bottom of the chasm.)

(The camera switches back to Mordecai, CJ, and Thomas. Thomas opens his eyes when he realizes that they are no longer in danger.)

Thomas: Huh?

CJ: We totally tricked Thomas into thinking we were gonna drop him!

(Mordecai and CJ do a trademark 'OOOOH!' and high five.)

CJ (continued): Let's get out of here.

(Mordecai shifts into seventh gear, and another portal appears in front of them.)

Thomas: (Whining) Being tricked is one of my least favorite things!

(He begins to throw a tantrum inside the portal, causing the motorcycle to spin and turn upside down. They exit the portal and Mordecai swerves, crashing through Death's garage door. They all land on the ground. Thomas groans and picks himself up, taking off his helmet in the process. He then begins to laugh.)

Thomas (continued): When I tell my daddy what you've done, he'll torture your souls for all eternity! Good luck going on your dates then! 

(He laughs and bangs on the wall, causing a bowling ball to roll down towards him.)

CJ: Uh....

Mordecai: (He silences CJ) Shhh.... Shh... Shhh... 

(The bowling ball fall and hits Thomas right on the head, knocking him out. All of a sudden, a door is heard opening, and Death walks in.)

Death: What the... 

(The camera shows Thomas on the ground, snoring softly. Mordecai and CJ quickly stand up.)

Death (continued):  So, looks like you're two for two, Mordo. If you don't watch yourself, I'll have to enlist you as a full-time sitter. (Laughs)

Mordecai: (Nervously) Ha ha...

Death: (Pokes a finger in Mordecai's chest) Now get out of my garage!

(He walks away with Thomas and slams a door that leads to his house.)

CJ: Wait, you don't get paid?

Mordecai: Nah, he just lets us live.

CJ: Well, really I should thank you for that. I can't believe you learned how to ride a bike so fast; that was awesome!

Mordecai: Yeah, well, I was just trying to look cool.

CJ: (Playfully shoves him) Alright, alright, I can get wanting to impress your date.

Mordecai: So did it work?

CJ: He doesn't need to impress me, I already think he's cool.

Mordecai: Well, he thinks the same about her. You've really been looking forward to this for a long time?

CJ: Yeah.

(They share their first intentional kiss.)

Mordecai: Want a lift while we try to hail a cab?

CJ: Oh, please!

(Mordecai lets CJ hop onto his shoulders, and he carries her away while they share a good laugh.)

(End of Play Date)

(Episode begins with a flashback to the Park in the 1900s. A young Pops is at home with Mr. Maellard, looking at the telescope.)

()

(Episode opens with Mordecai, Rigby, Eileen, and CJ having lunch in the park.)

Eileen: Alright, Rigby. Would you rather...comb your hair with a hot dog, or have feet for hands?

Rigby: Pfft! Feet for hands! Run twice as fast!

Mordecai: But how would you play video games?

Rigby: (Gets up in Mordecai's face) Feet for hands!

CJ: Your turn, Mordecai. Would you rather...live on a houseboat made of garbage, or eat a sandwich in a portable toilet?

Mordecai: Portable toilet.

CJ: You'd really do that?

Mordecai: (Scoffs) Over a garbage houseboat, obviously. It'd smell bad, and then the water would make it smell more, and then you just got a big pile of wet garbage.

CJ: So you're saying you would eat a sandwich in a portable toilet?

Mordecai: (Points at CJ) Yes.

CJ: Huh. (Pulls a wrapped sandwich out of her bag) Just so happens I got my sandwich right here. (Gasps and points) And what's that over there?

(Mordecai looks over his shoulder to see a portable toilet behind him)

Rigby: Ooh! (Slams his hand on the table) Time to put your sandwich where your mouth is!

Mordecai: You can't be serious.

CJ: What a coincidence, my sandwich is chicken, too.

(Rigby and Eileen shout out an amused 'Ooooh!' in behalf of CJ's playful banter. Mordecai seems to inwardly groan in disbelief as CJ slides her sandwich over to him.)

Eileen: She's got you there, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Are you daring me? (He puts up his hands) 'Cause if you're gonna dare me, just dare me.

CJ: (Shrugs) Alright, I dare you.

Mordecai: Oh, so we're just changing games now. Fine, then.

(He gets up from the table and begins to walk over to the portable toilet, CJ's sandwich in hand)

CJ: (Holds out her hand) Wait!

(Mordecai turns around)

CJ (continued): How will we know if you actually do it?

Eileen: (Who stands up from her spot at the table) Right, it's not a legitimate dare without a credible witness.

(Rigby quickly jumps up from his seat)

Rigby: Fine. I'll be the incredible witness! 

(He begins to walk away. Eileen sits back down, and CJ grabs a water bottle out of her bag.)

Eileen: (Turns to CJ) So.... were you planning that the whole time, or...

(CJ twists the cap off of her water bottle as Eileen says this)

CJ: Nah. It was more of an impulse.

(She takes a sip of her water. Meanwhile, Rigby is seen opening the door to the portable toilet, and he and Mordecai step inside. Rigby closes the door behind them and switches the sign from vacant to occupied.) 

Mordecai: (Looking around) Huh. I gotta say, this is pretty classy.

Rigby: I guess if I needed to go outside I'd do it here. So you're really going through with this?

(As Rigby continues speaking, Mordecai sits down on the toilet)

Rigby (continued): I can just vouch for you, ya know. It's no big deal.

Mordecai: (While eating the sandwich) I'm a man of my word. (Chewing) So, CJ and Eileen seem to be getting along.

Rigby: Yeah, I guess.

(He pulls himself up so that he can look out the window. He sees CJ and Eileen talking over at the picnic table and decides to make a mockery of their conversation.)

Rigby (continued): (In a lame impression of Eileen's voice) Boy, we have so much in common. Would you rather... awkwardly kiss Mordecai on New Year's Eve, or dare him to eat a sandwich in a portable toilet? Oh wow, both?!  (He turns around to see Mordecai has finished the sandwich. He immediately goes back to using his normal voice.) Oh, you're done. 

(Mordecai swallows the last of the sandwich)

Mordecai: Easy peasy no big deezy!

(He blows into the plastic bag that held CJ's sandwich and pops it. Rigby hops down from his spot at the window.)

Rigby: Great, let's get out of here.

(He goes to open the door when he realizes that the handle is stuck)

Rigby (continued): (Turns to Mordecai) It's stuck.

Mordecai: Dude, that's not funny.

Rigby: Why would I joke about this; you know how I am with small spaces!

(He begins to panic and furiously jiggles the door handle)

Mordecai: Come on, dude. Try and calm down.

(Rigby stops trying to open the door)

Rigby: (Puts a hand to his head) Okay, I'm trying. Caaaaaaalm.

Mordecai: Good. CJ and Eileen are right out there. They'll come and get us any minute.

(The camera shows Rigby with a blank expression on his face)

Mordecai (continued): Right? Uh.... Rigby?

(Mordecai waves his hand in front of Rigby's face)

Mordecai (continued): Rigby?!

(Rigby immediately begins to act hysterical)

Rigby: (Screaming) We're gonna starve before they find us! Why'd you eat the whole sandwich? You should've saved some just in case!!

Mordecai: Dude, that makes no sense!

Rigby: (Points at Mordecai) You makes no sense!

(He begins to screech and pound on the door violently, to which Mordecai just rolls his eyes)

Rigby (continued): Help! I'm trapped in here with a crazy person!

(The camera shows the portable toilet rocking back and forth as Rigby hits it, his screams audible to anyone nearby. Meanwhile, CJ and Eileen are engrossed in a deep conversation.)

Eileen: I think the character I love to hate the most is King Harry. He's such a pill.

(Both girls look up as they hear a loud noise)

CJ: Huh?

(Rigby continues to pound on the door violently, and the girls walk over to the portable toilet) 

CJ: Hey guys! How's it going in there?

Mordecai: Well, things are going fine. The sandwich is done. But, uh, now it's kinda...

Rigby: The door is stuck. Get us out of here!

CJ: (Sarcastically) Oh, that's terrible.

(CJ and Eileen snicker) 

CJ: Do you need some...oh, what is the word I'm looking for?

Eileen: It's on the tip of my tongue. Help?

CJ: Oh, yeah...help or something?

Rigby: Yes! Could you please help us?

CJ: I guess we could try.

(CJ attempts to open the door. She pulls on the door's handle, but it refuses to open.) 

CJ: Oh. It really is stuck.

(Rigby begins to scream again) 

Eileen: I knew I should've brought my keysmith multi-tool today. Never doubt your gut, Eileen.

Mordecai: There's some tools in the garage.

CJ: All right. Hold tight. Don't run out of oxygen in there!

(The girls laugh and begin to walk away)

Eileen: I get that you're joking, but actually, portable toilets are quite well-ventilated.

Mordecai: This thing is brand-new. How did the handle get stuck like... wha...oh!

(Mordecai pulls his hand back, revealing some kind of a brown sauce sticking to his fingers)

Mordecai (continuned): What is this stuff?

Rigby: That's meatball gravy.

Mordecai: How did meatball gravy get on the doorknob, Rigby?

Rigby: I was eating meatballs!

Mordecai: You're not supposed to eat meatballs with your hands, dude.

Rigby: Hands are nature's forks!

Mordecai: Try the window or something.

(Rigby jumps up to the window)

Rigby: I can't even get my fingers through the holes. They're like tiny prison bars.

Mordecai: All right. Option two: let's ram the door.

(Mordecai and Rigby ram the door, which leads to them knocking over the portable toilet that they're in. A flowerpot hits Mordecai on the head and knocks him out. ) 

(Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are walking in The Park) 

Muscle Man: So, what are you doing tonight?

High Five Ghost: I got to house-sit my cousin's dog. What about you?

Muscle Man: That on-target 1.2 combination model's been singing my name all week.

High Five Ghost: Oh. They finally installed that new outhouse?

Muscle Man: Show some respect, bro. It's called a "portable toilet".

High Five Ghost: Okay. Well, that sounds like fun. Have a good weekend.

Muscle Man: Oh, I will, bro. I will. I'm yours now, baby.

(Muscle Man sees the portable toilet knocked over) 

Muscle Man: What?! No! This is not okay.

(Muscle Man pulls out his cellphone and dials a number)

Muscle Man: Yeah. It's Muscle Man. We got a code sixty seven over here.

(A helicopter comes in and replaces the knocked down portable toilet with a new one) 

Muscle Man: Make sure she gets a good home!

Helicopter Pilot: She will! Decommissioned units get sent to the military for target practice.

Muscle Man: That's so honorable!

(The helicopter flies off with the old portable toilet. Muscle Man now goes into the new portable toilet.)

(Later, Eileen and CJ show up at the portable toilet. Eileen pulls out a hammer from the tool box and begins to bang it against the door's handle.) 

Eileen: Alright...first, we'll test the...

(The door opens, revealing Muscle Man to be in the portable toilet. He is wearing a bathrobe and is surrounded by candles. Relaxing music is heard playing in the background.) 

Muscle Man: Eileen! Uh... Second girl. This is not awkward.

Eileen: Okay...

Muscle Man: I said it's not awkward! (Sighs) Listen, ladies, I know this model was voted throne of the year by Flush Twice Quarterly, but you're gonna have to wait your turn.

CJ: Mordecai and Rigby were locked in here. Do you know where they went?

Muscle Man: Uh... Okay. Yep. Well...this is awkward.

(A clock transition shows the helicopter flying away with the portable toilet. We cut to the inside of the portable toilet, where Mordecai and Rigby are lying unconscious. Rigby's phone then begins to ring, causing him to wake up and answer it.)

Rigby: (Groggily) Hello?

(CJ is heard responding on the other end)

CJ: Where are you guys?

Rigby: Let me check.

(He glances out of the window and begins to scream hysterically. The camera then switches over to CJ, who backs away from the phone after hearing Rigby screech like a banshee. Eileen quietly listens in on the conversation.)

CJ: Try and sit tight. Muscle Man is dealing with it. (Quizzically) He says he knows a guy?

(CJ and Eileen turn to look at Muscle Man, who is pacing around in front of the new portable toilet. He is on his phone trying to get ahold of somebody, but to no avail.)

Muscle Man: (Annoyed) Weak, I got the automated system.

(He starts pacing again as the electronic voice begins speaking)

Automated System: For toilet replacement, press one.

Muscle Man: (Firmly) No. Undo replacement!

(He continues to pace around angrily)

Automated System: You have selected toilet replacement.

Muscle Man: (Who is even angrier than before) NO!!

(He throws his free arm up in exasperation and indignantly shakes it at the sky)

Automated System: This is your second replacement today.

Muscle Man: (Heatedly) Put me through to the MILITARY!

Automated System: Thank you for calling On-Target. Goodbye.

(A hang up sound is heard. Muscle Man throws his arms up, officially defeated.)

Muscle Man: Aaaaaaah! Ah!

(He punches the new portable toilet in frustration. He then turns to look over at the girls.)

Muscle Man (continued): It didn't work. 

CJ: (On the phone) Where are you now?

(The camera switches back over to Mordecai and Rigby in the portable toilet. Mordecai is still unconscious, while Rigby is patiently awaiting CJ's question.)

Rigby: Uh... (He crawls over to the window and nervously peers outside) Uh....

(He sees a bunch of craters in the ground below)

Rigby: It looks like the moon! (Turns away dramatically) A horrifying moon of death! Do you know where that is?

(The camera switches back over to CJ, who appears to be extremely confused)

CJ: What?

(The camera immediately switches back over to Rigby)

Rigby: Hold on a second.

(A loud sound is heard, and the portable toilet shakes along with it. Mordecai finally wakes up, albeit in a very disoriented manner.)

Mordecai: Huh? Whaaa? (He sits up) What's happening?

(All of a sudden, the portable toilet is flipped right-side up. Mordecai and Rigby cry out in surprise as they plummet to the bottom of the structure. The camera then switches back over to CJ, who is looking at her phone in concern. Eileen rushes over to see what's the matter.)

CJ: Are you guys alright?

(Mordecai and Rigby are finally able to stand)

Mordecai: I think we're landing!

Rigby: It looks like...(Toilet lands among other toilets) a State Fair.

Mordecai: What? (On the phone) No, dude! It's a military base!

Rigby: (On the phone) How should I know? I've never been to a military base!

Mordecai: (On the phone) You've never been to a State Fair, either.

Muscle Man: Uh-oh. Okay, ladies. Now don't go whacko on me, but sometimes, the military uses decommissioned toilets for target practice.

CJ and Eileen: What?!

(The camera quickly switches back over to the military base. It zooms in on a sign that says 'keep out', and then proceeds to pan overtop all of the portable toilets. A covert building is then shown sitting atop a hill. The camera then reveals the inside of the building, which shows a man furiously typing away on a keyboard. Someone else is heard talking on the phone, as well.)

General: Mmm...mmm, yes. Mhm, agreed. 

(As the general is talking, the camera switches over to another man, who is viewing footage of the portable toilets. It then switches back over to the man who was first seen typing on his computer. He appears to be staring intently at a screen, as well. The camera finally reveals the general, who has his back turned as he continues to speak on the phone.)

General: (continued): Will do, sir.

(He hangs up the phone)

General (continued): Begin test phase of the F29 disintegrator laser system.

(One of the corporals swivels in his seat)

Corporal: Permission to speak freely, sir?

General: No.

(He turns towards the other corporal, who shifts in his seat as well)

Corporal #2: Permission to speak freely, sir?

General: Granted.

Corporal #2: Sir, why do we test the satellite laser on portable toilets, sir?

General: (Turns to face the corporal) Why do we test on portable toilets? (He walks over to the corporal) We need to be able to stop the enemies at a moment's notice. Enemies and portable toilets have two things in common: they're both soulless- (He gets up in the corporal's face)-and they're about the same size.

Corporal #2: Can never be too safe, sir.

General: You better believe it. (Begins walking away) Now I do not feel like being intimidated today, so let's put some taxpayer money to good use! Begin laser sequence!

(Multiple buttons are pressed and switches are flipped. A lever is raised up, causing the satelite laser to power up. General and Coperal #2 insert keys into the sockets.)

General: 3...2...1. Let's drop a laser-guided number two on this duke bucket.

(They turn the keys, and the satelite laser shines down on one of the portable toilets. It then shoots a laser at the toilet, obliterating it. Mordecai and Rigby witness this, and a shock wave rushes at them.)

Rigby: (On walkie talkie) Hurry up and help us!

(The shock wave passes through a tower)

Mordecai: You guys gotta come quick! We're gonna die!

(Line cuts from the phone, causing them to lose the girls)

CJ: We lost them!

(A helicopter arrives and places a portable toilet near the other one)

Eileen: I'll try and flag them down!

(She grabs flags from her toolbox and stands on top of one of the portable toilets to signal the pilot, who is reading a book and talking. She hops down from the portable toilet.)

CJ: What's wrong?

Eileen: My signals aren't working!

CJ: No! Now what we do? (Furious) This is terrible!

Eileen: Try and keep calm.

CJ: Keep calm?! Things finally stopped being weird with Mordecai, and now he's gonna get killed, (Turns dark) and it's all because of some stupid dare which wasn't even clever.

Eileen: CJ!

(Sees the first portable toilet being grabbed by the helicopter's claw) 

Eileen (continued): Do you trust me?

CJ: Yeah.

Eileen: Would you rather: let Mordecai and Rigby get killed, or jump into that portable toilet and rescue them?

(CJ takes a deep breath, causing her to return to her normal color)

CJ: That's easy.

(They run into the portable toilet before it is carried away. Back at the military base, Rigby is trying to open the portable toilet's door.)

Rigby: I've been trying to open this for so long, I can't feel my arms. (Mockingly) Thank you, Mordecai!

Mordecai: Hey, you didn't have to close the door.

Rigby: Don't put this on me, man! I'm not the one who flirts by taking toilet dares!

Mordecai:  (shoves Rigby) Quiet!

(The two start fighting. We pan over to the helicopter taking the portable toilet. It lowers it to the ground, and Eileen and CJ run out, panting.)

General: Continue testing.

Corporal: (Looking through the screen) Oh, no. (To General) Uh, permission to speak freely, sir?

General: No.

Corporal #2: Permission to speak freely, sir?

General: Granted.

Corporal #2: Didn't the president say to limit testing because each blast costs three billion dollars?

General: The president's not my father! I'll blow up as many toilets as I like! Now, continue testing!

(Corporal #2 nods and raises the lever. Cut back to the girls.)

CJ: How much time do we have?

(Laser blasts toilet behind them)

Eileen: Uh...None!

(They jump out of the way)

CJ: They gotta be here somewhere. Come on!

(They start running)

Eileen: We need to split up!

(They do so)

CJ: Mordecai! Rigby!

(A toilet is blasted as she runs by. Cut to Eileen, who sees a rattling portable toilet. She opens it, but a random man runs out.)

Man: Thanks, lady!

(Eileen and CJ meet up again)

Eileen: Any luck?

CJ: No.

(Rigby appears through a toilet behind them, and they smile)

Rigby: We're right here!

(Mordecai and Rigby pound their bodies against the door. CJ and Eileen pull from the outside.)

Eileen: It's still stuck!

CJ: Get the tools.

General: Initiate humongous explosion signal.

(Multiple buttons are pressed and switches are flipped. Eileen grabs a crowbar from the toolbox and sticks it through the protable toilet door. CJ and Eileen pull. A corporal smashes the glass to the "Humongous Explosion Primer" lever and moves it down. The laser satellite starts spinning.)

Mordecai: We have to do it together!

General: On my mark.

Mordecai/General: 3...2...1!

(CJ and Eileen pull the door open. Mordecai and Rigby come out just as the satellite shines down on the toilet.)

Mordecai: Run!

(They run as the satellite blasts the portable toilet. There is a bright explosion. We are then shown Mordecai, Rigby, Eileen and CJ wrapped up in blankets.)

General: What were you kids thinking? You're lucky we saw your heat signatures so we could distinguish you from the debris.

Corporal #2: Sir, the president's on the line.

General: Urgggh! (Takes phone) Hello?

Mordecai: Thanks for getting us out of there, guys.

CJ: Couldn't have done it without you.

Eileen: Yeah. You guys were hitting that door pretty hard. CJ jumped into a moving helicopter.

Mordecai: Wow. Really?

CJ: Well, you know, more like a portable toilet being carried by a helicopter.

Eileen: Ain't no biggie.

CJ: We're not the ones getting stuck in portable toilets.

Mordecai: (Chuckles) Whatever. It was your bet.

CJ: Hey, Eileen, would you rather: sit here and be boring, or go play with that space laser?

CJ and Eileen: (Who lean in towards each other) Space laser!

(They walk over to the two corporals)

CJ: Hey, can we try this thing out?

Corporal: Well, I don't see why not.

Rigby: Wow. CJ's pretty cool.

Mordecai: Hah. Yeah. She is.

(CJ, Eileen and corporals laugh as they play with the space laser)

(End of Portable Toilet)

(Episode opens at the City Power Tower. Mordecai and Rigby are lifting weights, but they're actually holding ping pong paddles, because they're playing ping pong.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ping pong!

(They start playing with Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost)

Hi-Five Ghost: I got it! (He hits it with his paddle)

Muscle Man: Nice!

(Mordecai hits it with his paddle, then Muscle Man hits it with his paddle, then Rigby hits it with his paddle)

Mordecai: Oh, Rigby...

(Muscle Man tries to hit it, but missed it)

Muscle Man: Aw, come on!

Rigby: You gotta go long with the ping pong!

(The guys laugh)

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost: Ping pong! Ping pong! Ping pong! Ping Pong! (They laugh again)

(A muscular man named Dale hears them, drops the weights, wipes his face with a towel, and throws the towel on Muscle Man's face)

Muscle Man: Augh! What's your problem, bro?

Dale: Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: Oh. Hey, Dale.

Mordecai: Muscle Man, you know this guy?

Dale: Yeah, he knows me. We used to be in bodybuilding contests together.

Rigby: Really?

Dale: Yeah, he used to be hot stuff. Now he's just a hot mess! And we don't allow hot messes like you guys to play ping pong in our gym, so get outta here!

Mordecai: It's a free country, man, you can't tell us what to do.

(Dale picks up the Ping pong ball, placed it on his chest, and destroys it with his abs)

Muslce Man: You leave us alone, Dale! (He throws the towel on Dale's face)

Dale: (growls) What? Do you think you're tough now, bro? Look at you. You don't even deserve to be called Muscle Man no more, Mitch. (He closes up to Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Nobody calls me that except for my girlfriend, and also the guy at the airport who checks my driver's license, but that's besides the point, I've got more muscles now than you'll ever have.

Dale: Oh yeah?! Okay, then, the Power Tower Biceptennial is this weekend. (He points at the poster) It's the biggest bodybuilding contest around. If you can beat me, then you and your little ping pong posse can come here and play whenever you want. But until that day, I don't wanna to see any of your faces anywhere near the Power Tower! Do I make myself clear?!

Muscle Man: Oh, you're clear alright. You're clearly gonna lose to me at the Biceptennial, and me and my friends are gonna play ping pong here whenever we want!

(A clock transition changes to the guys at his trailer at the park)

Mordecai: Dude, you don't have to do this, you know.

Rigby: Dude, that guy is super ripped. There's no way you can beat him.

Mordecai: I thought the whole reason you were called Muscle Man was to be ironic, anyways.

Rigby: Yeah, 'cause you're so out of shape, you know.

Muscle Man: Hmm. How's this for out-of-shape?

(He hands Mordecai and Rigby a picture of himself with muscles at the Biceptenial)

Mordecai and Rigby: Wooaahh....

Rigby: Man, you weren't kidding.

Muscle Man: Yeah, bros. Back then, I was the real deal. I was the Muscle Man. (Flashback begins with Muscle Dad placing his camera and posing behind the City Power Tower) I really got into bodybuilding through my dad. (Scene then changes to a young Muscle Man sitting and watching Muscle Dad lifting weights) Everyday I go with him to the Power Tower and watch him lift weights. He may not had the most rip body, but he was as strong as an ox, until one day...

(Muscle Dad's arm bent and the weights lifted down on his chest)

Young Muscle Man: Muscle Dad! (He runs up to him and lifted the weights off him as muscles grew on his body which it ripped his shirt off.) What?

Bodybuilder 1: Huh?

Bodybuilder 2 and 3: Huh?

Bodybuilders: Woah, check it. It's pretty cool, man. Awesome. He's ripped.

(The body builders and Muscle Dad walk right up to Young Muscle Man)

Bodybuilder 2: Hey, kid, what happened?

Young Muscle Man: I don't know. I was just sitting over there, and my dad was lifting over here, and I lifted the weights up off of him. (He starts posing)

Bodybuilder 3: His posing is perfect.

Bodybuilder 1: Your boy's a natural, Muscle Dad.

(The bodybuilders chat, and Muscle Dad smiles at him as Young Muscle Man smiled as well)

Muscle Man: Then I was finally ready to compete in the Power Tower Biceptennial.

(Everyone cheers for him)

Muscle Man: I had it all. Muscles, technique, the total package.

(Everyone cheers again)

Chaz McAllister: The winner, Muscle Man!

(Muscle Dad smiles at him, as Muscle Man posses with his trophy)

Everyone: Muscle Man! Muscle Man! Muscle Man!

(Flashback ends and fades back to Mordecai and Rigby still holding the picture)

Muscle Man: After a while, I kept winning every match and I got bored. So I decided to step away from that whole bodybuilding scene. But now I'm ready to get back into it so I can win the Biceptennial and beat Dale. (He pulls a rope, but the tire swing and the tree fall down.) Let's go back to the Power Tower.

(A clock transition changes back to the City Power Tower. Muscle Man is doing some weights)

Hi-Five Ghost: One more! One more! (Muscle Man lifted the weights on top. Fives clapped) Let's take five.

Rigby: Dude, are you thinking what i'm thinking?

Mordecai: What? Oh, ping pong?

Rigby: Ping pong!

Mordecai: Haha, yeah. Wait, what if Dale's here.

Rigby: It's just one quick game.

Mordecai: Okay, but let's hurry before he sees us.

(He and Rigby go to the ping pong table and start playing. Mordecai tries to hit it to Rigby, but Dale destroys it with his abs again while dust falls on the table)

Dale: Go ahead, keep playing.

Mordecai: Really?

Dale: Yeah, keep playing.

(Mordecai picks up another ball and tries to hit it to Rigby again, but Dale destroys it again with his back abs)

Dale: Keep playing!

Mordecai: But we barely have any...

Dale: Come on!

(Mordecai picks up another ball and tries to hit it to Rigby again, but Dale destroys it again with his legs. Mordecai screams)

Dale: What's up?

Muscle Man: What did I say, Dale, huh?! Leave us alone!

Dale: I told you guys not to come here, Mitch!

Muscle Man: I told you not to call me that!

Dale: (bump chests Muscle Man) You wanna go?!

Muscle Man: (bump chests Dale) Yeah! Let's go right now!

(They took off their shirts and stars flexing, but Fives and the bodybuilders break up the fight)

Hi-Five Ghost: Alright, alright, break it up!

Dale: You don't stand a chance, Mitch!

Muscle Man: Whatever, man, you're so going down! Aaaahhhh! I got to face facts, I'll never be able to get buff in time for the Biceptennial.

(Mordecai, Rigby and Hi-Five Ghost look at each other.)

Muscle Man: There's only one way to beat him....technique.

(Scene cuts back to Muscle Man's trailer in a montage of Muscle Man doing instructions of flexing his muscles in different VHS recordings of the Biceptennial until the montage ends)

Muscle Man: Augh! This is hopeless! I'll never gonna win the Biceptennial! (He flips the table and a box of VHS tapes on the ground until a red VHS tape case fells out of the box) Huh? What's this? (He picks up a VHS tape that saids "For Muscle Son Love, Muscle Dad" opens it picks up a note which Muscle Dad wrote and his thought bubble of Muscle Dad writing the note appears as he reads.)

Muscle Dad: (voice-over) Son, if you're reading this, I've passed away and you're about to enter the Power Tower Biceptennail, which you need to win so you can beat some jerk and let your friends play ping pong. This takes a gains a pose that will guarantee victory, or very painful death. Good luck, son, I believe in you. Love, Muscle Dad.

(His thought bubble disappears, then Mordecai, Rigby and Hi-Five Ghost went into Muscle Man's trailer)

Mordecai: Muscle Man? Hey, Muscle Man, are you ready...?

Muscle Man: Shhh. My ghost dad sent me this ghost tape from beyond the grave. It's gonna help me win the contest.

(The guys watch a clip from the 1976 Power Tower Biceptennial)

Chaz: Up next, in the '76 Power Tower Biceptennial is reigning champion, Don Denunzio!

Muscle Man: Oh, my dad told me about this guy!

Chaz: Denunzio will finish off with the Shredder!

Judge: Remind me again what the Shredder is, Chaz.

Chaz: The Shredder has two meanings. For one, if done correctly, it shreds all of the competition. Two, if you falter in the slightest, it will literally shred all of your muscles, leading of course to an instant angonizing death.

Judge: Talk about a double-edged sword.

Chaz: Oh, he's going behind the head for the hand clasp. I think he's gonna do it! I think he's...

(When Don misses the hands, he explodes and then a colorful Please Stand By sign appeared. Mordecai, Rigby and Hi-Five Ghost, except for Muscle Man are shocked)

Muscle Man: Easy! Don't worry, bros, I totally got this.

Mordecai: What?! Are you crazy?

Rigby: Yeah, man, don't risk your life so we can play ping pong.

Muscle Man: It's about more than just ping pong. It's about sticking up for ourselves. And if I want to win the Biceptennial, then I say it's shredding time!

(Scene cuts to the Power Tower Biceptennial. Fives shaves his hair off, puts on muscle musk, Muscle Man putting on hair gel, and putting on workout underwear)

Muscle Man: Time to win this thing.

(He and Fives go up to the stage while Mordecai and Rigby are sitting on a couch, looking shocked about the Shredder)

Chaz: This is Chaz McAllister, coming to you live from the Power Tower Biceptennial. 

Judge #3: Next up to the stage, we have Dale the Daletard Decico! (Everyone cheers as he comes on stage. He hi fives a bodybuider.) And making his return, we have Muscle Man!

Man: Yeah! I remember when he was a kid, he spotted his dad! (When Muscle Man comes out, he and the guys look unhappy at his appearance.)

Mordecai: (clapping) It's okay, Muscle Man!

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, you got this, bro!

Judge #3: And we'll now be commencing the competition with the first pose: Abdominals and Thighs!

(All the bodybuilders, including Muscle Man, do the pose. The crowd cheers.)

Man: Oh, man! Did you see that technique?

Judge #3: The Crab Most Muscular!

(Muscle Man flexes his breasts as the others do the pose. Everyone, including his friends, cheers. The judges are relally impressed. The bodybuilders continue posing. The fifth bodybuilder gives a double thumbs-up.)

Chaz: Hey, we got a two thumbs-up pose! (The fourth bodybuilder gives a double peace sign.) Ooh, there's a peace sign! (The judges are not pleased.) And it looks like the judges don't seem too convinced by these poses. (We see the bodybuilders giving excellent poses.)

Judge #3: Unbelievable! This is shaping up to be a true clacial styles! (raises hand) The judges have reached a decision. The two contestants moving on to the sudden death round are: Dale the Daletard Decico...

Dale: Yes!

Judge #3: ...and although his body is very very out of shape, we all agree that his technique is immaculate. Muscle Man!

Muscle Man: Yes!

(The crowd cheers, including Muscle Man's friends.)

Dale: Alright, Mitch. Time to show the world who the real Muscle Man is!

Muscle Man: Yeah! They're all gonna see that it's me!

(Dale growls and the two begin posing. Muscle Man soon begins to tire out.)

Dale: You're looking kinda tired, Mitch. Why don't you give up, and go play ping-pong with your flabby friends? Ha ha ha!

(Muscle Man starts whimpering.)

Hi-Five Ghost: We believe in you, Muscle Man. (echoes) Man. Man. Man.

(When Muscle Man hears the echoes, he starts to go for the Shredder)

Chaz: Oh, what's this? I think Muscle Man is going for the Shredder.

Rigby: (gasps) Not the Shredder!

(Muscle Man wravels himself and is about to go behind the head for the hand clasp as he's almost reaches for his hands.)

Hi-Five Ghost: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

(Muscle Man finally clasps his hands together and begins to glow. Dale stops laughing as he notices this. Muscle Man glows an even brighter light, startling the bodybuilders. His Shredder start to shred the whole competition.)

Judge #3: Perfection.

(The Shredder continues to shred.)

Guys: Woah!

(Muscle Man stops glowing as he unwravels himself. The crowd cheers for him.)

Chaz: The winner of the Power Tower Biceptennial, Muscle Man!

(The crowd cheers as he receives the Biceptennial trophy and poses. His friends join him and chant.)

Mordecai, Rigby, and High Five Ghost: Muscle Man! Muscle Man!  Muscle Man!

(Muscle Man sees some familiar ghost faces.)

Muscle Dad: You did it, son. I'm proud of ya.

Denunzio: Si, as am I. You did what I could not.

Dale: (approaching Muscle Man) Hey! I'm so sorry I doubted you bro. You always were number one, Muscle Man. (clasps hands with Muscle Man and pulls out a box) Here, these are for you guys.

Rigby: (takes box, opens it and gasps) Ping pong balls!

Mordecai: Aw, yeah! Game on!

Muscle Man: Uhh, maybe later, bros. My muscles are killing me.

(End of Power Tower)

(Episode starts with a the picture of Pops' House with Muscle Man laughing in background. We then cut to Mordecai and Rigby's bedroom where Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are taping Mordecai's bed to the ceiling)

Muscle Man: I can't wait to see the look on Mordecai's face when he finds his bed on the ceiling. He'll be like, (Mimicks Mordecai) "Oh no, where am I gonna sleep tonight?" (He and Hi Five Ghost laugh) Best prank ever!

(HFG and Muscle high five each other; Pops comes in, chasing a balloon)

Pops: Hahaha! I've got you this time, balloon.

(He touches the balloon, causing it to hit the bed; the tape rips and Mordecai's bed crashes down on Pops. He whimpers)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro!

(Pops begins to cry loudly and Benson and the others come into the room)

Benson: Pops! (Skips gets the mattress off of Pops who is severly injured) Call an ambulance, now! (Mordecai rushes to call an ambulance while Rigby, Skips and Benson comfort Pops) It's gonna be okay, Pops.

(Pops is still sobbing in pain as Muscle Man looks upset and guilty; Scene goes to outside where two paramedics are carrying a groaning, bandaged up Pops on a stretcher with a blanket over him)

Paramedic: He should fine in a few days, but he's definitely lucky to be alive. That bed could've killed him.

(The words 'killed him' echo in Muscle Man's head, making him feel worried; he runs to Pops.)

Muscle Man: Pops! Pops! Pops, I'm so sorry, bro! It was an accident!

Pops: (Groans) No worries, I'll be quite alright.

Muscle Man: No, Pops, I almost killed you, all because of my stupid prank. I swear from this day forward I will never prank again. Ever.

Paramedic: Okay. That's enough.

(Pops moans in agony as the paramedics load him into the ambulance and drive away into the distance; Muscle Man looks guilty as he trudges away slowly in shame while Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, and Benson look on)

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man, where are you going?

Muscle Man: Away, bro. I'm done with pranking forever.

(As Muscle Man rounds the hill, the others try to comprehend what just happened.)

Rigby: All right! No more pranks from Muscle Man! Up high! (Raises hand to high-five)

Benson: No Rigby, this is bad. We've got a huge problem on our hands now that Muscle Man has given up pranking.

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

(A dramatic zoom-in on Benson's apprehensive face as he reveals the truth about Muscle Man's pranks.)

Benson: Believe it or not, Muscle Man's pranks saved this park a long time ago.

(Flashback of the Park as a battlefield; Pairs of underpants are on leaning flagpoles and toilet paper strewn across flaming log cabins.)

Benson: (Voiceover) It was under siege and almost destroyed in a prank war with a rival park... (A walking stick with the rival park, East Pines, flag on it (yellow background with a green pine tree on it) suddenly slams down on a whoopee cushion, releasing a farting sound effect. The camera slides upward to show Gene holding the walking stick) They were led by their manager, Gene...

Gene: AAAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

(A huge background explosion occurs. Toilet paper rolls soar across the smoky sky as Gene's ranger troops fire water balloon blasters at Pop's house which is mostly destroyed and within it, a younger Benson and Skips in battlefield helmets and armor cowering behind a jagged wall.)

Wartime Benson: That's it, we're done for!

Benson: (voiceover) At least, I thought we were done for...

(Camera zooms out and focuses on a ridge behind the house where Hi Five Ghost and Muscle Man, with a "#1 Prankster" bandana around his head, are examining Gene's army through binoculars.)

Wartime Muscle Man: It's not over until I say it's over!

(Muscle Man then pulls a lever, triggering a catapult to launch a gigantic green water balloon labeled "MY MOM" across the Park and into the East Pines park, smashing into the trees and flooding the entire park)

Gene: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

(Flashback ends)

Benson: So Muscle Man became the ultimate weapon in ending the prank war. With him gone, there's no telling what will happen.

Mordecai: C'mon Benson, do you seriously think that guy Gene is gonna hold a grudge for that long?

(A water balloon hits Benson in the face, and a bunch of water balloons are being shot into the Park; The guys' run into the house, screaming, and Benson closes the door)

Benson: See, the prank war is not over! We have to win it, or we're all gonna die.

(The scene then cuts to Skips' garage, where the guys, minus Muscle Man and Pops, are having a meeting)

Benson: OK listen up, we're getting seriously pranked out there. We can't win this without Muscle Man, so I'm gonna convince him to come out of retirement. (Referring to the others) In the meantime, you guys need to buy us some time. Mordecai, Rigby, what do you got for me?

Mordecai: We're gonna take out their bathrooms.

Rigby: We've got jumbo rolls of plastic wrap.

Benson: Sounds promising. Skips, Hi Five Ghost.

Skips: We got expired baloney, illegal fireworks, and three good arms.

(Skips and HFG high five each other)

Benson: Good. Good. Just remember, we're dealing with pros out there so keep your eyes open. Now get out there and make this park proud.

(The park workers open the garage door, and Gene and two of his groundskeepers pull up in a East Pines van)

Gene: Oh, hey Benson, I hear Muscle Man retired from pranking. That's a real shame. Light em' up boys!

(East Pines park employees start shooting tomatoes at the guys)

Benson: Back in the garage! Back in the garage!

(They close the garage door)

Rigby: What do we do?!

Skips: Hi Five Ghost and I will draw their fire! Just get Muscle Man back!

(HFG phases through the garage while Skips breaks through the window and run away)

East Pines Employee: There they are, go go go!

(HFG and Skips head towards East Pines, while the East Pines van follows behind)

Benson: Mordecai and Rigby, head to the other park and get into pranking position. I'll call you with further instructions.

Mordecai: But what are you gonna do?

Benson: (Close up) I'm going to get Muscle Man back.

(The scene goes to inside Muscle Man's trailer, where Muscle Man is sitting on his couch and is putting his '#1 Prankster' bandanna and other pranking items into a box and stares at nothing; Benson comes into the trailer)

Benson: Muscle Man, the rival park is pranking us again. We need you!

Muscle Man: You got the wrong man, I don't do that anymore.

Benson: But we're getting destroyed!

Muscle Man: Maybe I didn't make myself clear. I don't prank anymore.

Benson: I can't believe this! You're just gonna let them destroy the park?!

Muscle Man: Whoa! Back up bro! I almost killed a man. A park, that's just land. You can replace that any day of the week, but a man's life, that's forever.

Benson: But the Park I-

Muscle Man: It's over, Benson. I'm done.

Benson: (Sighs) Thanks for nothing!

(Benson leaves the trailer, and leaves Muscle Man sitting in the dark; Scene cuts to a sign labeled 'EAST PINES', a building labeled 'RESTROOMS' is shown, and Mordecai and Rigby are hiding in a bush nearby)

Benson: (Walkie-talkie)     Mordecai, Rigby! Muscle Man's out. We're gonna have to stop this ourselves.    

Mordecai: Let's do this.

(Mordecai and Rigby head towards the restrooms and go into one of the restrooms but they get ambushed; Scene cuts to another location in East Pines where Skips and HFG are hiding in a bush nearby)

Benson: (Walkie-talkie) Skips! Come in Skips!

Skips: (To the walkie-talkie) Yeah Skips here.

Benson: (Walkie-talkie) I lost Mordecai and Rigby, you and HFG still good to go?

Skips: (To the walkie-talkie) We're on it! (Skips takes out the bologna, yells, and charges towards the rival members, throwing bologna everywhere, while HFG lights up the fireworks, throws it into the building, the fireworks explode and the groundskeepers run out and Skips is hit by tomatoes) I'm hit!

(We cut back to Pop's House, where the surrounding area and the house was covered in tomatoes; Benson is inside the house)

Benson: Skips! Come in Skips!

Skips: (Walkie-talkie) There's too many of 'em!

(Skips screams; Benson screams and takes off his hat in anger and frustration.)

Mordecai: (Walkie-talkie) Benson! Come in Benson!

Benson: Mordecai! Where are you guys?!

Mordecai: (Walkie-talkie) Right here!

(Scene shows Mordecai and Rigby outside, tarred and feathered)

Benson: Mordecai! Rigby! Get out of there now! (The duo are hit by tomatoes)

Benson: NO!

(Mordecai and Rigby are hit repeatedly by the East Pines groundskeepers and Benson goes outside rescuing Mordecai and Rigby and helps them stand up)

Mordecai: We gotta get out of here! Their pranks are too good!

(A truck filled with whoopie cushions drives toward them and the driver flips the truck to the side which creates a sonic boom that throws Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson into trees, destroys the trees and portions of the house; Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson gasp, then the van pulls up with its door pulled back, revealing Gene who is holding marbles)

Gene: Hey guys! You lost your marbles?! (Gene throws the marbles which causes Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson to slip and fall to the ground) (Laughs) Say good bye to your park, 'cause when we're done with it, there'll be nothing left!

(3 trucks full of whoopie cushions are flipped over, which knocks down more trees)

Rigby: We gotta get outta here! Somebody's gonna get hurt or killed.

Benson: I've got an idea, just hold on.

(Benson gets into the cart and drives away;Scene goes to inside Muscle Man's trailer where he's sitting on his couch and a knock is heard)

Muscle Man: What?

(Benson rolls Pops in with a wheelchair)

Pops: Ooohhh.

Muscle Man: Pops, shouldn't you be in the hospital?

Pops: Well, yes, but there are worse things going on right now. You need to start pranking again.

Muscle Man: No way, Pops! I almost killed you! I might almost kill again. 

Pops: But only your pranks can save the Park.

Muscle Man: I can't do it, Pops. (Muscle Man looks out the window to see the East Pines groundskeepers shooting whoopie cushions at the fountain, throwing toilet paper into the trees, dropping pies from air planes onto the Park, and putting purple drink mix into the pond) Their pranks aren't hurting anyone, my pranks can kill. I won't do it.

Pops: Then we've lost the war. (Takes out a gift) At least the rival park was kind enough to send me get well confectioneries.

(Pops opens the box, a boxing glove punches Pops in the face which causes him to fall off his wheelchair)

Benson and Muscle Man: Pops!

Pops: Their pranks are hurting me!! (He starts crying.)

Muscle Man: This prank war ends now! (Muscle Man shoves stuff off the box full of pranking items; gets his '#1 Prankster' bandana on, puts black combat boots on, and puts war paint on his face) If I don't make it back, tell my mom I died doing what I love. Whooo! (We see Muscle Man swing his shirt up in the air and runs outside)

Benson: I think we just won the war.

(The scene then cuts to Scene goes to the East Pines' warehouse)

Gene: (laughs) Victory is as good as ours. Soon that park will be reduced to rubble!

(Monitors show a truck full of whoopie cushions flipping over which knocks down trees; pies landing onto the ground, and the groundskeepers throwing toilet paper onto a statue of Pops; They laugh until they get pulled away and the other monitors show other groundskeepers being pulled away as well) 

Gene: What the-? (The groundskeepers scream as they get pulled away and Muscle Man's face appears on all the monitors. He gasps as the ceiling light falls down the map; Muscle Man's face pops up) Muscle Man?!

Muscle Man: The pranking ends now Gene, give up or else.

Gene: (Laughs) Give up? I'm not giving up until see your park completely destroyed!

Muscle Man: Fine, you asked for it bro.

(The room starts to shake as the building launches into space)

Gene: Muscle Man, what's going on?

Muscle Man: We're in outer space, bro. Looks like we won't be needing these walls.

(The walls break up; Gene screams as he is being pulled towards the Sun, but first, he goes through a two-headed lizard)

Muscle Man: (appears on the sun) There's no way of knowing where we're going. I think the danger must be growing. What's that warm light a glowing? Oh no, bro! It's the sun, it's set in motion! Get ready for some fun! Hope you brought your sun tan lotion!

(Muscle Man laughs as his head becomes a skull)

Gene: (Screams) Okay, okay, I'll never prank your park again, I swear, I'll stop!

(Gene screams and falls onto the floor, revealing that all of it was fake and Muscle Man stands nearby)

Gene: Huh? What? How did you do that?

Muscle Man: Easy. Mirrors, you idiot.

(Outside, 4 tall mirrors stand around the building)

Muscle Man: (off-screen) Oldest prank in the book.

(the tall mirrors then collapse. Cuts inside again)

Muscle Man: So no more pranking, right?

Gene: (Groans) Right.

Muscle Man: And you're gonna clean up all the damage you did to the Park with your lame pranks.

Gene: What? No way.

Muscle Man: Want me to bust out the mirrors again?

Gene: (scared) No, no. We'll clean, we'll clean.

(Scene goes to the Park and the East Pines groundskeepers are seen cleaning up)

Benson: It looks like we can finally put this prank war behind us. You all made this park proud today, especially you, Muscle Man. We couldn't have done it without you.

Muscle Man: Duh, bro. I'm best pranker there is! No one can stop me, I'm never retiring! (Swings his shirt in the air) Whhhhooooooooooo!!!! (Runs away) Whhhooo!! 

Benson: Alright Pops, back to the hospital.

Mordecai: Later Pops.

(Pops laughs as Benson starts wheeling Pops away and looks back at the others)

Benson: Thanks Pops, the Park really owes you for faking that boxing glove prank. I knew Muscle Man would only have pranked Gene if you pretended to be hurt.

Pops: Oh, it's quite alright. It was a jolly good show. (Laughs)

(End of Prankless)


(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby laughing when they are watching a prank call video on the computer. On the computer a phone rings)

Old Woman: Hello.

Master Prank Caller: Oh, yes, this is I'm a sure.

Old Woman: I'm a sure, who?

Master Prank Caller: I'm a sure glad I ain't Joe Mama! (Mordecai & Rigby both laugh at the prank call video) Oh, yeah! You just got pranked by the Master Prank Caller!

Rigby: The Master Prank Caller is the funniest thing on the internet, right, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Ye-e-eyah, I guess he's pretty funny. But you know what's even funnier than watching prank phone calls?

(Mordecai looks at the telephone)

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmm, hmm, hmm!

(Cuts to Pops' room. Pops is ironing his pants when the telephone rings.)

Pops: Hello?

Rigby: [On the phone, off-screen] Hello, Pops?

Pops: Yes?

(Mordecai and Rigby start snickering)

Rigby: [On the phone, off-screen] Please hold for a collect call from... JOE MAMA!!!

(Both Mordecai & Rigby laugh off-screen, and call Skips, who is seen lifting weights)

Skips: Hello?

Rigby: Hey, Skips, do you have a son named "Joe Mama"?

Skips: Excuse me?

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh again. Skips hangs up with an angry look.)

(Cuts to Benson's apartment. He is sitting in his easy chair when the phone rings)

Benson: Hello?

Mordecai: Hey, Benson, you got any books by "Joe Mama"?

Benson: Who is this? (Mordecai and Rigby laugh even harder than before. Mordecai lets go of the phone with Benson still talking)

Benson: [On the phone, off-screen] Wherever this is coming from, I will track you down and I will find you, and if it...! 

Mordecai: Oh, dude, he's still on the phone!

Rigby: HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE?!?!?!

Mordecai: HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE! H, HA, HA, HA!!!

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh their hardest and Mordecai hangs up. Rigby's eyes begin to water)

Rigby: O-O-O-h! Oh, Mordecai, we're the best prank callers ever, aren't we?

Mordecai: Yeah, second best.

Rigby: What? Uh. Did you not hear what we just did? We were hilarious!

Mordecai: Yeah, we were. But we're not number one until we do this.

(Mordecai picks up a phone book and starts shifting through pages)

Rigby: Who are you calling? (Mordecai stops shifting through pages and points to a number on the book)

Mordecai: The Master Prank Caller.

(Mordecai takes the phone)

Rigby: Holy crap.

(Mordecai is about to dial when Benson bangs the door open off-screen.)

Benson: [off-screen] HANG UP THAT PHONE! [on-screen] You think your little pranks are funny, huh? You think they're funny? Well, what do you guys think of my prank? (walking towards the phone, he pretends to think he's being called by someone) Ring, ring. Hello, what's that? Mordecai and Rigby are banned from using the house phone? Okay.

(Suddenly, Benson's face turns red. He pulls the phone from the wall and smashes it to pieces on the floor)

Benson: GOOD LUCK MAKING YOUR PRANK CALLS NOW!

(Benson then throws the remains of the phone down and slams the door on his way out)

Mordecai: Dude, let's go use Pops' phone.

(Pops' room. Pops is still on the phone and the iron is still on his pants, which are smoking)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops, can we borrow your phone?

Pops: Oh, I would, but I'm holding to talk with Joe Mama. (A pulse tone is heard from the phone) But you're welcome to use the phones under my bed.

(Mordecai and Rigby walk towards Pops' bed.)

Mordecai: Aw, cool! What kind are they? (Rigby pulls a case from under Pops' bed and opens it to find 80s brick-sized phones.)

Rigby: Aw, '80s cellphones!

Mordecai & Rigby: Cool. Thanks, Pops.

Pops: Oh, and boys... do be careful. I think they might cause brain tumors. (Dramatic music plays as Pops turns back to the phone and then his head starts to throb. Mordecai and Rigby exchange knowing glances.)

(Cuts to the park. Mordecai and Rigby wrap foil around their heads)

Rigby: Alright. Now let's prank the Master Prank Caller.

Mordecai: Okay, here I go. (Mordecai dials the phone and the telephone rings. The Master Prank Caller picks up to answer.)

Master Prank Caller: Hello?

Mordecai: Yeah, this is, uh, pizza delivery guy? I have 50 pizzas here that you ordered. (Mordecai and Rigby snicker)

Master Prank Caller: Sounds great. Bring 'em over.

Mordecai: Uh, you ordered 50 pizzas?

Master Prank Caller: Yeah, and hot wings. Get here quick, okay? Your mom's like totally starving.

Mordecai: Yeah, uh, okay. I gotta go. (Mordecai hangs up the phone)

Rigby: Let me take a crack at it. (Rigby dials and the telephone rings again)

Master Prank Caller: Hello?

Rigby: (Idiotic voice) Hi, this is Stan.

Master Prank Caller: Stan who?

Rigby: Uh... Stan... (Normal voice) Stanminson.

Master Prank Caller: Your name is Stan Stanminson?

Rigby: Uh... yep.

Master Prank Caller: Well, congrats. That's the stupidest fake name I've ever heard. And what happened to your unfunny fake voice?

Rigby: I don't know.

Master Prank Caller: Now listen up, stop calling here or I'm gonna make you sorry! (MPC hangs up phone)

Mordecai: Whoa, this guy's good. I don't know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

Rigby: What, you givin' up? Dude, we can prank this guy. Do you want to be this guy's son, or do you want to be number one?

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm, let's do it. (Mordecai dials the phone) Hello, Master Prank Caller, this is...

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] Did it. (MPC hangs up)

Rigby: Hmm.

(Rigby dials the phone)

Rigby: Yeah, buddy, it's Joe Ma...!

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] Heard it. (MPC hangs up)

(Mordecai dials the phone)

Mordecai: Yeah, hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] You got anything original? (MPC hangs up)

Rigby: "Yeah, hello?" Dude, that was the worst try yet.

(Rigby dials the phone)

Rigby: Time to put an end to this junk fest. Hmm.

(MPC hangs up right away)

Mordecai: Looks like the junk fest just got a new member.

Rigby: Yeah, right, like your "50 pizzas" thing was way better.

Mordecai: Whatever Stan Manastan, man. (Laughs)

(Phone suddenly rings)

Mordecai: Pff, nice try, dude. I know it's you.

Rigby: Uh... not me, dude.

(Mordecai picks up and both listen)

Mordecai: Hello?

(The Master Prank Caller's feet are seen. He is in the bathtub)

Master Prank Caller: Is this the pizza guy or Stan Stanminson?

Mordecai: Uh... both?

Master Prank Caller: [on-screen] I warned you to leave me alone. Now I'm gonna prank you so hard, you're both gonna poop a duke. [off-screen] The 1980's called: they want their cell phones back!

(Mordecai and Rigby are sucked into the phone and are sent tumbling through cables in space, with year numbers floating around them)

Mordecai and Rigby: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(The two are sent to another spot in the Park after they get spit out of a portal)

Rigby: Where are we?

Mordecai: Dude, I think we're back at the park.

Rigby: Are we?

Mordecai: What do you mean?

Rigby: (eyeing the spots) Dude, all the trees are small, and look at that park bench, it's so new looking. I'm telling you, something weird's going on.

Mordecai: Look, there's Pops. Let's go ask him. (Pops is facing away from the duo, working on planting a tree) Pops! Hey, Pops, can you tell Rigby here that everything is fine?

(Pops turns around, looking and sounding much younger than normal, as well as lacking a mustache)

Pops: What now?

(Mordecai and Rigby both gasp)

Mordecai: Why does Pops look so young?

Pops: Now then, who are you two gentlemen? How do you know my name?

Mordecai: Pops, It's us, Mordecai and Rigby.

Pops: But I've never met either of you gentlemen in my entire life.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: I'm telling you, dude, something weird's going on.

(M&R see a few B-Boys dancing)

Rigby: Hey, guys!

B-Boy 1: What?

Rigby: You notice anything strange going on around here?

B-Boy 1: Is he getting fresh with us?

B-Boy 2: Yo, I think he's up in our threads, homefry.

B-Boy 1: That dillweed just barfed me out.

(B-Boys walks away)

Rigby: Fresh? Barf me out? Homefries? We're in the '80s, dude! Pops, what year is this?

Pops: Well, it's 1982, of course.

Rigby: See?

Mordecai: Dude, this is bad.

Rigby: I know, I don't even like the '80s that much!

Mordecai: The only way we're gonna get back is that we prank him harder than he pranked us.

Rigby: Let's do it.

(Mordecai dials the phone)

Master Prank Caller: Hello?

Mordecai: The '60s called, they want...

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] What did I tell you about calling me?! (A yellow, sparkling cloud begins to shoot out of the top of the phone, shocking Mordecai and Rigby)

Rigby: Hang up! Hang up!

Mordecai: I can't! (Mordecai drops the phone)

(A giant '80s cell phone morphs out of the cloud. It's the Master Prank Caller)

Master Prank Caller: You couldn't leave me alone. Now you're gonna pay! (MPC dials on himself)

Mordecai: We should get out of here.

Rigby: The cart!

(Mordecai and Rigby drive away in the golf cart. The Master Prank Caller follows them, dialling again. In the cart, the phone rings and Rigby picks up)

Rigby: Hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] The '80s called. They still want ya!

(80s clothes appear on Mordecai and Rigby. They gasp, the Master Prank Caller laughs, and Rigby hangs up)

Mordecai: Aw, man, these aren't even the cool clothes from the '80s!

(Phone rings again and Rigby picks up)

Rigby: Listen, just leave us alone, will you?!

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] Don't you ever hang up on me!

(More clothes from the '80s appear on Mordecai and Rigby. Mordecai waves his arm and screams at a golden bracelet on his arm that reads 'Dawn')

Mordecai: Dude, you have to call somebody to help us prank this guy!

Rigby: Who?!

Mordecai: Just call somebody!

(The scene cuts back to the present time at the park. The other 80s cell phone rings. Pops picks it up)

Pops: Ooh, telephone. Hello?

Rigby: Pops, you gotta help us; we're stuck in the '80s!

Benson: Who are you talking to?

Pops: Why it's Mordecai and Rigby. They're stuck in the 1980's.

Benson: Oh, really?

(Benson takes the phone away from Pops and begins talking, sarcastically)

Benson: Hello?

Mordecai: Benson, you have got to help us! We're stuck in 1982!

Benson: Oh, wow. That's really something, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Crap! He thinks we're pranking him!

Rigby: What? Give me that!

(Rigby shouts down the phone)

Rigby: The '80s [off-screen] called, they want their cell phones back!

(Pops, Benson and also Skips are sucked into the phone and are sent to 1982 through phone space, landing on the back of the golf cart)

Benson: What happened?

Mordecai: We need your help to prank the Master Prank Caller.

Benson: Who?

Skips: Why did you prank him?

(Phone rings and Benson picks up this time)

Benson: I'll take care of this. Hello?

Master Prank Caller: Nice ride, but I like mine better.

(MPC summons a limo, which he is driving beside the golf cart)

Master Prank Caller: Blargh!

(The park workers scream and the Master Prank Caller tries to ram them off the road)

Skips: Forget the phone, hold the wheel steady.

(Skips jumps onto the Master Prank Caller's limo. He tears the hood ornament from the back, jumps to the front of the limo and smashes it onto the engine. Skips jumps back to the golf cart as the Master Prank Caller's limo flips several times. The Master Prank Caller escapes from his crashed car and begins to dial himself, causing the phone in the cart to ring again)

Mordecai: Don't answer it, don't answer!

Skips: Mordecai, look out!

(Mordecai runs over younger Pops, who is crossing the street with one of the phones)

Rigby: Dude, we just hit past Pops!

(Pops rises, moans briefly, and lets out a manic laugh, much like his present self)

(Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops, and Skips crash into the '80s Electronic Store, where they come to rest next to a counter full of answering machines)

Clerk: Uh, can I help you with anything?

Mordecai: Dude, I got an idea.

(The scene cuts back to the park where the characters a running to the field getting ready to hide)

Mordecai: Quick, get to the field! Everybody hide! (The answering machine trap is deployed) Over there!

(Mordecai and Rigby put down the phone attached to a tape recorder and then hide in the bushes)

Mordecai: Man, I hope this works.

Rigby: It will, Mordecai. It has to.

(The phone rings. The tape recorder turns on with a recording of Mordecai's voice)

Voice of Mordecai: Hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] This is The Master Prank Caller telling you--

Voice of Mordecai: Hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] I said this is The Master Prank--

Voice of Mordecai: Hello? uh.. I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] I said this is The Master Prank Caller!

Voice of Mordecai: Hello, hello, are you there?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] RRRRGH! (The Master Prank Caller appears next to the phone and tape recorder) I SAID-- (Realizes that the voice is coming from a recorder - he's been psyched)

Voice of Mordecai: Ha ha! Just kidding. You just got pranked, loser! (Recording stops)

Master Prank Caller: NOOOOOOOOO!!!

Mordecai: Now! (Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Pops and Benson jump out of the bushes and make a dog pile on the Master Prank Caller, holding him down)

Mordecai: Now, Rigby, hit the power button!

Rigby: Who's the best prank caller now, jerk-dish?! (Rigby climbs up the phone and hits the power button)

Master Prank Caller: No! No! NOOOOOOO- (Shut down, the MPC falls to the ground and makes no movement Mordecai and Rigby laugh)

Mordecai and Rigby: In your face! Who's the master prank caller now, you loser?

(They they laugh again, a light shines out from the MPC's speaker. Mordecai and Rigby look in)

Mordecai: Guys, this is it; it's the way back! Come on!

(The park workers appear in a hallway with doors that each have a different year on them)

Mordecai: One of these doors leads us back to the present.

(Benson then spots the present door)

Benson: There it is.

(Benson, Skips, and Pops walk through the door, but as Mordecai and Rigby are about to go through, they see the Master Prank Caller)

Master Prank Caller: Wait. (MPC's speaker breaks, revealing his true identity - a thin, undead-looking man) You guys were better than me today, but you can't leave me here. All I ever wanted to do was make prank calls like you. Was that so wrong? (The Master Prank Caller splutters and moans. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

(Cuts to Benson's apartment where he receives a call)

Benson: Hello?

Mordecai, Rigby and the Master Prank Caller: (To each other off-screen) 1, 2, 3. (Into the phone off-screen) The '70s called: they want their chair back!

(Benson's chair disappear. Cuts to Mordecai, Rigby and the Master Prank Caller laughing at their prank)


(Episode starts at the Park)

Benson: You guys have all your assignments for today. Oh, and don't forget that tonight is Game Night.

Mordecai: Aw, yeah! Game Night!

Rigby: What are we playing?

Benson: Yeah, Skips, what are we playing?

Skips: Tonight, we will be playing Drawsome.

(All the park workers cheer)

Muscle Man: Alright. I love me some Drawsome. Who else is showing up to this Drawsome event?

Skips: I got a giant baby, Gary, and my cousin, Quips.

 (All the park workers groan in disappointment after mentioning Quips) 

Skips: What?

Mordecai: (annoyed) Your cousin Quips is really annoying.

Rigby: (also annoyed) Yeah, man, he's always telling lame jokes.

Skips: (confused) What are you guys talking about?

Mordecai: Come on, every other word out of that guy's mouth is some annoying joke.

Rigby: Yeah, some joke that isn't funny.

Skips: Come on, guys! His jokes aren't that bad.

(A taxi pulls up)

Quips: And then he said, "Yes, I do!" (Laughs) Alright, seriously, last one, cause I got to go. Why did- (The taxi driver is so annoyed by his jokes that he locks his door, and drives away fast as he can to avoid the jokes) Hey wait, I didn't get to finish my punchline! Aw well, he's probably already heard my routine. (He turns around and sees all of the others) Heeey, who's ready for some funny?

Everyone except Skips: Ugh!

Skips: You guys all remember my cousin, Quips.

Everyone except Skips: (displeased) Hey, Quips.

Quips: Hey, Benson. Nice to see ya. Speaking of "see ya," what did one ocean say to the other ocean? "'Sea ya later!" (Laughs)

Benson: I don't get it.

Quips: Oh, well, an ocean is a body of water, and the sea is also

Benson: I don't care.

Quips: A little more care will give you a little more hair. Zingo!

Benson: Ugh!

Pops: Hello, Quips.

Quips: Pops, looking good. In fact, you look amazing. Just a compliment, don't get a big head. (Everyone is shocked) Oops, too late! Zammo! (Pops is upset, while Mordecai, Rigby and HFG glare at Quips ragingly) And of course Muscle Man, you love the jokes, why do seagulls fly over the sea? Because if they flew over the bay, they'd be bay-gulls! (Laughs) I got a whole bit about bodies of water. What? You say you want another one?

Muscle Man: We didn't say anything.

Quips: What did the lake say to the puddle?

Skips: Come on, Quips. Let's get you unpacked. You probably want to lie down after your trip.

Quips: Guess it's time to take this comedy show on the road. And by comedy show, I mean me! Zingo! (Leaves)

Mordecai: (to Skips; aggravated) Dude, he's even worse than last time.

Rigby: Yeah, Skips. Tell your cousin that if he can't stop telling jokes, then he's gotta get outta here.

Skips: I can't just do that! I invited him here. No one told you to get rid of your brother Don when he visited.

Rigby: (furiously) That's because everyone loved him! I tried to get rid of him!

Skips: Ugh! Alright fine, I'll tell him soon.

(While Skips leaves, everyone coughs)

Quips: Wow guys, those coughs sound pretty serious. You guys should see a doctor. Oh, that reminds me, why did the clown go to the doctor? He was feeling a little funny!

(Scene cuts to Skips's garage)

Skips: I set up the extra cot for ya. Make yourself at home

Quips: Could I also make myself six feet tall and handsome? Zingo!

Skips: Look Quips, I gotta tell you something.

Quips: (serious) Wait, I need to tell you something. I just really appreciate you letting me hang out tonight, Skips.

Skips: Uh-huh.

Quips: I actually got fired from the comedy club, and I needed to hang out with family and friends. This weekend is really gonna help me get my confidence back. (Sniffles) Sorry. Didn't mean to get so serious. Don't worry! I'm gonna take a walk and come back funnier than ever. Zingo! (Leaves)

(Scene cuts to nighttime and everyone is at Skips's door. Skips comes out.)

Benson: Who's ready for some Drawsome?

Muscle Man: Drawsome! Whoo! (Waves his shirt around in the air)

Pops: I brought my pencil. Gimme somethin' to write on, man!

(Everyone laughs)

Benson: Wait, did you talk to your cousin?

Skips: I, uhh....

Quips: Knock, knock!

Mordecai: (In an annoyed tone of voice) Who's there?

Quips: Radio. (Long silence) You're supposed to go "Radio, who?"

Mordecai: (Sounding just as annoyed) Radio, who?

Quips: Radio not, here I come! Zingo! It's funny cuz' I said "Zingo!" at the end. And I see you brought a #2 Pencil. Do pencils even go Number #2? Maybe after too many beans. (Pops puts away his pencil and glares furiously at Quips) Do pencils even eat beans? I mean, am I right, guys? What's that all about? (Chuckles) So, who's ready to get started? You guys all in?

(Everyone begins to disagree angrily and walk away, because they refuse to play with Quips, because of his lame and bad jokes)

Skips: (Not wanting them to leave) Wait here, just a second. (Skips over to the guys) Wait! You guys can't leave!

Benson: Yes, we can.

Muscle Man: There's no way I'm playing Drawsome with that flop factory!

HFG: Yeah! He's not funny.

(Everyone agrees while continuing to walk away, but Skips stops Mordecai and Rigby)

Skips: Wait, Mordecai and Rigby! You guys have to stay! You know you owe me.

(Mordecai and Rigby remember flashbacks of things Skips has done to save them such, as defending them from a pack of blue red-eyed wolves, rescuing them from a sinkhole, and helping them escape a horde of what looks like Pops in form of a Man-Bat. Back in the present, Mordecai and Rigby change their minds)

Rigby: Alright, I guess we'll stay.

(scene cuts to Skips, Mordecai, Rigby, and Quips getting ready for "Drawsome")

Quips: Hey, you guys puttin' up paper?

Mordecai: (flatty) Yeah.

Quips: What did the guy paper, say to the girl paper, when he picked her up for a date? (long silence) I like your pad. (chuckles) Get it? Like a pad of paper! (Rigby groans as Gary and Reginald arrive with a bowl of dip)

Reginald: Hello.

Mordecai: Aw, dip!

Rigby: Whoo! Yeah! (everyone goes to try the dip.) This dip is great!

Mordecai: What's your secret?

Gary: A cosmic chef never reveals his methods.

Quips: Hey, have you heard the one about the chef in space? He was famous for his spaghetti and "meteorballs".Meteorballs? Yeah, I'm still working on it. (tries the dip as the guys glare at him in confusion)

Skips: Uh, okay everyone. Let's get this game night rolling.

(Scene cuts to the game starting, Mordecai draws a shrimp.)

Skips: Uh, lobster!

Rigby: Crustacean!

Skips: Shrimp! (Mordecai grunts and circles his picture) Jumbo Shrimp!

Mordecai: Yes! (laughs)

(scene cuts to Gary drawing an abnormal looking circle)

Quips: Go, Gary, Go!

Reginald: Is that Pops? Oh, villain! (Gary draws more of his picture)

Quips: Your mom? Your mom's boyfriend?

Skips: Time's up!

(Reginald, Quips and Gary groan in disappointment and defeat)

Gary: (drops the crayon in anger) Man in the moon! It was "Man in the moon"!

Quips: Wow! For real? I really thought that was your mom's boyfriend. Zingo! (Gary looks dumfounded. Montage of the game progress)  How you catch a unique lion? "Unique" up on him. Zingo! How do you catch a tame lion? "Tame" way! Zingo!

Mordecai: (agitated) Dude, is this Game Night or Lame Night?

Rigby: (annoyed) Yeah, we came here to play Drawsome, not listen to jokes.

Quips: Guys, guys. Call me crazy, but maybe if you laughed more, you'd have a better time. And maybe, you'll even draw better.

Gary: Hey, what do you think you're doing? You're on our team, remember?

Reginald: Yeah. Are you trying to make us lose?

Quips: It's just a game, Reggie. Hey, that reminds me! Why can't you play games in the jungle? Because there's always gonna be a "cheetah"!

Reginald: Just take the game seriously!

Skips: (takes Quips aside) Hey, Quips. Try not to upset Reginald.

Quips: Aw, why would I want to upset the little guy?

Skips: He gets upset if people don't take the game seriously.

Quips: I hear you, loud and clear, Skips.

Skips: Good. Okay, Reginald. You're up.

Quips: Good luck, Reggie!

Reginald: (groans) I don't need luck. I was a communications major. (draws picture)

Gary: Bacon?

Quips: Bacon.

Reginald: (annoyed) He just said that!

Quips: Uh, bacon!

Reginald: It isn't bacon!

Quips: C'mon! Are you sure its not bacon? Zingo!

Skips: Time!

Reginald: Fire engine! It is a fire engine! You would have got it if you didn't keep guessing "bacon"!

Quips: But guessing "Bacon" is way funnier than guessing "Fire Engine." (points) Look, it's got a side of eggs.

Reginald: That is a dalmatian!

Quips: (laughs) Dalmatian?

Reginald: I majored in communications!

Quips: Maybe it's time for a refresher course, cuz' all you're communicating here is that you don't know how to draw a Dalmatian. Zingo!

Reginald: What?! No one tells me that I need a refresher course!

Gary: That was a bit harsh, Quips."Drawsome" is supposed to be a safe space, free of judgement.

Quips: Aw. Is Baby upset? Is he gonna call the "Waahmbulance"?

Reginald: (enraged) How dare you!!

Quips: Whoa, whoa! Okay buddy. You were right, Skips, he does get upset when people don't take the game seriously. (Skips make a hand motion) Maybe somebody should tell him it's just a game. Zingo!

Reginald: SILENCE!!! 

(Finally furious with Quips' jokes, he zaps both Skips and Quips into a cube with his rattle)

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!!

Skips: Smooth move, Quips.

Quips: He missed out on a great punch line. (Skips punches a wall several times) Hey Reginald, you might wanna get some help for your anger issues. It could lead to high blood pressure. That's a dangerous health risk for a baby.

Reginald: I DO NOT HAVE ANGER ISSUES!!! (zaps the cube, sending it into a wall.)

Gary: Just take a deep breath, man. We're all just here to draw some pictures.

Skips: Quips, you gotta stop!

Quips: I haven't been this claustrophobic since before I was born. Talk about a "womb with a view." At least he's not closin' the walls in on us.

Reginald: Great idea! (shrinks the cube)

Skips: Aw, why did you say that? We're gonna get crushed!

Quips: It was a joke!

(Skips tries to stop the cube from shrinking)

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips, Skips! (both toss a dumbbell at the cube but get zapped)

Quips: Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the crib. Zingo!

(Reginald growls in anger)

Gary: Calm down, man. Have some 7-layer dip.

Quips: Jeez. I didn't mean to get you all "rattled"! (laughs) Skips! Did you see what I did there? I used "rattle"! Can't this guy take a joke?

Reginald: Okay, funny man! If you're so fond of your jokes, why don't you listen to some of your own? (zaps the cube, bringing goofy looking pictures of Quips onto the walls)

Quips Photo #1: Where do sheep go to get their haircuts?

Quips Photo #2: To the "baa-baa" shop.

Quips Photo #3: Why was the broom late for school? It "over-swept".

Quips Photo #4: How do you catch a fish on your computer? With the "Inter-Net".

Quips: (laughs) This guy is pure gold! Don't worry, Skips. I'll just tell Reggie some more jokes.

Skips: What? What are you talking about?

Quips: Seriously. As soon as I get him laughing, he'll let us out for an encore.

Skips: He's not gonna laugh at your jokes! (pushes against the walls, making them crack)

Quips: Sure he will! Maybe he just has a problem with understanding them.

Skips: THE BABY IS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE! YOU ARE!

Quips: What do you mean?

Skips: All you do is tell bad jokes!

Quips: What?! People love those jokes.

Skips: No, they don't! (punches a wall) Quips, you're not funny! (continues punching walls until the cube is entirely destroyed.)

Mordecai: Skips, are you alright?

Skips: Yeah, I've been worse.

Quips: (groans) I had no idea that you guys didn't think I was funny. I thought you all called me "Quips" because my last name is "Quippenger".

Skips: No, it's because you're always telling jokes.

Rigby: Yeah, really bad jokes.

Skips: Rigby! Look, Quips, I know you really wanna be a comedian, but it's just really annoying when you're always trying out your material on us.

Quips: I'm sorry, everybody. I had no idea. I just really thought you guys all thought I was hilarious. I wish you had told me this sooner.

Skips: That's okay.

Quips: This must be why I got fired from the comedy club. Zingo! (Gary and Reginald blush a little) Sorry, sorry! Just kidding. I promise I'll stop now.

Skips: Actually, I think I know a place that your jokes just might work.

(scene cuts to Quips dressed like a clown)

Quips: Why do clowns love telling jokes? Because they "nose" what's funny! (honks nose) Zingo! (children laugh)

Skips: That's a better audience for him.

Mordecai: Um, yeah.

(End of Quips)

(Episode starts with Mordecai and Rigby playing a video game.)

Rigby: Alright, Level 10! We better not lose this time.

Mordecai: Dude, quit messing around and we'll beat it.

Rigby: Last time wasn't my fault.

Mordecai: Whatever, just take it seriously.

Both: Triple thugs! Triple thugs! Beat them up! (Does so while saying "triple thugs")

(POW! POW! (500) POW! After defeating the Triple Thugs, a burly pink monster-like man comes across the characters in the game and roars)

Rigby: Oh no, not this guy! We never beat this guy!

Mordecai: Dude, we're gonna do it this time. Come on, hit him! Hit him!

Rigby: I am hitting him, nothing's happening!

Mordecai: Aw, dude! Try kicking him in the junk! Kick him in the junk! Kick him in the junk!

Rigby: I'm kicking him in the junk!

Mordecai: Well, keep doing it!

(KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK! BEEP! (1200) The monster is defeated)

Mordecai and Rigby: Oooooooohhhh!

Mordecai: I told you we were gonna do it. I told you!

Rigby: I knew we were gonna make it.

Mordecai: Yeah, right. That's not what you said 20 hours ago when you were whining about how hard the game was.

Rigby: *Gasps* Look! We made it to the final level!

Mordecai: Dude, do you know what this means?

Rigby: We're dead?

Mordecai: No, we have to beat The Hammer.

Rigby: What was the slogan of this game again, "Nobody Beats The Hammer"?

Mordecai: Yeah, right. More like nobody has even seen The Hammer.

Rigby: Well, get ready to live. He's probably gonna come out of those doors.

[(BUST!...) Goes the brick wall. Out comes The Hammer.]

The Hammer: Nobody beats The Hammer.

Rigby: It's The Hammer! (Mordecai and Rigby jump off he couch) Hit 'im! Hit 'im!

(KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK! Nothing happens)

Mordecai: Man, our hits aren't doing anything!

Rigby: I know, my thumbs are killing me!

(KICK! KICK! Nothing still happens) 

(BAM! BEEP! BAM! BEEP! The Hammer punches both characters. It take both of their lives with ease.)

Mordecai: Just one of his hits takes a whole life! 

(BAM! BAM! BEEP! The Hammer flings Mordecai's character onto Rigby's and and then lands on them. Both characters' second life is taken away at the same time. One more life gone, then game over for them.)

Mordecai: *Gasps* Run away, dude, run away!

(Their characters run away from The Hammer while he chases them in circles.)

Rigby: Don't let him touch you, man!

Mordecai: I'm not, I'm not! (his character is cornered by The Hammer) AHH! RIGBY, HELP ME!

(Rigby's character grabs a chair and slams it against the back of The Hammer)

Rigby: YEAHHH!

The Hammer: Arrrrgh!

Mordecai: Dude, his weakness is furniture! Furni-

Mordecai: What just happened? (runs to the TV to quickly turn it back on)

Rigby: I don't know! (picks up the remote while panicking)

Mordecai: (moves the TV onto the side, and then slams the top of it to make the picture appear for about a second, and then it flicks off again.) Oh! Dude, the game's still on! Pause it, dude, pause it!

Rigby: ( presses a button) It's paused!

Mordecai:  Aww, Man! (While slamming the TV) Come on! Come on! (stops slamming) Rigby, you finish him off.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Dude, we figured out his weakness, I'll keep the TV on while you beat The Hammer.

Rigby: Alright, let's do it!

Mordecai: Ready....Go! (starts drumming onto TV to keep the picture on)

(Rigby's character attempts to fight off the Hammer, but it proves too much for him to beat all by himself.)

Rigby: (grunting and freaking out) EEEAAAARRRGH!... I can't do it!... (pauses the game again as his character's life has decreased heavily from he hammer's single punch.)

Mordecai: Awww, man! We were totally gonna beat it.

Rigby: (sighs) I know. He's just too hard to beat alone.

Mordecai: Argh....dude, we gotta find another TV...

(Mordecai and Rigby go off to see Skips)

Skips: The Hammer? Nobody gets to The Hammer. But even if you did, I don't have a TV.

Mordecai and Rigby: Argh!

Skips: What's wrong with the TV in the house?

Mordecai: I don't know, it's broken.

Rigby: Yeah, the screen doesn't work.

Mordecai: Yeah. Come on, Skips, you gotta have some mystical solution or some weird thing we could use for how we could get another TV.

Skips: Hmm... Did you ask Pops?

(Mordecai and Rigby go back into the house to see Pops)

Pops: Ooooooh! The Hammer, how exciting, is he a mallet or a gavel? (laughs)

Mordecai: Pops seriously, can we borrow your TV?

Pops: Of course.

Mordecai and Rigby: Yes!

Pops: Here she is. (Pops brings them his radio instead and places it on the floor)

Mordecai: Pops, that's a radio.

Pops: It's a TV if you close your eyes. (He then switches on his radio and closes his eyes) Now hook up your game so you can defeat The Hammer. (laugh)

Rigby: We don't have time for this...

Mordecai: Rock, Paper, Scissors for who has to ask Muscle Man for his TV?

Mordecai: (knowing that's he has to do it) Argh...

Rigby: Hmm, Hmm!

Mordecai: Come on, Rigby, let's go get a real TV.

Pops: Wait! I want to see The Hammer too! (follows Mordecai and Rigby out the room)

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops make their way to Muscle Man's trailer. Mordecai knocks on his door.)

Muscle Man: (From behind the door) Who is it?

Mordecai: It's us.

Muscle Man: What do you want?

Mordecai: We wanna borrow your TV.

Muscle Man: Why?

Mordecai: Because... we're about to beat The Hammer.

Muscle Man: WHAT? (he opens the door) NOBODY can't beat The Hammer, It's impossible.

Mordecai: Pft. Not for us. Are you gonna let us borrow your TV or not?

Muscle Man: Yeah, you can borrow it, if you can tell me what The Hammer looks like.

Mordecai: He's blue. With a black mullet.

Muscle Man: Fives.

(Hi Five Ghost looks in the video game manual and sees that the character matches the description.)

Hi Five Ghost: Uh, huh.

Muscle Man: Oh, man!

Rigby: So can we borrow it?

Muscle Man: Yeah, you can borrow it, so we can watch you lose. Hahaha! Whoo, whoo! (runs back in to pick his TV up from the floor but without knowing that it is still plugged in) This is gonna be hilari- oh!

(The TV then smashes onto the ground.)

Rigby: (after a moment of silence) Does Benson have a TV?

(The group then travel to Benson's apartment. Mordecai knocks on his door.)

Rigby: Tell him we need it.

Mordecai: Shh!

Muscle Man: Yeah, tell him we need it to see you lose.

Mordecai: SHUT UP! (he and Muscle Man wrestle a bit until Benson comes out) 

Mordecai: Oh, hey, Benson.

Rigby: Tell him we need it. (he then gets slapped by Mordecai)

Benson: What is it?

Mordecai: Oh, uh, we were just in the neighborhood-

Benson: Cut to the chase, I am busy.

Mordecai: Can we borrow your TV?

Benson: Hehe... No. (proceeds to close the door on them but is then blocked by Muscle Man and Rigby)

Muscle Man: No, wait!

Rigby: Benson, please! We're about to beat The Hammer! We neeeed it!

Benson: Yeah, The Hammer. When you say that, I think hammer and nails, but you couldn't possibly be talking about work.

Mordecai: It's a video game.

Benson: Oh. right, right, it's a video game.

Mordecai: Yeah, it's a video game.

Rigby: Yeah, so can we borrow your TV?

Benson: No.

Everyone: Awww, come on, please... (but Benson closes the door on them)

Mordecai: Argh... (Rigby kicks Benson's door and the light switches off above them)

Pops: Look! There's TVs on Benson's TV!

Man 1: (On TV): TV Store Warehouse! We've got TVs!

Man 2: Too many TVs! Take your pick! We're practically giving them away! No, wait! We're literally giving them away!

Man 1: We're literally giving TVs away!

Both: LITERALLY!

Man 1: And the other TVs are really cheap!

Man 2: Yeah, so those ones were practically literally giving away for free too!

Both: LITERALLY!

Man 1: You better be a truck with a big box in it, 'cause we're just throwing 'em away!

Man 2::Yeah, TVs are trash to us, and so are you...

Both: ...AT THE TV STORE WAREHOUSE!

Mordecai: Does anybody know how far that place is from here?

Muscle Man: Not far. I got a buddy who works there.

Mordecai: Let's do it.

(The group then drives on to the TV Store Warehouse)

Mordecai: (Inside the warehouse) We want one of those flat screens from the commercial.

Jimmy: The flat screens are full-price.

(The guys are shocked.)

Rigby: What? But your commercial said you were giving away free TVs.

Muscle Man: Come on, Jimmy, you gotta have something.

Jimmy: Sorry, dude, there's nothing I can do, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: Jimmy.....come on, Jimmy......you know you owe me and besides, this is worth it. These guys made it all the way to The Hammer, AND I WANNA SEE 'EM LOSE!

Jimmy: Whoa, are you serious? (Looks around) Okay, look, I might have something, but don't tell anyone...

Muscle Man: What is that?

Jimmy: It's a TV.

Mordecai: Does it even turn on?

Jimmy: Yeah.....(switches the TV on, but the screen is in grayscale)

Rigby: What? It's not even in color! Lame.

(The group is not satisfied with the model and they loudly complain.)

Jimmy: Look, you guys wanted a TV for free, This is your free TV.

Mordecai: How much for your cheapest flat screen?

Jimmy: $1,200.

(Knowing that they can't afford it, the group take the free TV with them back home. Mordecai places it near the TV they usually use.)

Rigby: Make sure the game's still paused.

(Mordecai slams onto their TV, revealing The Hammer)

Muscle Man: Whoa! You really did get to The Hammer!

Rigby: Yeah. That's what we've been saying the whole time.

Muscle Man: I thought you were lying.

Rigby: Why would we do that?

Muscle Man: Cause you're not good enough at anything to get to The Hammer, This is just a fluke! (he shoves Rigby) 

Rigby: (shoves Muscle Man back) You're the fluke!

Mordecai: Guys, stop! stop!! We've got a problem. This thing doesn't have the right hook-ups.

Rigby: What? Well, what does it have?

Mordecai: I don't know! It's like a weird...thing, but it doesn't match this other thing, plus, it doesn't even plug in. I mean, look at this!

Rigby: What kind of plug is that?

Muscle Man: Forget this, man. You guys aren't even gonna beat The Hammer anyway. Just turn it off. (he proceeds to turn the video game console off but Mordecai stops him)

Mordecai: No! We can't just give up. I wanna beat this thing. We may never get this far in the game again. Now, come on, will you please just help us? Please help us? (his attention is actually on the TV instead of the others, Muscle Man puts his hand on his shoulder to assure him that they will help out)

Muscle Man: Let us try...bro.

(Muscle Man rips the cord from his smashed TV back at his caravan home and returns with it while Rigby and Pops visit Skips asking for his aid, he's reluctant but is willing to help them out. Muscle Man connects his TV cord while Skips breaks Pops' radio to bring out the speakers and places both on either side of the TV. He even plugs in the small hook-up.)

Mordecai: Keep your fingers crossed. (he looks around Rigby and switches on the TV, which then works, despite being grayscale, The others are happy about it. They cheer.).

Mordecai: (Looks at Rigby, they both have the controllers in their hands) Ready?

Rigby: Ready.

Everyone: Whoa....

Muscle Man: It's The Hammer! (He runs to go near him) He's real!

(The Hammer looks questionably at him)

Muscle Man: Dudes, take my picture with- (He gets knocked out by The Hammer) Oh no, br-- (The Hammer squashes him with his leg)

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!!

Rigby: That doesn't look good...

Mordecai: What's he doing...?

Skips: Everybody get down!

Jimmy: Yo, Muscle Man, my boss found out that I gave you guys that TV and he fired me. Is it cool if I crash here for a couple dawhat the--? (he's stunned to see The Hammer in view and then he is blasted away by the energy ball while screaming, and which kills him instantly by explosive)

Skips: How are we supposed to hurt him?

Mordecai: I don't know. He was invincible in the game too until we hit him with...*gasps* furniture! Everybody quick! Grab whatever you can and smash it on him!

(So they all grab as many furniture items around the room and one by one, they proceed to hit The Hammer. Soon, The Hammer starts to weaken after taking in so many hits.)

Mordecai: Dude, he's almost dead!

Skips: Quick! Find something else!

Rigby: There's no more furniture!

Rigby: Skips, his legs! Watch out for his legs!

Mordecai: Skips, catch! (he throws the chair in his direction and Skips guards himself with it. The Hammer gets hit in the groin area and falls to the floor)

Skips: The control pads! Grab the control pads!

(Mordecai and Rigby run towards The Hammer to take hold of his hands which are the control pads while the others hold onto both of his legs. The Hammer tries to break free, but he remains restrained and his face transits to the video game in color.)

Mordecai and Rigby: *gasp* The game!

Skips: Play it!!!

(Mordecai and Rigby finish off the game, hitting The Hammer with chairs and gain an easy win with the words "YOU WIN" in the screen. Then, The TV falls then breaks and the power comes back on. Everyone gathers together, to celebrate their victory on defeating The Hammer)

Mordecai: Yeah! we did it!

Benson: Hey, guys. There was a blackout at my place, so I figured tha- (he is shocked to find the house in a mess and without saying another word, he leaves)

(The episode starts with Mordecai and Rigby watching CrewCrew.)

Alpha-Dog: Alright, so who's next? Who thinks they can take on the legendary CrewCrew?

CrewCrew: CrewCrew! (Big Trouble walks up.)

Alpha Dog: Looks like Big Trouble's back for more.

Rigby: Dude, another battle's about to start!

Mordecai: Ahh, Yeauhhh!

Alpha Dog: Man, this dude is back every week.

Big Trouble: Nah, I got y'all fools this time, hit it! (V-Tron turns on the radio.) (Rapping) You all better watch out, cause Big Trouble's on the mic now, i'll knock all o' your lights out, with my verse, y'all be cursed, blowing up like fireworks. powwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

Alpha-Dog: That's it? Blitz Comet, show this fool how we do.

Blitz Comet: (Rapping) Blitz Comet on the scene. You step to me and you gonna get creamed-corn! All up in your teeth, you reek, you're the opposite of chic, ya freak! Your ryhmes are all antiques. Nobody wants em, they throw em all away. Right from the get go like your brain is on delay. Matter of fact yo, you better get a check up. Go ask your doctor, why you be so ugly from the neck UP?

(Crowd cheers and Big Trouble walks away.)

Mordecai and Rigby: OHHHHHHH!!!!

Pops: Excuse me.

Mordecai: What is Pops doing?

Pops: A hug can be a wonderful thing. Two arms wrapped around you like a mother's wing. But we're so selfish when we are blue. Doesn't a hug deserve a hug too? Thank you.

Alpha Dog: Yo, whatcha say? Nah, nah, nah, nah, hold on man.

Blitz Comet: You trying to step to us?

Pops: I'm just so excited to hear some fellow poets. I thought I come join you in the celebration of rhymes.

Alpha-Dog: Nah, nah, nah, nah, you're not celebrating nothin'! Yo V-Tron, turn it up. Yeah, CrewCrew's coming at you. Say it twice, don't forget it. Y'all better catch up to where we're at. You're behind the times. Can't compete with our dope rhymes. So you better say your goodbyes. We got Francois, Blitz Comet, V-Tron, the Jersey kid, on the beats. You know we rock. Then Demel-Ishun, the dopest girl on the mic. And Alpha-Dog, I bark the truth, my verses be all nice and tight. So now you know who were are. CrewCrew is the crew shining brighter than a quazar. But your bizarre. Yes, you sir, are a loser. So cover up that freakish dome and head back home and take your poems.OOOH, loser!

Everyone at the Snack Bar: Loser.

(Pops is about to cry)

Mordecai: Aw dude. Come on! Pops, are you ok?

Pops: While I appreciate their poetic skills, I am not a loser.

Alpha-Dog: (scoffs) You look like a loser to me.

Blitz Comet: Yeah, why don't you take gramps back home before he starts crying some more? [laughs] Loser.

Mordecai: C'mon, Pops, let's go.

Pops: [shoves Mordecai away] No! [walks up to Alpha Dog] I'll have you know my verses won many a competition!

Pops: You don't believe me? I challenge you to a competition tonight!

Alpha Dog: You mean a rap battle?

Pops: If that's what you're calling it, then yes.

Alpha Dog: Alright, grandpops. Crew-Crew never backs down! So it's on.

Francois: You're going down!

Demel-Ishun: You're gonna get yours, buddy!

Mordecai: Alright Pops, we can't let you do this by yourself.

Rigby: Yeah, those guys are gonna walk all over you!

Mordecai: Plus, we know way more stuff about this than you do. So Rigby and I will rap with you in the battle.

Pops: Really!? Our own crew, good show!

Mordecai: Alright Pops, here's how you battle. Rigby, show him. [makes a beat]

Rigby: Hey Mordecry, oh I mean Mordecai, didn't mean to diss you please don't run away and hide, saw you sobbing at that movie 'A Very Happy Bride', here I'll pass you a tissue, try to have some male pride!

Mordecai: [stops beat] See Pops, it's easy!

Rigby: 'coz the ladies don't like your sensitive side, like Margaret for example but I guess that's implied!

Mordecai: Okay, dude.

Rigby: She won't get with you, she just won't get with you, not gonna get with you, never gonna get with you-

Mordecai: Okay, we get it!

Rigby: I'm just keeping it real.

Mordecai: Now you try Pops.

Pops: But he's just making fun of you!

Mordecai: Exactly! That's what you gotta do! Now give it a shot.

Pops: [struggles] No, I won't do it!

Rigby: What!? C'mon, you said you wanted to win!

Pops: Being negative and hurting someone's feelings is no way to win a competition! The power of poetry lies in expressing the beauty of everything around you!

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: You're not making any sense.

Pops: Come, I'll show you!

Pops: [clears throat] What is this place, this magical field, it's wide and it's open, nothing's concealed. It's sceneic and peaceful for us to enjoy, why this is the park, good show old boy!

Mordecai: Hmhm, not bad!

Rigby: Yeah!

Pops: A place of great beauty for plenty to use, it inspires us all so go spread the news, to man woman and child or begging cowboy, this is the park, good show old boy!

Mordecai: Where's this stuff coming from?

Rigby: Man, he's getting into it! [laughs]

Pops: The key to this place puts a smile on your face, it is the people it does employ!

Pops, Mordecai and Rigby: Why this is the park, good show old boy! [laughs]

Blitz Comet: Yo, is he for real with that?

Demel-Ishun: (mockingly) Good show old boy?

Alpha Dog: You're gonna have to do better than that if you wanna beat us tonight. you big headed loser.

Pops: Hmph, go ahead and make snide remarks. Me and my crew are taping into the power of poetry, and the beauty of our verses will be sure to knock your socks off.

Alpha Dog: See you fools tonight, unless you too afraid to show up.

Pops: We'll be there.

Alpha Dog: Lo-ser.

Pops: Their rhymes are clever but they don't come from the heart. As long as we're true to ourselves we can't lose. Oh look, ice-cream truck! [runs away]

Mordecai: Ugh, dude, this is not good! We gotta find a way to back out of the battle.

Rigby: Yeah man, I'm totally with you, those guys are gonna destroy us!

Pops: Mordecai and Rigby, look! I have a surprise for you. [pulls out Elizabethan-style costumes] Tah-dah! I made matching uniforms for tonight!

Mordecai: Pops, we can't do this.

Pops: What do you mean?

Mordecai: Look, we're gonna lose!

Pops: No, the power of poetry will d-

Rigby: Pops, the power of poetry isn't even a thing!

Mordecai: C'mon, Pops, this is dumb. We should just back out.

Pops: Well I don't have that option. Those gentleman called me a loser and I must set them straight.

Mordecai: Yeah, but what if they're right? Uh, I mean-

Pops: (defeatedly) Fine, I'll do it your way. [drops costumes] I'll do it your way! [runs crying and screaming]

Mordecai: Wait, Pops, that's not what we meant!

Pops: [screaming] I'll do it your way!

Mordecai: Shoot.

Rigby: Man, I feel kinda bad.

Mordecai: I know, but Pops just doesn't get it! I mean Skips, you're not all into classical poetry, right?

Skips: [sips soup] Eh, haikus, mostly.

Rigby: Seriously?

Mordecai: Okay, but what're we supposed to do? If we dress up like idiots and go down to recite poetry against that crew, we'll be humiliated!

Rigby: Yeah, losers for life!

Skips: [pushes bowl away] I've lost my appetite. [skips away]

Mordecai and Rigby: (reading the alphabet soup) Mordecai, Rigby. Friends don't let down other friends. You guys are losers.

Mordecai: [sighs] He's right.

Rigby: Man, poetry's powerful stuff.

Pops: Your attitude is unappealing some would say quite rude. Your shoes are colorful - no! [groans in frustration]

Alpha Dog: C'mon tough guy, why are you tongue tied? Watch out everybody looks like grandpa's about to cry!

[Crew-Crew laughs]

Mordecai: Whether in righteous storms or the rainiest of days-

Pops: Poetry!?

Rigby: -friends stick with friends through thick and thin always.

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, you came!

Mordecai: We're sorry, Pops, we were acting like fools-

Rigby: -we hope you can forgive us for being complete tools-

Mordecai: -your poems aren't lame, they're really works of art-

Rigby: -if we gotta win this battle we gotta do it from the heart!

Pops: Oh, thank goodness! Your way wasn't working at all!

[Pops, Mordecai and Rigby hug]

Alpha Dog: So what up? Are will battlin' or have y'all smartened up?

Pops: Let's do this! [clicks fingers] '[Record starts playing, lights dim. Crowd murmurs in awe] Beauty's in the center of all that you see, simple yet complex and fully textured. And beauty be apart of all that you be, because you are the best rhymers that I've ever heard!

Mordecai: Aww yeah, they're into it!

Demel-Ishun: Aw what!? Uh uh, this is real now.

Demel-Ishun: Why you talking 'bout beauty, man, don't understand what's that got to do with you, you fool. You guys are like spoiled hams-

Demel-Ishun: -in a can- [Rigby turns into a can with a red glow] -super bland, expiration date's overdue!

Rigby: The canning of meat is quite a sweet treat, so thanks for comparing us so. Your words are inspiring, my dear so concrete, you really put on quite a show!

Blitz Comet: Okay, hold up, you wanna talk words and verse, but your face is distracting, so ugly it bugs me, take care of that mess and sweep it under the rug please, so trust me, you're only taking matters from bad to worse, so the only solution is to turn around in reverse.

Mordecai: A gift to us, a new perspective on things, life looking different from where you stand true? So much to discover so spread your wings and take flight for a birds eye view!

Alpha Dog: Okay, things be getting serious, you guys are delirious, are you hearing this? Talkin' 'bout positive things, but you ain't got no game, and it's plain to see, you're strange to me 'coz we be shining like diamonds, y'all be petty cash, nice mustache- [Conquistador appears glowing red and pulls at Pops' mustache]-conquistador's been wanting it back, in fact what are you, a rat- [Rigby turns into a rat] -a squirrel- [Rigby turns into a squirrel] -some kinda fat meerkat who thinks he's rad- [Rigby turns into a fat meerkat] -and look at that-[Mordecai begins spewing blue glowing words out of his mouth] -your bird friend's dropping words absurd again, you spit a rhyme that exposes the nerd in him, if you think Alpha Dog is gonna lie down and let you win, your head be all inflated I guess just like a giant blimp. [Pops' head turns into a blimp, crowd cheers wildly]

Mordecai: Okay Pops, you got this!

Rigby: Yeah, you can finish him off!

Pops: It's been some time since I've felt this way, challenged by such worthy opponents. Your rhyme scheme is good but you're missing a few components. You may say things that are hurt or some things that will sting, but for you it's all just posturing. Look inside and be true to some real feelings and the world will be yours I'm assuring you. So I thank you good sirs for this great contest- [Red beam comes out of Pops' chest] -it's certainly been lots of fun, but there's nothing you can say to put me to rest, so really, I've already won. [Beam explodes in Alpha Dog's face, crowd cheers] We did it, we won!

Rigby: We're not losers!

Pops: My, that was exhilarating! Thank you for standing by me, the power of poetry is nothing compared to the power of friendship!

Mordecai: No problem Pops.

Rigby: Yeah-yuh! I'm just glad no-one can call us losers now.

Muscle Man: Hey losers, where'd you get those outfits? My mom's closet? [laughs and high-fives Hi Five Ghost]

Mordecai: We should probably go change clothes.

(Episode begins with Pops' House. Mordecai, Rigby, CJ and Eileen are playing a game called Mineropoly. CJ rolls the dice.)

CJ: Six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Coyote Flats. I'd like to buy a mine.

(Eileen slowly picks up a card)

Eileen: In the mine, you find...gold!

CJ: Yes!

Mordecai: Aaaaawww...

Eileen: (Flips over the card) Foolsgold!

CJ: Aw, man.

Mordecai, Rigby, and Eileen: Ooooooohhhhh!

Eileen: The scientific name for foolsgold is pyrite.

Mordecai: My turn. (Rolls the dice) C'mon, Papa needs a brand new pickaxe!

(Benson appears in the doorway with a handful of mail)

Benson: Are you gonna take care of this mail? It's been stacked up by the door for weeks.

Rigby: We get mail? (Turns to Mordecai) Did you know this?

Benson: Get it outta there! (He drops the mail) Do it or you're fired! Eileen. Dodgeball girl. (He leaves)

(Rigby picks up a football trophy with a drawing of Rigby's head that says "World Rugby Association"; the "u" in "Rugby" is covered by an "I", spelling "Rigby")

Rigby: Aw, yeah! My order from Trophy Discounters!

Mordecai: (Looks at one of the letters) Couple Corral?

CJ: What?

Eileen: You're still subscribed to that dating site?

Rigby: Dude, you're not single.

CJ: Uh, yeah. (She elbows Mordecai playfully) I deleted my profile.

Mordecai: Hey, I forgot, alright? Okay, everybody watch.

(He takes out his phone)

Voice: Delete profile?

(Mordecai presses "Yes", then a wheel rolls as it's loading)

Mordecai: See, it's being deleted right...

(A gunshot sound is heard as an X appears, then Mordecai looks at his phone)

Voice: Are you sure, pardner?

Mordecai: (Annoyed) Yes!

(He presses "Yes")

Voice: Did you mean to press "No"?

Mordecai: Hold on.

Eileen: So how long have you two been together?

CJ: Hmm. We've been hanging out for a month now.

Rigby: "Hanging out"? "Hanging out"?!

Eileen: Sounds pretty casual, guys. I mean, have you ever been on a nice, romantic date?

Mordecai: This is a date.

Eileen: This is game night, Mordecai. I mean a real date.

Mordecai and CJ: A real date?

CJ: Does that time we had all-you-can-eat crab at Seafood Sal's count?

Rigby and Eileen: No.

CJ: Oh my gosh.

Mordecai: I'm gonna make reservations at a nice restaurant.

CJ: I'm gonna buy a new outfit.

Mordecai: Saturday at seven?

CJ: Saturday at seven.

(Mordecai and CJ run away to make plans to get ready)

Rigby: Hello? Game night?

(A clock transition to the next day. Rigby is playing a video game and Mordecai is holding up a small jewelry box.)

Mordecai: Dude, Rigby, you got a second? I want to show you what I bought for CJ.

Rigby: (He puts down the game controller) Okay, what do you got?

(Rigby opens the box to reveal a bracelet with charms shaped like a shopping cart, a laser gun, a cloud butt, a roller skate, a video game controller, a grilled cheese sandwich, a go-kart, an alligator, and an air hockey mallet.)

Rigby: What is this? What am I looking at?

Mordecai: It's a charm bracelet. There's a different charm for all the stuff CJ and I did the first time we met. (He points to each individual charm) There's a little roller skate and a grilled cheese and an air hockey mallet.

Rigby: Wow, Mordecai! This is the kind of thing that pros get their girlfriends.

Mordecai: Right? I'm just not sure how to give it to her, though.

Rigby: Here's an idea. How about if you say you have something for her, and then you give it to her! (He hands the box to Mordecai) Classic gift-giving technique, bro.

Mordecai: No, dude. I've gotta do it in some way that's really special.

(Benson appears with a handful of mail again)

Benson: What's this?

Mordecai: It looks like-

Benson: No, no, I'll tell you. It's the stack of junk mail I asked you to take care of yesterday!

(Benson tosses the junk mail in Mordecai and Rigby's laps)

Mordecai: But we threw that out!

Benson: Really? You threw this mail that I found not in the trash into the trash?

Mordecai: Wait. This is new junk mail. And it's all from Couple Corral. Man, what is it with these guys? Hey, Benson, do you have any ideas for a romantic way to give a gift to a girl?

Benson: Well... I've always thought it would be nice to have a waiter serve a gift box in place of dessert.

Rigby: Look at you, Benson! How are you still single?

Mordecai: Yeah; that idea's genius.

Benson: (Shrugs) I'm just spitballing here.

Mordecai: Well, thanks for the tip, Benson. I'm gonna go call the restaurant right now.

(As Mordecai dials the restaurant's number on his phone, the scene circle-wipes to the Coffee Shop. Eileen pours a cup of coffee for CJ.)

Eileen: So, big date's tonight, huh?

CJ: Yeah.

Eileen: What kind of place are we talking? Is this an oyster/crackers or a warm rolls establishment?

CJ: I think they might charge extra for bread.

Eileen: Ooh, romantic. (Puts the coffee pot down) So what's your "hes"?

CJ: I'm just not sure it's gonna be enough. This night has to be amazing, you know?

CJ and Eileen: Hmm...

CJ: Maybe I can get a special dessert for Mordecai.

Eileen: Yeah! What does he like?

CJ: Waffles, chocolate...

Eileen: There's a new pastry shop downtown that specializes in chocolate-covered waffle cakes.

CJ: That's perfect! I'll take him there for dessert to surprise him.

Eileen: You just gotta make sure not to fill up on bread at dinner.

(Circle-wipe scene transition to Bistro en le Parc. Mordecai and CJ are sitting at a table near a window.)

CJ: Could this get any more romantic?

Mordecai: Oh, well... maybe. (Sips water from a glass)

(The concierge approaches Mordecai from behind)

Concierge: You have a call at the front.

Mordecai: (He shrugs and rises out of his seat) To be continued.

(Mordecai walks up to the front desk, and the concierge hands him the phone)

Mordecai: Hello?

Matchmaker McIntyre: Matchmaker McIntyre here, CEO of Couple Corral. This is not a recording.

Mordecai: Uh, hi?

McIntyre: We noticed earlier you deleted your profile. So sad to see ya go. We really appreciate your business, so I'm beggin' ya to rejoin.

Mordecai: (Talking over McIntyre's voice) Hello? Hello?

McIntyre: If you come back to us today, you'll get free romantic coupons. To rejoin, say "yee-haw!" To cancel, say "adios".

Mordecai: Adios! Adios!

(Mordecai hangs up, and the screen pans over to show McIntyre standing behind him)

Mordecai: Aah!

McIntyre: Told ya I wasn't a recording! What do ya mean "adios", pardner?

Mordecai: Uh, I don't need Couple Corral anymore. I'm in a relationship now, so...

McIntyre: Here's what I'm thinkin'. Break up with CJ.

Mordecai: (Angrily) Excuse me?

McIntyre: Break up with her and rejoin my site! (Wraps an arm around Mordecai) Couple Corral could help you find somebody better.

Mordecai: Dude, I'm happy with CJ.

McIntyre: Will you be though after we dredge through her profile? (Takes out his phone) Okay, let's see what we dig up here.

(McIntyre shows Mordecai photos of CJ with different hairstyles.)

Mordecai: Isn't keeping her information, like, really illegal?

McIntyre: You'd think. (He stops on a photo of goth CJ) Whoa! How do you expect her to be committed to you when this girl can't even commit to a hairstyle?

Mordecai: (Shoves McIntyre away) So? I like CJ. Now leave me alone.

(Mordecai walks away, and McIntyre glares at him menacingly. Cut to Mordecai and CJ's table. CJ is on the phone.)

CJ: Hi, L'Wafflerie? I just wanted to check and see if the waffle cake I ordered is ready.

(CJ gasps and quickly puts her phone away when Mordecai returns)

Mordecai: Unbelievable! CJ, when you deleted your Couple Corral profile, did its CEO come to you in person and tell you to break up with me?

CJ: (Confused) No.

Mordecai: Ugh. Let's just enjoy dinner.

(Transition to after dinner. Mordecai and CJ have clean dinner plates in front of them.)

Mordecai: Man, that steak was off the hook!

CJ: Yeah, this was so good.

Mordecai: Ready for dessert? (Snaps his fingers) Garcon!

(A waiter walks over with Mordecai's gift box hidden under a serving dish. CJ's phone vibrates with an incoming call from L'Wafflerie.)

CJ: You know what? Let's skip dessert.

Mordecai: What?

CJ: Uh, I... (She stands up) ...gotta go to the bathroom. Excuse me.

(CJ walks away, passing the waiter Mordecai called over. The waiter looks confusedly at Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Uh...

(A car's high beams shine through the window and its horn plays "La Cucaracha". Mordecai looks out the window and sees McIntyre.)

McIntyre: Hey, Mordecai! Wanna meet a girl that doesn't have to go to the bathroom? Call me!

(Mordecai looks angry. Circle-wipe to later on; Mordecai and CJ are leaving the restaurant.)

Mordecai: Hey, I'll catch up. Gotta tie my shoe real quick.

CJ: I can wait.

Mordecai: No! Uh... it's better if I have privacy.

CJ: (Confused) Uh... okay.

(CJ walks off-screen as Mordecai bends down to "tie his shoe". With CJ out of earshot, Mordecai takes out his phone and calls Rigby.)

Rigby: Talk to Rig.

Mordecai: Dude, the dessert plan failed.

Rigby: Whaaaat?

Mordecai: I need you to pick up the bracelet at the restaurant and bring it to the Koffee Kiosk in the square.

Rigby: I'm on it.

(Mordecai catches up with CJ)

Mordecai: Sorry about that. I just wanted to try out this new knot.

CJ: Okay.

(She chuckles)

Mordecai: Do you mind actually if we cut over to Main Street?

CJ: Well... (Stuttering)

(The screen cuts to a shot behind CJ. L'Wafflerie is across the street.)

CJ: It's just that... Well, I was kinda hoping we could stay on this block.

Mordecai: Really? But Main Street's so much more romantic.

CJ: Um, hello? Dry cleaners, notary publics as far as the eye can see? This is where it's at.

Mordecai and CJ: (Laughing)

(Mordecai sighs and puts an arm around CJ. They walk forward a few feet, then Mordecai breaks into a run down the block.)

Mordecai: Race you to the square!

CJ: Huh? No!

(CJ takes out her phone and calls Eileen)

Eileen: Hey, what's up?

CJ: Waffle plan's been jacked. I need backup.

Eileen: Copy that. What do I do?

CJ: I need you to pick up the waffle cake and meet me by the big fountain in town square.

Eileen: I'm on it.

(They both hang up. Cut to Mordecai running down the street. CJ quickly catches up with him...)

CJ: You're pretty fast, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Huh?

(...and pulls into the lead.)

CJ: Not fast enough!

(Their race ends in front of the town square water fountain)

CJ: Woo-hoo! I win!

Mordecai: (Out of breath) That's not fair. You exercise. Let me just get a cup of coffee. Then I bet I can outrun you.

CJ: (She elbows Mordecai) Face it, dude. You lost. Come on. (She takes Mordecai by the hand) Let's go make a wish in the fountain. You can wish to be faster at running.

(Rigby stands by the Koffee Kiosk with the bracelet.)

Rigby: Dude!

(Mordecai waves to Rigby, and Rigby starts walking over. Mordecai takes out a coin.)

Mordecai: Okay, here I go. (closes his eyes) I wish... for a cute girlfriend who likes me back.

(Mordecai and CJ laugh as he flips the coin. The screen follows the coin as it travels up into the air and stops on McIntyre's blimp.)

McIntyre: Dump Cloudy Jay!

(Mordecai is in shock as the coin splashes into the fountain.)

CJ: Is he watching us?

Mordecai: Let's get out of here.

(Rigby walks up to the fountain, and Mordecai and CJ are gone)

Rigby: Argh! Come on, dude! Stick to the plan!

Eileen: Rigby?

(Eileen appears behind Rigby with the waffle cake)

Rigby: Eileen? What are you doing here? Are you gonna eat that by yourself?

Eileen: (Shaking her head) I'm doing a favor for CJ. Did you... buy jewelry?

Rigby: Ugh. No. I'm doing a favor for Mordecai.

Eileen: Wait...

(Eileen narrows her eyes, then Rigby narrows his eyes. Cut to Mordecai and CJ by the Koffee Kiosk.)

Mordecai: I think we're safe. You want a coffee?

CJ: I'm good. You?

Mordecai: Nah.

(A brief pause, then Mordecai and CJ talk over each other)

Mordecai: I think I left something at the fountain.

CJ: Uh, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

(They walk to opposite ends of the kiosk and take out their phones to call Rigby and Eileen.)

Mordecai: Rigby!

CJ: Eileen!

Rigby and Eileen: New plan.

Rigby: Come to the pier by the waterfront.

Eileen: You can get your present there.

Rigby and Eileen: Over and out.

(Mordecai and CJ hang up and walk back over to each other)

Mordecai and CJ: Let's go to the waterfront.

(Scene transitions to the waterfront amusement park)

Mordecai: Well, here we are at the waterfront.

CJ: Yup. All sorts of surprising, romantic stuff happens here.

(Mordecai and CJ stop and gasp, looking at a candlelit table setting with their gifts on the table)

Mordecai and CJ: Whoa.

(As they run over to the table, Rigby and Eileen are seen hiding inside a crate)

Mordecai and CJ: For me? So that's why you were acting all... And that's why you made all those...

Mordecai: Excuses.

(Mordecai and CJ begin to laugh)

CJ: Tying your shoe?

Mordecai: Going to the bathroom. I was calling Rigby.

CJ: I was calling Eileen!

(As Mordecai and CJ laugh together, Rigby and Eileen watch and bump fists)

Mordecai: I'm sorry this wasn't more romantic.

CJ: This is the most romantic date I've ever been on.

Mordecai: (He goes wide-eyed) Really?

(CJ goes wide-eyed as well and nods her head. She and Mordecai move in for a kiss, but they're interrupted when the pier shakes.)

Mordecai: Something hit the pier!

(They run up to the edge of the pier, and McIntyre's submarine rises out of the water. The hatch opens and McIntyre comes out.)

McIntyre: Last chance, Mordecai! Break up with her!

Mordecai: Dude, what's your deal?! Aren't we the point of your site? Shouldn't you want us to stay together?

McIntyre: (He sighs and shakes his head) Whoever here knows how to run a website, raise their hand. (He raises his hand) Happy couples don't use Couple Corral; lonely people do! Lonely people lead to subscribers. Subscribers lead to more clicks. More clicks somehow lead to millions of dollars. Millions of dollars lead to sweet corporate-branded stuff. See?! (He gestures to his blimp and begins to sob) My site's too good! There's nobody left! Happy couples have been leavin' in droves! I'm bankrupt!

CJ: Dude, just sell your stuff!

McIntyre: No! My crooked lawyer told me this is the only way! Break up with her!

Mordecai: No way! We're really into each other!

McIntyre: If you won't break up with her... (Takes out a bazooka) ...I'll do it for ya. Let me introduce you to the Couple Corral "Breakup-ulator".

(Mordecai and CJ scream in terror as McIntyre takes aim at CJ. He fires a missile with "It's not you, it's me." written on its side.)

Mordecai: Look out!

(Mordecai pushes CJ out of the way of the missile, and it explodes into the pier. CJ falls back, and Mordecai's body rolls onto the beach. He lies lifeless with CJ's gift in his hand with bruises and scrapes on him along with his hair and suit cut up a little and messed up.)

CJ: Mordecai!

(She glares angrily at McIntyre)

McIntyre: Well, darn. That didn't work out like I wanted it to. CJ! Rejoin my site?

(CJ's eyes turn red, and she begins breathing heavily)

McIntyre: Uh-oh.

CJ: NO!!!

(CJ turns into a giant gray storm cloud, leaving her clothes behind. The water around McIntyre becomes turbulent.)

CJ: LEAVE... US... ALONE!!!

(Lightning strikes the pier under McIntyre's car, and it falls onto a gas tank and explodes. The car's bull horn-shaped hood ornament flies up into McIntyre's blimp, rupturing it. The blimp plummets down toward McIntyre's submarine.)

McIntyre: Hubris!

(An explosion destroys the blimp and submarine and kills McIntyre. Transition to CJ, back to normal, crying over Mordecai's body with his head on her lap.)

CJ: (Sobbing) Mordecai... Mordecai... Mordecai... No!!!

(As CJ holds Mordecai, her tears splash onto his face and CJ hugged his head. Then Mordecai began to cough and groan)

CJ: (Gasp) Mordecai?! (they hugged each other) I thought you were dead!

Mordecai: (He sits upright) I would be... if not for this gift box. I hope you like it.

(Mordecai opens the box. The charm bracelet now only has a single charm on it shaped like a heart.)

(CJ gasps slowly)

Mordecai: There's a different charm for- (Looks at the new bracelet) Whoa! Well, there used to be different charms. I guess they must've all gotten welded into a heart by the bazooka blast.

(CJ puts the bracelet on her left wrist)

CJ: I love it.

Mordecai: I thought that you would.

CJ: I guess the thing I had for you must've exploded.

Mordecai: That's okay. I got my wish.

CJ: What, that you can run faster than me?

Mordecai: No, for a cute girlfriend that likes-

(CJ cuts him off with a kiss as the sun rises in the background. Cut to Rigby and Eileen. Eileen is holding the waffle cake and gives it to Rigby, who's holding a fork.)

Rigby: (Gasp) Is this waffles and a cake and chocolate?

Eileen: Yeah.

(Rigby takes a bite of the cake)

Rigby: I love it.

Eileen: I thought that you would.

(End of Real Date)

This is the transcript page for "Regular Show (Pilot)"

(Mordecai opens a refrigerator)

Mordecai: Milk...

(Rigby opens a cupboard) 

Rigby: Cereal...

(They are both at the table and they both pour the milk and cereal into a bowl)

Mordecai & Rigby: ...Combine. 

(Cut to a space background with text saying "REGULAR SHOW CREATED BY J.G. QUINTEL". As movement can be heard, it cuts back to the kitchen. Rigby is about to eat the cereal, but Mordecai stops him)

Mordecai: (picks up a spoon) This is the only clean spoon left, dude. Let's play "punchies" for it.

Rigby: Okay. Me first. 

(Rigby punches Mordecai, but Rigby is shocked at how weak his punch was) 

Mordecai: (starts laughing, then punches Rigby harder) 

Rigby: (rubs his arm) Owww... take it.

(Rigby moves to the other side of the table as Mordecai laughs and starts eating his breakfast) 

Mordecai: (stops eating) Man, so far, this job is awesome. I still can't believe we have our own rooms.

Rigby: Dude, those rooms aren't cool. There's nothing in them. I had to sleep on the floor last night. (starts pouring cereal into his mouth) 

Mordecai: Well, yeah. But, I mean, we can go get stuff for it after we make some money. Ya know?

Rigby: (with cereal in his mouth) Yeah, I guess. 

Mordecai: You want some milk? 

Rigby: Yeah. 

(Mordecai starts pouring milk into Rigby's mouth, but he gets interrupted by Benson and starts pouring the milk on Rigby's head) 

Benson: Hey! (the scene moves to Benson and Pops carrying a chair out of the door) Please, don't eat up on the table like that! 

Pops: Like what? (The scene then zooms into the chair, as angelic music starts to play. The scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby, staring at the chair as Mordecai is still pouring the milk on Rigby's head) Oh my, I've never seen anyone eat cereal like that. How quaint.

(They're watching them walking with the couch)

Benson: Yeah, they shouldn't be doing that. That's what the bowls are for.

Pops: Oh, they're fine.

(Benson & Pops leave the room)

Mordecai: Did you see that chair?

Rigby: I love chairs...

(Mordecai & Rigby look at each other at the moment then run outside to see the chair)

Mordecai: Hey Pops, what are you doing with that chair?

Pops: Oh well, I no longer require its services. So Benson and I, are taking it to the place where the big man-made come upon it and whisk it away to magic trash city!

(They stare at him then look at Benson)

Benson: We're throwing it away.

Rigby: Aww, what?

Mordecai: Can we at least check it out before you chuck it?

(Rigby hangs onto the chair)

Rigby: Yeah, let us check it before you chuck it?

(Benson & Pops put the chair down)

Pops: (laughs) Well, that would be fine.

(Rigby laughs.)

Mordecai: Yeah...

Benson: Look, I gotta get back to work. You guys help him throw it away when you're done.

(Benson leaves the scene while Mordecai & Rigby come closer to the chair.)

Mordecai: Aw, man this chair is awesome. Look how awesome it looks.

Rigby: Dude, it sounds like old man pants.

(They both feel the couch which makes a cushion sound)

Mordecai: (laughs) I'm gonna sit in it.

Rigby: Good idea.

(Mordecai sits on the couch while awing. Later, he then feels uncomfortable.)

Rigby: What? What's wrong?

Mordecai:  This is the most uncomfortable chair I ever sat in.

Rigby: Aw, what? Let me try.

Pops: Yes, I'm afraid it's true, I purchased it through the post, and it just isn't as comfortable as it looks.

Rigby: Awwwwwww. This is terrible. Maybe we're just not sitting it right.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm.

Rigby: Come on baby, come on baby, come on! Come on baby!!!

(Rigby pull his eyes and bites the chair and sits on the chair)

Rigby: It's just not comfortable, man.

Mordecai: Hey Pops, since you're throwing it out anyway, can I just have it?

Rigby: No, let me have it!

Mordecai: I asked him first. Come on, Pops!

Rigby: No, Pops, me!

Pops: Well, I don't think I know who to give it to. But if you two can settle it between yourselves, then you're more than welcome to have it.

Mordecai: Yeah, let's play punchies.

Rigby: No way! I'm not playing that game with you anymore. If we're playing for something like that chair, then we need to play a game that takes a little more skill.

Mordecai: How much skill?

Rigby: Rock paper scissors. (Spins around Mordecai)

Pops: Oh, I adore rock paper scissors. Although where I come from, we called it quartz parchment shears.

Mordecai: Alright, fine. Ready?

Rigby: Hmm.

(Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears one tie)

Pops: Oh my!

(Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears two ties and Pops laugh)

Benson: Shouldn't you guys be throwing that thing away?

Pops: Benson, come quick! Quartz parchment shears and they already tied two times, it's absolutely fascinating!

Benson: I have work to do. They shouldn't be playing that. It's an evil game.

Pops: Whoo, an evil game.

Rigby: Two ties. You don't know what I'm throwing next, baby.

Mordecai: Pfft! I already know what you're gonna throw before you even throw it, baby.

Rigby: That's not even possible, baby!

(Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears eight ties and Pops watches in amazement; Rigby kicks the dirt)

Mordecai: Come on... (He walks away)

Pops: Good show! Jolly good show!

(Montage begins where Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears 99 ties and Pops watches in shock until the montage ends. A crowd of people are yelling as they watch Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears)

Rigby: La la la la la la la la!

Mordecai: No! No!

Pops: Ninety-nine times in a row! (laughs)

Mordecai: Enough! Why are we even doing this?! You don't think this chair is comfortable!

Rigby: So?! Neither do you!

Mordecai: Dude, I was lying. I was just saying it so you wouldn't want it.

Rigby: I was lying also. I love that chair.

Mordecai: Well, then, I guess it's too bad that after I win it, I'm never gonna let you sit in it.

Rigby: (groans) Then finish it!

(Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears 100 ties, but lightning strikes and an evil voice laughing is heard from the sky)

Evil Voice: Since no one can decide, and all that's played is tied 100 times, I'd take it upon myself to eat your prize.

(A black hole appears in front of them, and the people run to the house for safety)

Rigby: What is that?!

Mordecai: Come on, let's go!

(They go to the house for safety, except a businessman, who gets sucked into the black hole)

Rigby: This is all your fault!

Mordecai: How is this my fault?! I just wanted to play punchies!

(They see the chair about to be sucked into the black hole)

Rigby: The chair! (He goes after the chair)

Mordecai: Rigby! (He goes after Rigby)

Pops: Oh? Oh! Oh, dear! (He goes after the duo to save the chair)

(Cut to a different area of the park where Benson and Skips are driving in the cart)

Pops: (over the speaker) Hello, hello?! Please, someone, come quick! Quartz parchment shears gone terribly- (The speaker dies)

Benson: Pops, where are you? (He and Skips see an explosion behind the bushes; sighs) Skips, take the shortcut, I'll go around back.

Skips: Hmm!

(He takes the shortcut through the bushes and Benson drives the cart back to the guys)

Benson: Idiots.

(Rigby, Mordecai, and Pops hold on a lamppost as they're screaming, trying to save the chair, but the black hole monster reveals itself and roars and goes back into the black hole, and it gets bigger and stronger, making Pops let go of the lamppost, and as the trio are about to be sucked into the black hole, Skips grabs Pops' legs)

Pops: Skips!

Skips: What did you do?!

Benson: (he came with the cart) They were playing rock paper scissors, grab on.

Skips: (he grabs on a bar) Don't you know? That's an evil game!

Benson: Hold on, everybody.

Pops: Hold on, everybody!

Mordecai: Hold on, every... Rigby!

(Half of Rigby's body is sucked into the black hole along with the chair, Benson and Skips gasp, but Benson drives the cart towards the garage door, pulling half of Rigby's body and the chair out of the black hole, Benson continues driving until he hits the garage door)

Skips: What do we do?!

Benson: You have to break the tie!

Mordecai: Rigby, we have to end this! I'm gonna throw rock!

Rigby: Yeah, right!

Mordecai: I'm not kidding!

Benson: Hurry up! Do it now!

(Mordecai and Rigby break the tie, causing the black hole to explode, leaving the park ruined. Everybody gets up)

Mordecai: Did you win?

Rigby: (coughs)

Mordecai: I think you've won.

Rigby: (sighs) It doesn't matter. I wasn't able to hold on to the chair anyways.

Pops: Look!

(Half of the chair is still left)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aww, cool.

Benson: No you don't! You're not getting that chair. But here's what you do get. You get to flip that cart back over, you're throwin' that chair away, and then you're cleaning up this whole MESS!! Pops, you're comin' with me. And you two idiots, if this isn't cleaned up when I get back, YOU'RE FIRED!!!

(Benson walks into the house with Pops and Skips)

Mordecai: Rock paper scissors for who gets to drive the cart?

(End of Pilot)

(The episode begins with screenshots of the house, which is completely trashed. The phone starts to ring.)

Answering Machine (Pops's voice): Hello. You've reached the park. Leave a message at the sound of the beep, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

Margaret: Hey, Mordecai; it's Margaret. I was just calling to say that we had a really great time last night. You guys are really good at throwing pizza parties.

Eileen: (In the background) Tell him that Rigby was really funny as the Pizza King.

Margaret: Oh, and Eileen wanted me to ask you to tell Rigby that he was really funny as the Pizza King.

(Mordecai and Margaret laugh)

Both: So stupid.

Margaret: Well, see you later.

(Dial tone)

(Mordecai looks at the clock and checks the time and alarm. The time is 8:30 A.M while the alarm reads 6:40 P.M.)

Mordecai: Oh, dude. Wake up, dude! We're late!

Rigby: Huh?

Mordecai: Dude, come on! We got to clean this place up. We were supposed to meet Benson at the paddleboats two hours ago!

Rigby: But I set an alarm...

Mordecai: Yeah, but for six p.m. instead of six a.m., you idiot.

Rigby: Aw, man... Pizza King not happy.

(A montage of cleaning starts)

Mordecai: Don't forget the water.

Rigby: (Mocking) Don't forget the water. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Mordecai: Let's go!

(They both leave the house in the cart)

Rigby: Dude, we're getting pretty good at throwing pizza parties.

Mordecai: Uh, yeah. But that's not a good thing. We're late for work!

Rigby: Don't worry. Benson'll just yell at us, and then we can go back to work.

Mordecai: Normally, I'd be all, "Everything will be fine after Benson yells at us," but we've been late for our past five jobs, and I think he's starting to get sick of it.

Rigby: Oh, yeah. Maybe he won't be there yet, and we can clean the boats before he finds out.

Mordecai: (Gasps) Dude, who is Benson talking to?

(Mordecai and Rigby spy on Benson through the bushes)

Benson: Alright, Chad and Jeremy. So, I just need you to clean all the paddleboats, and check to make sure that they're all in working order. Oh, and I'm going to need that done by the end of the day.

Jeremy: Not a problem.

Benson: Well, no. It is your problem because- Wait. Did you just say, "Not a problem?"

Jeremy: Yeah, doesn't seem like that hard of a job. I'm sending you a boat cleaning schedule.

Chad: All right.

Jeremy: Got it?

Chad: Yeah, I got it.

Jeremy: Are you sure?

Chad: Yeah. I'm sending a confirmation email that I got it. Did you get it?

Jeremy: Yeah, I just got it.

Chad: All right, we're good. We should be able to finish these boats by this afternoon.

(Benson begins to laugh)

Jeremy: I'm sorry. Are we missing something?

Benson: Oh, no. It's not you. I'm just not used to hearing employees talk like that.

Chad: Sounds like you need new employees.

Benson: (Laughs) Yes. It does sound like I need new employees, doesn't it? And that's where you come in. I think there might be two positions opening up real soon, and if you guys can finish up these boats by five, those two positions will definitely be opening up.

Mordecai: Dude, Benson's totally gonna fire us!

Rigby: What'll we do?

Mordecai: I don't know, but we have to figure something out quick! Come on. Let's go.

(Rigby walks into Benson)

Rigby: Hey, Benson.

Mordecai: Yeah. Hey, Benson. We're sorry we're late. It won't happen again.

Benson: (Laughs) Yeah, I'm sure it won't. But you know what? Don't worry about it, fellas. Everybody makes mistakes. And then those people end up having to pay for those mistakes.

Mordecai: Uh... Well, we can start cleaning the boats.

Benson: No, no. Don't worry about the boats. Chad and Jeremy have it all under control.

Rigby: But cleaning the boats was our job.

Benson: Yeah. It was, wasn't it? Well, that ship has sailed. But look; it's okay. Once Chad and Jeremy finish up, I'll let you know what you can do next.

Mordecai: Do you just want to tell us now so we can get started?

Benson: No, no. I need to get a camera before I tell you, because I want to take a picture of your faces right when I tell you. I really don't want to forget the look on your faces when I tell you. See you later, guys.

(Whistles as he walks away)

Mordecai: Dude, he's totally gonna give our jobs away.

Rigby: Ahh! I don't want to lose my job! What are we gonna do?

Mordecai: The only thing we can do: we just have to figure out a way to stop those guys from doing a good job. That way, Benson won't have to hire them.

Rigby: Alright. What's the plan?

Mordecai: Remember "Two-headed Dinosaur vs. Robo-Bigfoot?"

Rigby: Robo? Oh. OHHH! Dude, they'll never be able to finish those boats!

Mordecai: Hhm! Hhm! No, they will not.

(A moment later)

Mordecai: Hey, guys. How you doing? I'm Mordecai, and this is Rigby.

Jeremy: Jeremy. Nice to meet you.

Chad: Chad. It's a pleasure.

Mordecai: Boat cleaning's a pain, huh?

Jeremy: Nah, not really.

Mordecai: Uh.. Rigby has a question for you.

Rigby: You both have to answer. Who would win in a fight: a two-headed dinosaur or a robotic Bigfoot?

Jeremy & Chad: (Simultaneously) Robotic Bigfoot.

Rigby: Really? One of you wouldn't have the opposite opinion and start arguing about it for three days?

Jeremy & Chad: Nope. Robotic Bigfoot.

Mordecai: What?! But Sasquatch is not a killer!

Jeremy: Maybe, but he'd definitely win in a fight with a dinosaur.

Mordecai: A two-headed dinosaur?

Chad: Two-headed or not.

Mordecai: But the dinosaur would be twice the size and made for fighting! Bigfoot doesn't have the killer instinct.

Jeremy: Three words, dude: Pea-sized brain.

Mordecai: What? Ugh! Dude, we gotta step up our game. They already cleaned half the boats. It'd be a shame if something bad happened and the boats got all dirty again.

Rigby: Yes, it would.

Both: Hhm-Hhm-Hhm-Hhm-Hhm!

(A montage shows Mordecai and Rigby's attempts to sabotage Chad and Jeremy)

Mordecai: (Pulling up in the cart with large bags) Hey, guys. Could you give us a hand with these bags?

(Mordecai, Rigby, Chad, and Jeremy bring a bag of compost to a paddleboat)

Jeremy: Wait. Why are we putting bags of compost on the paddleboats?

(The bag rips and compost spills all over the boat)

Jeremy: Oh, man! We just finished cleaning this one!

Rigby: Oops!

Chad: You ripped the bag on purpose!

Rigby: No, we didn't! It was already like that!

Chad: Then what's that knife doing in your hand?!

Rigby: Uh, that was already there.

Jeremy: Wait! Are you guys deliberately trying to sabotage us?

Rigby: What?! No!

Mordecai: What are you talking about?!

Jeremy: Okay, that's it! Get this bag out of here! Let go of the bag!

Rigby: No, you let go!

Jeremy: Let go!

(The bag rips entirely, spilling compost everywhere)

Chad: Aw, man! Look what you did!

Rigby: We didn't drop it! You guys dropped it!

Jeremy: Get lost!

Mordecai: Why should we get lost? We didn't do anything. If anyone should get lost, it should probably be you.

Jeremy: I said, "Get lost!"

(Shoves Mordecai)

Mordecai: Whoa, what are you doing?

Jeremy: I just shoved you. Now get out of here before this hand turns into a fist and I use it to punch you in the face.

Mordecai: Uh, let's go, Rigby.

Rigby: Dude, what was that all about?

Mordecai: I don't know. I don't want to fight them. I just want them to leave!

Rigby: Well, we can't show up with more compost. No; I think there's only one thing left we can do to get them to stop cleaning those boats.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Pizza party.

Mordecai: Dude, you're a genius.

(Rigby is in the house sending out e-vites for a pizza party at the lake)

Mordecai: Alright, the pizzas are on their way. Did you invite everyone?

Rigby: Yeah. I'm going through making sure to invite the coolest people.

Mordecai: Rigby, we don't have time for that. Invite everybody.

Rigby: Everybody?

Mordecai: Dude, this is our last chance. If this party isn't crazy enough to stop those guys from finishing those boats, then we're totally gonna get fired.

Rigby: Good point.

(Rigby clicks on the "Select All" button and then "Invite")

Rigby: I hope this works.

(Up-tempo music starts to play and people start heading towards the lake)

Rigby (continued): Dude, they don't stand a chance.

Mordecai: Ye-ah, they don't!

Both: Hhm-Hhm-Hhm-Hhm!

(A crowd of people start to party and loud music plays. Chad and Jeremy continue to work and seem oblivious to the party.)

Rigby: Dude, it's not working!

Mordecai: Don't worry. They're not gonna be able to resist this party in three.. two.. one.

(A pizza delivery man drives by)

Pizza Delivery Man: Yo, did anybody order some pizzas?

(Everyone starts to cheer and chatter, grabbing pizza slices. Chad and Jeremy are still working, ignoring the party and noise.)

Mordecai: Crank it.

(Rigby increases the volume of the music, and the speakers start to vibrate and eventually fall into the lake. Many lake monsters come up from the water and join the party.)

Purple Lake Monster: Pizza party, up in here! Alright!

(A large brown monster is sitting on a paddleboat, irritating Chad and Jeremy)

Jeremy: Get off of that! We just cleaned it!

Brown Lake Monster: (Laughs) Anyway, as I was saying...

(Three people start partying in a paddleboat and drop a large pizza in the boat)

Jeremy: Hey, knock it off! We just cleaned those!

Partygoer: Chill out and have a slice of pizza, narc! This is a party! Whoo!

(Jeremey and Chad look towards Mordecai and Rigby who stare back)

Jeremy: That's it! Dude, end this party now! We're trying to work!

Mordecai: And we're trying to keep our jobs.

Jeremy: What? By throwing some lame pizza party?

Purple Lake Monster: Did you hear that, bro? It sounds like he doesn't like your party. Are you gonna take that from him?

Mordecai: No?

Purple Lake Monster: Awesome.

(The monster pushes Mordecai into Jeremy and Jeremy punches Mordecai in the face)

Purple Lake Monster: Fight!

(Every partygoer starts to fight each other, from throwing pizzas to a lake monster being thrown into the boat house)

Chad: Hey, wanna see my phone?

(Chad's phone shows a text saying, "You're dead!" to Rigby and punches Rigby in the face. Jeremy and Mordecai start to fight each other until Benson drives over in the cart, an angry expression plastered on his face.)

Benson: ALRIGHT! THAT'S ENOUGH!

(Jeremy lets go of Mordecai and Chad gets off of Rigby)

Rigby: Hhm-Hhm-Hhm-Hhm-Hhm!

Benson: THIS PARTY'S OVER! THAT'S RIGHT! BEAT IT! I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY OF YOUR FACES HERE EVER AGAIN!

(To Mordecai and Rigby) 

Benson (continued): Uh, not you two. Mordecai and Rigby, you can get out BECAUSE YOU'RE FIRED! 

(Just as he said he would earlier on, he grabs his camera and takes the photograph.)

Rigby: But you were gonna give our jobs away!

Mordecai: We had to do something to stop them from finishing the boats!

Benson: Yeah, and a lot of goof that did you! NOW GET LOST! YOU'RE FIRED, REMEMBER?!

Rigby: But, Benson--

(Benson snaps a second photo.)

Benson: LEAVE, NOW!

Rigby: But-

Benson: (Begins running after Mordecai and Rigby as he takes a third photo) NOW, NOW, NOW! LEAVE, NOW! (He begins to calm down and slowly reverts to his normal color scheme.)

Benson (continued): Hey, Chad and Jeremy, looks like those positions opened up. So, what do you say? How would you like a job at the park?

Jeremy: (Scoffing) Yeah, right. We didn't get degrees in the Institute of Technical Technology to work at some crazy job like this.

Chad: Good luck finding two suckers dumb enough to take this job.

(Chad and Jeremy grab their phones, activate rockets in them, and fly away from the park)

Benson: Chad! Jeremy! Wait! But- I-

Mordecai: So.. Benson.. Not sure if you're looking, but we know a couple of dumb suckers who are real good at cleaning up pizza parties.

Rigby: Real good. (He pulls out his own camera and takes a picture of Benson's shocked face as we cut to black.) 

(End of Replaced)

(Episode begins by zooming out on a dandelion. Hi Five Ghost is holding it and blows it. A piece of it starts floating around; near a butterfly Pops is trying to catch, past Muscle Man and Starla who are sharing pie, through the winds over to Skips who is working on his Volkswagen, past a tree with a squirrel and birds, past a poster that says 'Come Celebrate Rigby's Graduation! This Sunday!', until it stops near Mr.Maellard, who shakes hands with Dr. Langer. Dr. Langer then takes off in his jetpack, the dust sending the dandelion floating again. It floats aways from the scientists and lands on Benson's car. One scientist is checking his briefcase as Benson appears.) 

Benson: Hey, what's going on?

Scientist: We're done. Dr. Langer gave us the order to pack up our stuff and move out.

Benson: Well, if you're all done, then that means Pam and I aren't working together anymore. I could ask her out on a date! Gotta find Pam!

(He gets into his car and drives off, causing the dandelion seed to float again. It floats in the air for a while before floating near the roof, where Mordecai and Rigby are playing a video game.)

Mordecai: Come on....Oh man, come on!

Rigby: Argh! No, no, no-

(The seed floats into his mouth, making him choke. He coughs it out.)

Mordecai: I win! Whooooaaaaa!

Rigby: Whatever! I don't even care, 'cause I'm graduating tommorrow. And we gon' par-tay!  You ready for my grad-party, duuuude?

Mordecai: Of course. I'm on the planning commitee.

Rigby: Cool, man. What a year. I've been learning and growing and doing so much, all while holding onto a steady girlfriend. I'm really amazing, y'know? Man, the rate I'm going, I'll probably get my college degree before you get yours.

(Rigby laughs. Mordecai does in a weak manner.)

Mordecai: Yeah. Well, in my past year I got really good at this video game.

(He holds up his controller with a grin. A phone is heard ringing.)

Rigby: Hold that thought, dude.

(He pull out his phone. Principal Dean is calling.)

Rigby: (continued) Principal Dean?

(He answers the call.)

Rigby: (continued) Hello? Come to school now? Deadly serious?

(He walks away, whispering to Mordecai.)

Rigby: (continued) I'll talk to you later.

Mordecai: "Oh, no. Graduation's cancelled. No graduation for Rigby!"

(He chuckles a bit, then sighs. He puts down his controller and crosses his arms, looking out. Cut to West Anderson High School. Rigby is with Principal Dean in his office)

Rigby: Come on, Principal Dean! You can't fail me!

Principal Dean: Who said anything about failing you?

Rigby: On the phone! You said it was "deadly serious".

Principal: Okay, I can see how that could sound ominous, but this is good news! Are you familiar with the television program "Inspire America!"?

Rigby: You mean that cheesy show with inspirational stories, then everyboby cries then everybody dances at the end?

Principal Dean: That's the one! See, Rigby, apparently you're an inspiration to this country. Most kids who drop out don't come back, but you did. So you, Rigby, are gonna give this year's graduation speech on TV.

Rigby: But graduation's tomorrow!

Principal Dean: (claps fist) Better get moving. Oh and Rigby...

(We get a close-up on Dean.)

Principal Dean: (continued) If you screw this up for me, I'm gonna eat your diploma.

(Rigby has a nervous and sweaty expression on his face. Dean suddenly points a finger.)

Principal Dean: (continued) Ha, I'm just pulling your chain. Actually, no, yeah. I will eat it.

(Rigby whimpers. Cut to Eileen's house. Mordecai, Margaret, Rigby and Eileen are watching "Inspire America!". The host, Flannery Shedlawn, is talking with an old lady.)

Flannery Shedlawn: And now back to Inspire America! Now, you have been baking cookies for lawyers for how many years now?

Old Lady: 37.

Flannery Shedlawn: An eternity! And it never occurred to you that lawyers probably make enough to buy cookies if they want them?

Old Lady: (shakes head) Never. Not once.

(Flannery sheds tears as he holds up a cookie.)

Flannery Shedlawn: Amazing. But more than amazing; inspiring. (turns to the camera) Say it with me folks: Inspire America!

(As the credit rolls, lawyers appear on the scene with Flannery and the old lady and start dancing.)

Margaret: (standing and tearing up) That was so inspirational! (starts dancing)

(Rigby whimpers.)

Eileen: Don't worry, Rigby. It's so cool you're gonna be on that show. I'm bummed I can't be there for your graduation because I'm graduating from college.

Rigby: No problem. We'll hang out at my party after. If I've learned anything from my extended high school education, it's that we have to seek beauty and truth in the ordinary. The greatest mistake a man can make is to search for flowers among the weeds, overlooking the fact that off at times, the very weeds are flowers.

Eileen: Wow, that's great. Is that the beginning of your speech?

Rigby: Pssh, no. But actually, you wanna hear what I got so far?

Mordecai: Sure, I guess.

Margaret: Totally.

Eileen: Of course!

Rigby: Okay, one sec.

(He walks out the door and turns off the lights. He puts a boom box into the room from outside, which plays music and Rigby's voice from a microphone.)

Rigby (voice from boom box): Teachers! [making a fake echo] Teachers, teachers... Students! Students, students... Other attendees! -Dees, -dees...

(Mordecai, Margaret and Eileen walk to the other side of the room.)

Rigby (continued): Puts your hands together for... 

(He opens the door. He is on a scooter and is wearing a helmet with sparklers on top.)

Rigby (continued): The... Rigbone!

(Margaret and Eileen clap unenthusiastically while Mordecai remains still with his arms crossed.)

(Rigby rides on the scooter into the room, the cord from the microphone reaching its end.)

(Suddenly the fax machine sent the paper to message.)

Benson: (reading) To end the experiment...push the button.

(Button's bolts come out as the glass opens.)

All: (shocked) Woah!

(Outside, where everyone's heading to the dome, while yelling: Party!, repeatedly.)

Benson: (sighs) The only way to find out.

(The gang put their hands to the button, cut to the gang's serious expressions as camera pans to one other.)

Benson: Let's end this.

(They all push the button. The ground starts to rumble as the sirens wail.)

Mordecai: What's happening?!

Skips: Get to the exit!

(The gang try to escape the dome as Muscle Man escapes on the cart. The doors start closing.)

Muscle Man: Tuck and roll!

(Muscle Man rolls around while squealing trying to escape, but is unsuccessful. The door closes, Skips tries to hit them with the garbage can, but it fails. Rigby digs his way out. The people arrive. and rocket launchers unleash from the underground and lifts the park dome right to the sky. Park crew screams as they've been lifted right to the air.)

Muscle Man: Starla!

Starla: Mitch!

Margaret: Mordecai?

Pam: (arrives with the wings) Hey has anyone seen Bens -

(She gasps in shock after seeing Benson in the air.)

Benson: Pam?

(As the dome lifts up to the air. Mr Maellard sheds a tear for his son as Dr. Langer enters.)

Dr Langer: Don't worry. He'll be safe.

(Mordecai's parents are shocked of witnessing the park lifted up to the air, followed by CJ, Mr. Ross, Doug Shablowski and Thomas. The park starts off his rockets they fly right to the space as they scream. But suddenly it's stops. They are shocked that they're in space.)

Benson:  But, I had a date.

(The door opens, revealing Eileen with a banana souffle.)

Eileen: Surprise, Rigby! I made your favourite dessert. Banana souffle...

(She is shocked that she is in space with the others. The Banana souffle deflates.)

Eileen: Guys, what's going on?

(The park dome disappears into the sun)

(End of Rigby's Graduation Day Special)

(Episode begins at West Anderson High School. Cut to the cafeteria.)

Jayla:  I cannot wait for prom.

Allison:  Oh, I know! I hope Alvy asks me.

Kim:  Eww! Alvy Scimmelphening?

Allison:  What? I think he's cute. (turns to Rigby) What about you, Rigby, did you ask your girlfriend to prom?

Rigby:  Yeah.

Kim:  Was it romantic?

Rigby:  It was totally romantic. (Flashback to Rigby and Eileen at the Coffee Shop eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches) Hey, you wanna go with me to prom?

Eileen:  Like, as a chaperone?

Rigby:  No, as my date.

Eileen:  Oh, totally. I never got to go since no one ever asked me.

Rigby:  Nice.

(The two return to eating their sandwiches as the flashback ends)

Girls:  Awww!

Aiden:  So, what kind of ride we talking here? Limo, hog, hot rod, what?

Rigby:  Oh, uh, we're just gonna take the bus.

(Aiden and the girls laugh)

Aiden:  Good one, bro. If somebody actually showed up in a bus, they'd look like such a loser. Man, Rigby's jokes are so good.

Rigby:  Heh heh, yep, just another one of my jokes.

(Circle-wipe transitions to the Park where Skips is washing his van as Rigby walks to him)

Rigby:  Hey, Skips. Can I borrow your car for prom?

Skips:  (turns to Rigby) It's a van, and no.

(Cut to Benson in his office)

Benson:  Hmm, let me think. (turns red) NO!

(Cut to Muscle Man at his trailer)

Muscle Man:  No.

(Cut to Mordecai in his and Rigby's room)

Mordecai:  Rigby, you know I don't I have a car.

(Cut to Don at his house)

Don:  Sure, anything for my big bro. Give me some sugar first. (Rigby sighs and gives Don a hug) There's just one problemo, you totaled my car last week.

Rigby:  Augh! You mean I just gave you sugar for nothing?

Don:  Yeah, I've been riding the old recumbo to work every day. (shows him his recumbent bike) I gotta say, It's working miracles on my calves. (shows him his claves on his legs)

Rigby:  (sighs) Well, great, you were my last shot. There goes prom. Thanks for nothing. (starts to walk away)

Don:  Hey, hey. Hey, hold up. There's still someone you could ask.

Rigby:  (turns to Don) No.

Don:  Bro...

Rigby:  No!

Don:  Bro...

Rigby:  NO!!

(We cut to them at their parents' house where a picture of Sherm, Rigby and Don's father, washing his car is shown and the camera pans out to Sherm polishing his picture)

Rigby:  (softly) No.

Don:  Bro...

Sherm:  Would you two pipe down?! I'm trying to polish my picture of my prized car!

Barbara:  (comes in with two plates of food and sets them down to Don and Rigby) What a surprise for you boys to drop in!

Sherm:  "Drop in". Ha! You really think Rigby would just come to dinner? I know you just need something.

Barbara:  (sits down) Oh, hush, Sherm. (to Rigby and Don) So, how are things at work?

Don:  Great! We just picked up Cheezer's as a new client.

Sherm:  That's our Donny!

Rigby:  I ate at Cheezer's yesterday.

(Beat)

Sherm:  That was a good update, Don.

(They settle in and eat their dinner, except Rigby)

Rigby:  Yeah, so, anyway, I just got all my credits for high school. Yep, getting ready to graduate. (clears his throat) Moving up, accomplishing stuff. (Don elbows him) In fact, I'm, um, actually going to prom... with Eileen. You know Eileen.

Sherm:  Yeah, and?

Rigby:  That's it. (Don elbows him again) And I was wondering if I could borrow your car.

Sherm:  Oh ho ho! There it is! Now, it comes out! See, Barbara? Of course he needs something! No, you cannot borrow my prized 1964 Luxury Sedan!

Rigby:  Augh! This is so typical! You care more about that dumb car than you care about me!

Sherm:  THAT'S IT, GO TO YOUR ROOM!!!

Rigby:  FINE!!!! (goes to his room)

Sherm:  So, Don, you ready for some dessert?

Barbara:  (sighs and comes upstairs and knocks on the door that says "Rigby's Room!!!") Rigby, you this is a walk-in closet now. (opens the closet to find Rigby sitting there)

Rigby:  I know.

Barbara:  (walks to him with a tissue) I brought some tissues.

Rigby:  I'm not crying.

Barbara:  Oh, good. (sits down next to him)

Rigby:  (sighs) Why does Dad still have to be such a jerk all the time? It's just, neither me or Eileen went to prom, and I want it to make it special.

Barbara:  Hmm. Alright, I'll make you a deal. (takes out Sherm's car keys as Rigby gasps) No scratches, and I'm not involved. (gives the car keys to him)

Rigby:  Thanks, Mom.

Barbara:  You show that girl a good time. (leaves the closet)

Rigby:  I will, Mom.

(Scene circle-wipes to Rigby driving his dad's car to Eileen's house and knocks on her door as Eileen, in her prom outfit, answers it. Rigby smiles and puts a floral bracelet on her wrist)

Eileen:  Wow, hydrangea macrophylia, my favorite! (sees Sherm's car) Whoa, who lent you that thing? (goes to the car)

Rigby:  My dad. Pretty cool, right?

Eileen:  Wow, that was nice of him. Let's go crazy like teens!

Rigby:  (chuckles) But not too crazy, you know, 'cause of my dad's car.

Eileen:  Hmm?

(Scene cuts to prom night at West Anderson High School. Rigby and Eileen walk as he gives the car keys to a valet)

Rigby:  Now, be careful.

Eileen:  Come on, let's have fun!

(They run inside the school's gymnasium as they pose silly for their prom picture and dance on the dance floor with the other prom dates with Mrs. Kessler as the DJ playing music. Rigby and Eileen dance to funk music, which draws the students' attention and cheer at them)

Aiden:  (offscreen) Hey, Rigbone.

Rigby:  Yeah, Jablonski?

Aiden:  A bunch of us are gonna go hang out at Lookout Mountain. See you there.

Rigby:  Cool.

Eileen:  Ooh! Lookout Mountain. That sounds fun, huh? Let's go get the car! (leaves)

Rigby:  The car. Oh, right.

(Scene cuts to Rigby's parents' house where Sherm and Barbara are in their room as Sherm is trying to fix a small TV and Barbara is reading a book)

Sherm:  (groans) Darn tiny TV! Can't fix it! Why can't you be more like your brother, the big TV downstairs?

Barbara:  Sherm, I can't help but hear some metaphors in your insane ranting.

Sherm:  Barb, you're killing me with this psychobabble! I'm gonna go get my 318. (goes to the garage to find his car gone) RIGBY!!!!

(Scene cuts to Rigby driving Eileen up the mountain, looking nervously)

Eileen:  Are you okay? It looks like you're stewing. Rigby, please tell me what are you stewing about?

Rigby:  My dad didn't loan me the car.

Eileen:  What? You didn't steal it, did you?

Rigby:  No, my mom gave me the keys, but it's my dad, you know? He doesn't trust me with anything. I was hoping he'd finally ready to see me as a real person. (raises his arm and lowers it at each category he says) It's always Don, car, everything else, me.

Eileen:  I know how you feel. My mom can get pushy, too, but she still cares. I'm sure your dad cares, too. There's no way this is more important to him than your happiness.

(Scene cuts to the prom at West Anderson High School where Sherm bursts through the doors looking for Rigby and his car while the prom dates looks at him skeptically)

Sherm:  WHERE'S MY CAR?!?!? IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME!!!! (starts searching the gym for Rigby) WHERE'S RIGBY?!?! (runs to a prom couple) You seen Rigby?! I'm his father! He's the grown adult who goes to school! (the prom couple shrug) Usless! (continues to search) WHERE'S RIGBY?!?!?

Male Prom Date #1:  Who let a homeless guy in here?

Sherm:  I'M HIS FATHER!!!!

Feale Prom Date:  He's not wearing any pants.

Sherm:  I'M HIS FATHER!!!! (runs to Principal Dean) Where's Rigby?!

Principal Dean:  Rigby was here? Augh! I gave him all his credits and I still can't get rid of him!

Sherm and Principal Dean:  I CAN'T STAND HIM!!!!

Sherm:  RAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! (continues to search as Milton talks to his prom date)

Milton:  So, do you like prom?

Sherm:  (grabs Milton by the suit) WHERE'S RIGBY?!?! I'M GONNA KILL HIM!!!!!

Milton:  Oh, please be careful. This is my dad's suit. He cherishes it, but he let me borrow it just for tonight because he really really loves me.

Sherm:  You're not making any sense! Where's my son?!

Milton:  (stuttering) I think he and the guys went to Lookout Mountain!

Sherm:  Take me there!

(Scene cuts to Lookout Mountain where Aiden throws rocks at a sign that says "No Parking After 7 PM" while Rigby, Eileen and the other prom dates are relaxing on their cars and looking up the night sky)

Aiden:  Yes! This never gets old! (throws another rock at the sign)

Tony:  Do you ever look out at the night sky and think about how each one of those stars represents the infinite possibilities of our lives?

Eileen:  Why, yes, Tony, I do.

Aiden:  Shove it, Tony! (laughs with the prom dates) Yo, Rigby, sweet wheels. They yours, bro?

Rigby:  Uh... (sees Sherm and Milton driving to them)

Sherm:  No, they're my wheels! RAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! (jumps out of Milton's car and runs to Rigby)

Rigby:  Dad! What are you doing here?!

Sherm:  I'm taking back my stolen car from my no-good son!

Male Prom Date #2:  Why's Rigby's dad in his underwear?

Sherm:  (points to Tony and his prom date) You kids, get off my car! (points to Rigby and Eileen) You two, get in! Prom is over!

(He gets in car and activates the water in the windshield wipers to make Tony, Eileen and Rigby get off his car)

Tony:  Bye, Rigby.

Aiden:  Uh, good luck, man.

(Sherm drives off with Rigby and Eileen)

Sherm:  Rigby... Oh ho ho ho ho, Rigby. (to Eileen) Eileen, close your ears. (Eileen grabs ear muffs and puts them over her ears)  I always knew you were a liar and a loser, but I never thought you'd be a thief! I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Seems like every day you find some new way to mess up our lives, and now, you've found someone new to mess up their life, too!

Rigby:  What?!

Sherm:  You heard me!

Eileen:  Look out!

Rigby, Eileen and Sherm:  AAAHHH!!!

(Sherm drives off the road though a guardrail and roll down the hill until they hit a tree near a cliff)

Sherm:  Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! AAHH!!!

Eileen:  I'm just gonna go ahead and take these off, now. (takes off her ear muffs)

(Milton, Aiden and the prom dates run towards the guardrail)

Milton:  Rigby!

Sherm:  Oh, no, this is really high!

Rigby:  (unbuckles himself) Dad, give me the wheel!

Sherm:  Rigby, now's not the time to-- (the car moves a little more) AAH! Rigby! And look what you did to the windshield!

Rigby:  Dad, are you serious right now? Dad, I do stuff like this all the time. Just let me help!

Sherm:  Of course you do stuff like this all the time. (gasping) It's, uh... uh... it's your fault we're here in the first place! (continues gasping)

Rigby:  Augh! Dad, stop! It doesn't matter if I ever get a big job or my G.E.D. You're still never gonna trust me, and that's on you! You're so focused on your car, you never noticed me growing up! Also, it's totally your fault 'cause you were the one driving and you weren't watching the road! (grabs the wheel) Now, give me the wheel!

Sherm:  No, it's my car, you'll crash it!

Rigby:  (grunts) Give it!

(They continue to struggle for the wheel until Eileen grabs Sherm's arms)

Sherm:  Eileen, you, too?

Eileen:  I'm doing this for your own good, sir. (pulls Sherm to where Rigby was sitting)

Sherm:  NOOOOO!!!!!

Rigby:  (moves to the driver's seat) Thanks, Eileen. (buckles himself) I promise I won't mess this up.

(Rigby starts driving as they fall off the cliff and he drives off a chasm and continues driving down the hill)

Sherm:  AAH! Go left, go left! AAH! Not right! AAH!

(Rigby flips the car off another chasm and continues driving as Milton, Aiden and the prom dates cheer)

Sherm: AAAHH! huh? (sees Rigby still driving) Huh. (laughs) Go, go, go!

(The car hits huge rocks, which causes a rock slide and they get caught in the rock slide and fall off the cliff as they land on the ground, following the rocks)

Sherm:  (groans) Rigby?

Rigby:  (gasps) The car!

Sherm:  Forget about the car. Are you okay?

Rigby:  Um, yeah.

Sherm:  Eileen, you okay?

Eileen:  Yeah. (smiles)

(Circle-wipe transitions to Sherm, Rigby and Eileen out of the car)

Rigby:  Eileen, did you have a good time?

Eileen:  Oh, Rigby, that was the best and only prom I've ever been to! (hugs Rigby)

Sherm:  What you did back there was really impressive, Rigby. I mean, it showed initiative. Maybe you have changed. So, uh... I guess you can borrow the car whenever you want.

Rigby:  Thanks, Dad. (looks at the car) Though, I should probably get a driver's license first. (The car breaks into pieces)

(End of Rigby Goes to the Prom)

(Episode opens with Pops's House. Mordecai is looking through some letters. He turns around to see if there's anything behind him. Rigby peeks in through the hallway holding letters himself. Mordecai gets up and starts flinging postcards and letters at Rigby. He hides, then rolls to the side. He flings his at Mordecai, who dodges. He hops on top of the sofa, but Mordecai is gone. Mordecai rolls out from under the table, and they both fling letters at each other. Eventually Rigby falls off the sofa.)

Mordecai: The reign of your clan is over!

(He flings an envelope at Rigby, who gets up and holds up his hand in surrender.)

Rigby: For honor!

(He sticks the envelope at his body. Mordecai gets down for the sofa and pretends to slice him, and Rigby follows up by pretending to have committed seppuku.)

Rigby (continued): Samurai.

Mordecai: I thought we were ninjas.

Rigby: Eh, I'm winging it.

(He opens the envelope and takes out two papers.)

Rigby (continued): Hey, this one's for me! It's an invitation to our high school reunion.

Mordecai: No way, let me see that.

(He kneels next to him.)

Rigby: It says it's in two days.

Mordecai: What? So soon?

Rigby: We should totally go.

Mordecai: Ugh. Why? High school is so lame. Why would you wanna go back?

Rigby: Of course high school was uncool, I'm talking about how cool I was in high school, and how awesome it would be to show everyone I'm even cooler now. Here, follow me.

(They run upstairs laughing. Benson comes in and groans at the mess they left. In their room, Rigby takes out an old yearbook that says 'West Anderson High)

Mordecai: Whoa. I can't believe that you have this.

(Rigby flips over to the profiles and stops on a page.)

Rigby: Wo-ho-hoah! What do we have here?

(Rigby is looking at Mordecai's profile.)

Mordecai: Urrgh.

Rigby: "Activities - art club, dodgeball, jazz band"? Ha-ha! Oh yeah, you played the saxophone!

Mordecai: I signed up late and all the guitar spots were taken!

Rigby: That doesn't explain why you took your senior picture with it.

Mordecai: Well, yours can't be any better.

Rigby: We'll see about that.

(He starts flipping to it.)

Mordecai: I'm surprised you even got one since you didn't get your diploma.

Rigby: A-ha! Bam!

(He points to it. A picture of him riding a skateboard scooter is shown.)

Rigby (continued): Check out that photo.

(Mordecai points to something on the left page.)

Mordecai: Oh, right! It's your big To Do list! (reads) "A parting message for all you losers going to college. (takes yearbook) While you chumps write book reports and do math for 4 more years, I'm gonna be out having all the fun. Only jerks would choose more school."

(Flashback to Rigby's high school days. He is in the hallways with Mordecai talking to a girl)

Rigby: I'm gonna do way more cool stuff.

(Cut to him in the cafeteria.)

Rigby (continued): I'm gonna meet cool people! Go cool places and see cool things!

(Cut to him in the library.)

Rigby (continued): You're the ones who are gonna regret their choices!

(He gets tackled by security. Cut to him sitting outside the principal's office.)

Rigby (continued): I'll go to our reunion and rub it in your face, then you'l see!

(Cut to him talking to the principal.)

Rigby (continued): You'll all see! 

Barbara: You're always making so much trouble for yourself. Now, Don never gets in any trouble when he's at school.

Mordecai: Rigby out? Then you have a long list stuff you said you'll do. 

Rigby: Oh, no. Did I do anything on the list?

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: What do you mean? I can't go without doing something from the list? 

Mordecai: Just don't go then.

Rigby: No, I have to go. If I'm not there, they'll think I didn't do anything after high school and I'm just some loser in a dead-end job. I can't let those guys make fun of me! I've got to do something from the list!

Mordecai: Well, you only have two days, let's see what you can get done. None of time for you to become a famous heart surgeon. Hamboning for pope won't work. Get picture taken while mooning on all seven continents? That's actually really cool, but no. 

Rigby: Ugh! What about getting a slam dunk in the Olympics?

Mordecai: No.

Rigby: Kill a giant squid?

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: Having the world record for the largest feet in the world, and then kicking the biggest butt in the world?

Mordecai: Sorry, dude.

Rigby: Ugh! There's nothing on this list that I can do in time!

Mordecai: Hmm... What about this? Skydive while eating a burrito? You can probably do that in two days. Actually, that's the only one you can do in two days.

Rigby: Okay, then I'll do it! The sky doesn't know what's comin'. This is the place? 

Mordecai: This is the place. It's the only skydiving school from miles.

Jumping Jim: Hello? Welcome to Jumping Jim's Skydiving Academy. I'm Jumpin' Jim. And are you boys ready to fall in love with skydiving? (laughing)

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhhh...

Rigby: Look, I need you to teach me how to skydive before tomorrow. 

Jumpin' Jim: Oh, I see you got the real fire in your belly. Well, you bet I can. So let's get you straight to the fans. Now I'm gonna strap us together tandem-style.That way you'll get a feel for what it's like.

Rigby: I have to be strapped to you?

Jumpin' Jim: No one goes alone on their first jump. It just isn't done! Alright, let's get you suited up. Now I know what you're thinking, but don't look too down, son. Not all suits can be made of Chinese silk, real Italian suede, and embroidered in Iceland. But every jumper's got to start somewhere. Ha, ha!

Mordecai: Dude, burrito.

Rigby: Yeah, I gotta make sure I can get this right. Hit me. (Mordecai gives Rigby the burrito and puts it in his skydiving suit for safe keeping.)

Jumpin' Jim: Alright, here we go. Okay. when you're in the air, you want to stay focused. There's only a limited time-frame,- Whoa, son! What are you doing?

Rigby: Eating a burrito!

Jumpin' Jim: No! No snacks on the fan!

Mordecai: Rigby! (Rigby throws the burrito in the fan, making the blades of the fan shred it, and Rigby and Jumpin' Jim get covered to the goo condiments of the burrito. Then, Jumpin' Jim throws both Mordecai and Rigby out of his academy.)

Jumpin' Jim: Stay out of my school, and stay out of my sky!

Muscle Man: You know who else has done nothing since high school? MY MOM! Okay, for real, bro. If you got to go skydiving while eating a burrito, I've got this guy who owes me a favor. 

Muscle Man: His name is Johnny, he's got a plane and has been known to take people skydiving from time to time. I'll take you tomorrow after Starla and I finish brunch. And by brunch I mean...

Mordecai: Rigby changed his name to Trash Boat once. 

Rigby: Fine! As soon as I grab my stuff, we're hitting the sky! Alright, I got the parachute to live, got the burrito to eat, and the camera to prove it. That should be everything. 

Mordecai: Rigby, please don't do this! Just lie at the reunion, and tell people you did it. They'll never know!

Rigby: You know, maybe you're right, maybe they wouldn't. But I would. Johnny Skydiver, let's get this bird in the air! 

Mordecai: Dude, come on! 

Muscle Man: Let him go, bro.

Johnny: Anyway, the jump site's coming up ,so let me hit you with some skydiving 101.You're gonna want to pull the cord on the right to release your parachute at anywhere between 3000 and 2000 feet. If your chute got tangled, just kick your legs like crazy. You can also grab the chute and throw it away from your body. And if that doesn't work, cut the lose and pull the preserve cord. 

Rigby: What if that chute doesn't work?

Johnny: You've got the rest of your life to enjoy the view.

Rigby: Oh! oh.

Johnny: Don't worry, you'll do fine.

Rigby: Wait! You're not jumping with me?

Johnny: No, man! Someone's got to fly the plane.

Rigby: Who's flying it now? (Rigby and Johnny notice that no one's flying the plane.)

Johnny: Oh, crud! 

(Johnny slides off of the screen as the plane starts losing control.)

Rigby: Whoa, ah! (the plane continues losing control) Whoa! Whoa! (slides off of the plane) Whah! Wah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-AH-Ah-ah! (Rigby opens his eyes and notices that he's skydiving down to the reunion hall.) Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha! HA-ha-ha!! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!!! WOOOO!!!! Heh! (Rigby takes the burrito out of his suit, and tries to get the camera, but then he finally grabs the camera. Rigby rips the top paper part of the burrito, spits it out, and then gets the picture taken of himself pretending to eat the burrito while skydiving. Then, the picture comes out of the camera, but then it fly's away.) Na! (Rigby tries takes another picture, and this time he puts the burrito under his arm, and takes the second picture out of the camera, without making it fly away.) HA! (Rigby looks at his picture of himself pretending to eat the burrito while skydiving.) Perfect! (Rigby let's go of the camera, making it fly away and puts the picture in his suit for safe keeping. Then after Rigby skydives through a cloud, he notices the roof of the Reunion Hall.)The Reunion Hall! More perfect! 

Mordecai: Dude, something is wrong with his chute.

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro.

Rigby: Go away!

Mordecai: Dude, he cut away his chute!

Rigby: No! What do I do? What do I do? Burrito! Don't let me down, buddy! Promise to save my life before I let go of you? OK! Betrayal! Ha, Ha, Yeah! No!

Muscle Man: I don't know, man, I think that was his last burrito.

Mordecai: Wait, he's waking up!

Rigby: Uhh...Huh? Did I make it?

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. You went right through the roof.

Muscle Man: And you're not even dead.

Rigby: Uhh...Heh, heh, ha, ha, YE-HEAH!! No way I'm gonna die before all you losers, check this out! IN YO FACE!!! You thought I couldn't do it, but I did- Ugh! What the? I don't even need to skydive! Just look how ugly everyone got!

Mordecai: Wait, dude, these people are just really old.

Pops: Guys, hello!

Mordecai: Pops? 

Rigby: What're you doing here? You weren't in our class.

Pops: Oh, of course not, silly. This is my class reunion. I meant to tell you my class president accidentally mailed my invitation to you.

Rigby: I guess I have time to get the slam dunk in the Olympics now.
(The episode begins with a depressed Mordecai trekking on the partly snowy ground. Mordecai sighs and drops on a pile of snow flashbacking his kiss with Margaret and the moment CJ runs out the door from the Christmas party)

Mordecai: Man, I hate mistletoe.

(The scene cuts to Mordecai at the coffeshop. The coffeshop door opens and CJ begins the enter)

Mordecai: Uhhh, Hey CJ. Thanks for coming.

(They both sit down)

Mordecai: It's great to see you. How's your week been going?

CJ: So you wanted to tell me something?

Mordecai: Oh uh right, one sec....(he pulls out some presents for her) I got you something.

(CJ takes a giant piece of candy shaped like a butt saying "SORRY I'M SUCH A BUTT" Mordecai hands her a tape)

Mordecai: And I made this mix tape.

(The title of the tape says " SORRY I'M SUCH A BUTT")

Mordecai: All of the songs are apologies.

CJ: I'll listen to them in the car.

(A short silence occurs)

Mordecai and CJ: Look I wanted to....

Mordecai: Augh! CJ, I'm really sorry! I don't know what happened.

CJ: You don't? (sounding sarcastic) Because I can refresh your memory.

Mordecai: No, no. I just mean it was crazy. It didn't mean anything, I swear. Margaret and I.. all that stuff is in the past. It was just.. it was midnight and we were under a mistletoe, I was bound by mistletoe rules. I think that's a real law in some countries. (He turns his head) Eileen, back me up on this.

(Eileen shakes her head and runs away, not wanting to get involved.)

CJ: Mordecai, what you did was really lame. It took me this whole week to start feeling like I could look at your face without wanting to break a chair over it.

Mordecai: Understandable. (while nodding his head)

CJ: But if your being honest about this mistletoe thing I mean, I missed you. I feel like I'm ready to forgive and forget.

Mordecai: Phew.

CJ: As long as you swear there's nothing going on with you and Margaret.

Mordecai: I swear, honest. I just want things to go back to how they were before.

CJ: Yeah, me too.

(They both reach out to hold hands. Just then, the song from Butt Dial is heard and a selfie of Mordecai and Margaret appeared on Mordecai's phone)

CJ: Margaret? (She turns dark and becomes angered) Oh in the past, huh?!

Mordecai: I thought it was.

CJ: Then why is she calling you?!

Mordecai: I don't know! Why is she calling me?

(Mordecai immediately picks up his phone to end the call and CJ throws the bouquet of flowers on the table)

CJ: NICE CUSTOM RINGTONE, YOU JERK!! (She runs out the door)

Mordecai: CJ, WAIT!

(Mordecai is again seen depressed and sighed, he heard some saxophone music and saw a man on a bridge playing his saxophone with the moon in the background. He notices Mordecai.)

Sad Sad Guy: Oh hey, Mordecai. I haven't seen you in a couple of days, how're you doin'?

Mordecai: Hey Sad Sax Guy, what are you doing here?

(He jumps off the bridge and lands near Mordecai while playing some dramatic saxophone music)

Sad Sax Guy: I go whenever I needed. Let me guess, girl problems?

Mordecai: Actually yeah, how'd you know?

Sad Sax Guy: Brother, they don't call me Sad Sax Guy just because I play the sax and cry a lot. I know a broken heart when I see one, you tell me all about it and let's see if we could get this mess sorted out.

Mordecai: Well, I was at this party and...

Sad Sax Guy: Aaahh... mistletoe incident. Say no more, bro, I know all about it. I'll tell you what? Because I'm a man of romance, I'm gonna get you two back together.

Mordecai: You are? How?

Sad Sax Guy: I know a guy. He'll hook you up.

(He hands him a card in his sax saying "Bowler Hat Singing Apology Gram" with the number. Cut to CJ's apartment. CJ is reading a book when she hears the doorbell. She goes to answer, and the bowler hat guy is there.)

Telegram Guy: (singing) Ohhh, here's a singing telegram, apology and song. Mordecai was quite a jerk, he knows he did you wrong. But let's be fair, he....

(CJ stops him, unamused.)

CJ: Ok, ok. Hold on a sec. Do you know what he actually did to me?

Telegram Guy: Well, they don't give us that information, ma'am.

(Mordecai is watching the conversation from a bush. CJ leaves and the telegram guy looks at Mordecai. The two approach each other.)

Mordecai: So, did it work?

(The telegram guy slaps Mordecai in the face.)

Telegram Guy: You disgust me.

(He walks off, beginning to sing. Cut to Mordecai and Sad Sax Guy at the Snack Bar in the Park.)

Sad Sax Guy: Oh it is worse than I thought. That guys successfully apologized for arson. (picks up a hot dog from the trash) This is a tough one. No worries, though brother, lucky for you, I'm full of brilliant ideas. 

Mordecai: So, what should I do next?

Sad Sax Guy: Well, if I know women, and, lets be honest, I do. There's one thing women love more than anything else. Embarrassing elaborate public displays of affection. Here's the plan. 

(Scene transitions to a grocery store where CJ is at and there are cheerleaders with Mordecai performing cheerleading tasks. Mordecai falls over and CJ leaves the store annoyed as Mordecai is confronted by the cheerleaders. He asked the Sad Sax Guy for more advice. Scene then shows Mordecai and CJ running across the street and wave at each-other. CJ leaves angrily after Mordecai fakes his death by being hit by a bus. The bus driver toots his horn at Mordecai. Scene then transitions back to the park. Mordecai is walking through the park and Rigby tackles him.)

Rigby: Mordecai Stop! don't do it! 

Mordecai: Rigby, get off, what are you talking about?! 

Rigby: Don't act like you don't know. You've been talking to that Saxophone Guy again. Admit it! 

Mordecai: So what if I have. 

Rigby: Dude he gives the worst advice in the world. Remember when he gave you advice in art school because you were failing sculpture. 

(Flashback showing sad sax guy giving advice to Mordecai for an art sculpture)  

Sad Sax Guy: Pssh, that's it? Easy, make a sculpture of your instructor's human form.  

Mordecai: Yeah that didn't go so well. 

Rigby: You think? 

Mordecai: It will be different this time. He said he understands women.  

Rigby: He doesn't even understand how to put on a shirt! 

Mordecai: Whatever dude. Talk to me when your relationship advice is any better. 

Sad Sax Guy: Dang man I can't believe faking your death didn't work. Okay okay I got this. CJ is mad because you smooched another lady right? So just call up this other lady and get her to talk to CJ and clear the air.  

Mordecai: Get Margaret to talk to CJ? That sounds pretty risky. 

Sad Sax Guy: You don't get anywhere in life without risks brother and I take stupid risks all the time and look at me.  

(Scene transitions over to Mordecai and Margaret at a bench in the park.)  

Mordecai: Thanks for coming Margaret.   

Margaret: I'm just glad we can finally talk. I'm sorry for any trouble I caused you guys. But I don't think its a good idea for me to get involved.   

Mordecai: Yeah your probably right.   

Margaret: If its any constellation, I think CJ will come around/   

Mordecai: Thanks Margaret. Your a good friend.

CJ: (In the Car) Listen Mordecai maybe i shouldn't have broken that sign on your head and I guess the cheerleader thing was kind of clever.   

(CJ drives past the park and sees Mordecai and Margaret hugging and slams on the brakes.)   

CJ: (Toots her car horn  OH COME ON!   

Mordecai: Huh? CJ!  

(CJ gets angry and puts her foot on the accelerator and drives off)  

Mordecai: CJ, wait! I can explain! It was just a hug!  

Margaret: Sorry Mordecai. I better go before I somehow make things even worse. Good luck.  

Mordecai: Bye.  

Sad Sax Guy: Man bummer week huh? No offence but your game could use some serious tweaks brother.   

Mordecai: ( Grabs Sad Sax Guy) YOU, THIS IS  ALL YOUR FAULT!  

Sax Sax Guy: What did I do?   

Mordecai: I never should have listened to you! You don't know anything about art and you definitely don't know anything about women! I did everything you told me, and it just made everything 10 times worse!   

Sad Sax Guy: Ahh! It's true! I'm m a total fraud! I don't know nothing about nothing. (starts to cry) I just tell people what to do to try to feel like a big man. I don't even know how to play this thing except for one song! And I wouldn't even know that if my mom had forced me to go take a lesson! I'm a hot mess! Wait, of course. Mordecai. that's it. Your mom!   

Mordecai: Dude, are you calling my mom a hot mess?!  

Sad Sax Guy: What? No, no, I mean go ask your mom for advice, brother. They know everything! Especially when it comes to women.   

Mordecai: (Puts his arm on Sad Sax Guy's shoulder) Dude, that's the only good advice you ever gave me.   

(Scene changes to his parents house with his mom riding on an indoor fitness bike).     

Hilary: You got yourself on a hornet's nest on this one Mord. I'll let you in on a family secret. Your dad and I have been married for a long time now. And I attributed our success to one rule. 

Mordecai: No lies?

Hilary: That's the one. A good honest conversation can solve any problem. No texting, no emails, just the truth face to face. 

Mordecai: But she won't answer my phone calls. Let alone look at me in the face. 

Hilary: Just have to get her attention first. Then just follow my other rule. Go big or go home or make some food in the shape of her face. 

Mordecai: Thanks mom. Huh your super sweaty. 

(Scene changes to where Mordecai is peaking through the window of CJ's apartment watching TV with Rigby and Eileen. Mordecai picks up a hammer and some Christmas lights.) 

Mordecai: Time to go big or go home ( then goes up a scissor lift)

Construction Workers: Lets hurry boys. We still have six nativity machines to take down tonight. Hey that guys messing with the scissor lift. HEY STOP THAT WE JUST TOOK ALL THAT STUFF DOWN. Quit screwing up our prover margins bro. 

Another Construction Worker: Yeah come down with those lights so we can punch yours out. 

Construction Worker: Nice threat dude. 

Another Construction Worker: Thanks, It's kind of my thing 

Mordecai: I'm sorry I gotta do this to get my girlfriend to talk to me. 

Another Construction Worker: Nobody cares bro get off the lift and take your beating

Construction Worker: Yeah didn't you see the truck? The party's over we don't get paid until we take all of these lights down. 

Mordecai: The party's not over. 

(The Construction Workers shake the scissor lift)

CJ: What's going on out there?

Rigby: I don't know. 

Rigby: What the heck is he doing? (Finishes his pizza, and Eileen comes over)

Eileen: Rigby, you're missing the part where the Dracula shows up. Woah.

(As Mordecai struggles he texts Rigby to tell CJ to look out the window and the Construction Workers continue to shake the lift and throw stuff at Mordecai. He falls off but manages to get hold of a rail.) 

Mordecai: Rigby, please!

Rigby: Ahh!!! (Tears off the curtain)

CJ: Rigby, what the heck, are you crazy?! Mordecai? 

Another Construction Worker: (Crying) It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. 

Construction Worker: (Crying) Me too 

(Mordecai and CJ look at each-other and Mordecai lets go of the scissor lift. The Construction Workers grab him and beat him up with Sad Sax Guy playing his Saxophone on the top of the roof. Mordecai wakes up in the hospital with him bandage wrapped everywhere and being unable to move. CJ is there at the hospital.) 

Mordecai: Uhh my head huh 

CJ: How you doing?

Mordecai: Never better I didn't think you were ever going to talk to me again. 

CJ: Yeah nice trick putting me down as your emergency contact.

Mordecai: Yes, I'm so smart

CJ: So look I am glad your ok but we need to clear the air. I have to know what's going on between you and Margaret. No more weirdness, no candy, no teddy bears. Be straight with me. 

Mordecai: Margaret and i. Margaret means a lot to me. I was in love with Margaret for a long time and when we broke up it hurt for just as long. Seeing her at the Christmas Party brought up a lot of stuff for me that I wasn't ready to deal with and i acted like an idiot. CJ I screwed up and I feel terrible for hurting you but Margaret and I are over now. I understand if you hate my guts but I hope you know that I don't want to be with anyone but you.

CJ: Thanks for being honest Mordecai. I think we can give this one more shot. 

(There is a small piece of mistletoe on the ceiling and CJ lifts up the hospital bed Mordecai is in and they both kiss and the Sad Sax Guy is seen watching them from the window and going down using the scissor lift.) 


(End of Sad Sax Episode) 
(Episode starts with a temple and a volcano behind it.)

Announcer: Thousands of years ago, in the most ancient of dojos, the most delicious sandwich in the world entered our realm.

(The sandwich flies out of the volcano and a man on a sidewalk catches it and eats it.)

Announcer: The only problem is if you eat it wrong... You'll die.

Man: Huh?

(The man explodes. Then the scene cuts to a shirtless man holding the sandwich.)

Announcer: Fortunately, men discovered the correct way to eat it.

(The man's pants get ripped into jean shorts and a mullet wig appears on his head.)

Announcer: With cut-off jean shorts and the proper haircut.

(The man holds the sandwich up, then the scene cuts to a montage of random guys with jean shorts and mullets eating the sandwich in different ways.)

Announcer: (Sings) Death Sandwich! Death Sandwich! If you don't eat it right, you're gonna DIE tonight! It's the Death Sandwi-i-i-i-i-i-ich!! 

Announcer: So come on down to "Death-Kwon-Do Pizza & Subs."

Man: (Points to the camera) And remember, eat it right or you'll die!

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other and run out the door; scene goes to "Death-Kwon-Do Pizza & Subs" in the Two Peaks Mall; Mordecai and Rigby run to the counter.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhh...

(Sensai turns around, wearing an apron and is holding a notepad and pen.)

Sensai: How may I help you? (notices Mordecai and Rigby) You guys?!

Mordecai: Haha, hey.

Sensai: So, you have the nerve to look me in the eye after nearly destroying my Death-Kwon-Do business?!

Mordecai: Look, we're sorry about that, man. But hey, it looks like you really bounced back. Got this whole sandwich gig going on, looking good.

Sensai: (Sighs) You're lucky forgiveness is one of the many virtues of Death-Kwon-Do. So what can I get you?

Mordecai and Rigby: The Death Sandwich!

Sensai: To receive the Death Sandwich, you must first sign this waiver of death.

Mordecai: Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

Rigby: Why not?

(Sensai shows the waiver saying "You can't sue me" and they sign it.)

Sensai: Alright, I'll have that out for you in a minute.

(The Sensai backflips to behind a table and makes the Death Sandwich and making noises at the same time; the Sensai puts his hands together and brings it to Mordecai and Rigby.)

Sensai: One Death Sandwich.

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

Sensai: But, remember. If you don't eat it right, you die.

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah. Wear mullets and jean shorts. We got it.

(Mordecai grabs the sandwich; scene goes to them walking into the kitchen.)

Rigby: Man, I'm about to tear this thing up!

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh as they open it.)

Mordecai: Whoa, wait. We gotta get mullets and cut-offs first.

Rigby: Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now you're talking lunch!

Mordecai and Rigby: Death Sandwich! Death Sandwich! Death Sandwich!

(Mordecai and Rigby leave the sandwich on the table and walkout of the kitchen; Benson walks in, whistling and sees the sandwich on the table.)

Benson: Well, well, well. Looks like it's time for a little payback. Let's see how they like it when somebody else steals their sandwich.

(Benson takes a bite of the sandwich. Mordecai and Rigby enter the kitchen wearing mullets and cut-off jean shorts.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Death Sandwich! Death Sandwich!

Rigby: Aw, what?

Mordecai: Benson!

(Benson coughs. He has turned green in the face and is choking and gagging.)

Mordecai: Whoa, are you alright?

Rigby: It really is a death sandwich.

Benson: Death sandwich? Why would you buy something that kills people?

Rigby: Why would you eat somebody's sandwich!?

Mordecai: Come on, guys. This is serious. We gotta get Benson a cure from the Death Sandwich before it's too late.

(The scene transitions back to the Death-Kwon-Do Pizza & Subs.)

Mordecai: Dude, you gotta help us. Our boss ate the Death Sandwich wrong.

Sensai: What? How could this have happened?

Rigby: We left it in the kitchen, and Benson came and ate it.

Sensai: (Groans) It is clearly stated in the waiver that the Sandwich should never be left unaccompanied under any circumstances!

Benson: You didn't read the waiver?

Sensai: Now, if you would excuse me, I have a business to conduct. Good day, gentlemen.

Rigby: But our boss is gonna die!

Benson: If the Sandwich is so dangerous, then why don't you just take me to the hospital?

Mordecai: Yeah, you're probably right. Let's get outta here.

Sensai: (Groans) I'm afraid that would be a fatal mistake. (They all stop, then turn around.) Your boss is now far beyond the help of Western medicine.

Rigby: Well, then, what are we supposed to do?

Sensai: His only chance of survival now is to see my Sensei, the Grand Master of Death-Kwon-Do. He is the protector of the Sandwich of Life.

Rigby: What's the Sandwich of Life?

Sensai: It is the only known cure for the Death Sandwich. He will listen to your request, and if he agrees, he will let Benson have a taste. One bite from the sandwich will cure him instantly.

Mordecai: All right, let's do this. What's his address?

Sensai: I'm afraid it is not that simple. No mere outsider is allowed before the Sensei. I must accompany you on your journey. But time is of the essence. If your boss does not take a bite from the Sandwich of Life within six hours, he will die.

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson have a disturbed look on their faces. Sensai flips the sign around to say, "Be back in 5 minutes of death." He then drives off. In the car, Benson is choking and gagging.)

Mordecai: What's gonna happen to him if we can't get the Sandwich of life in six hours?

Sensai: His body will undergo six stages of agony while speeding towards his inevitable death. His face will turn green and he'll begin to choke.

Rigby: That's what was happening to him in the kitchen!

Sensai: Yes. Soon after, his face will start to burn.

Benson: Oww! It burns!

Sensai: Benson's intestines will begin to melt and leak out of his body. (Rigby scoots away from Benson.) He will shriek in pain, but no one will hear it, because his vocal chords will have long since evaporated. But then he'll regain his vocal chords...

Mordecai: Oh.

Sensai: ...Only to cry out for mercy in ancient dialects long since forgotten.

Benson: I'm pretty sure you can go 65 here.

(Finally, the car stops at a temple nestled in the mountainside.)

Sensai: I'm gonna go request a meeting with the Sensei. You guys just wait here.

(He exits the car. He approaches the guards at the temple gates, but one of them punches him, knocking him down.)

Sensai: Okay, minor setback. I forgot to mention that me and the Sensei kind of had a falling out. (He drives away.) It's time for Plan B.

Mordecai: What's Plan B?

Sensai: (Opens the trunk) We sneak in and take the sandwich by force. Here, Benson. You're gonna need the power of Death-Kwon-Do. (He tosses a pair of cut-off jeans to Benson.)

Benson: What, I just have to put these on?

Sensai: Not quite. (He pulls out a razor, and then turns it on.)

(Sensai and the three park workers all have cut-off pants on. They all leap over a wall.)

Sensai: The Sandwich of Life is at the very top of the mountain. Come now. We move as one!

(They all run for the entrance, but one of the guards spots them.)

Temple Guard: Hey, stop!

(The guard rings the warning bell.)

Sensai: Quickly! Into the first chamber!

(They enter the temple and find themselves in a room with a pit filled with rows upon rows of thick bamboo poles. Paintings of tigers and cranes are on the walls.)

Sensai: Things will become increasingly more difficult as we approach the sandwich. Be ready.

(On the other side of the pit, three guards enter the room, each carrying a bladed weapon. The middle one steps forward.)

Guard: (Attack yell) ...I mean Step of Dea-a-a-a-a-aa-ath! (He plummets to his doom.)

Sensai: That reminds me. In this room, you must say, "Step of Death" every time you step, or you will plummet to your death. Almost slipped my mind.

(The remaining two guards start hopping from pole to pole, saying...)

Guards: Step of Death! Step of Death! Step of Death!

Mordecai and Rigby: Step of Death!

Guard: Step of Death!

Mordecai and Rigby: Step of Death! (They use a Death Punch on the guard.)

Sensai and Benson: Step of Death! Step of Death! (The final Guard leaps in the air, swinging his weapon violently. Sensai and Benson dodge out of the way.)

Guard: Step of Death!

Sensai: (Does a Death Kick) Step of Death!

Rigby: (Does a Death Flip on another guard) Step of Death!

(Benson then Death Kicks the guard.)

Benson: (Weakly) Step of De-e-e-eath!

(Then a montage shows the group going through the next couple of chambers. The second one has a bunch of guards carrying sickles who jump out of the trees. The group defeats them. In the third chamber, a bunch of guards riding motorcycles crash through the windows. They circle the group, whirling their meteor hammers. But the group uses their own weapons against them. Just as the group approaches the next set of doors, clouds of mist appear out of nowhere. Guards wielding sais attack them, but to no avail. Inside the fourth chamber, two guards slam the ground with their powerful axes, knocking everyone backwards. Mordecai and Rigby do a Death Jump and take out both of them. In the fifth chamber is a guard with clawed hands and wearing a hockey mask. The guard crosses his arms and multiplies before the group. But the guard and his duplicates are no match for the group.)

(Finally, the group approaches the mountain summit. By this time, however, Benson has grown very weak, and is now pleading in ancient dialects long forgotten.)

Benson: (Weakly) Agga dagga dume tu kara tu...

Mordecai: We're almost to the top, Benson. Don't give up yet.

Sensai: The Sensei is through that door. (The door opens to reveal the Grand Sensei floating above the tip of the mountain's summit. Two sandwiches are next to him.)

Mordecai: Is that your Sensei?

Sensai: Yes. And that sandwich right there is the Sandwich of Life.

Rigby: Which one? There's two of them.

Sensai: It's the on the organic multi-grain. Opposite, we have the deadliest sandwich known to man: the Double Death Sandwich.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoooooaaa...

Sensai: Just let me address the Sensei. He might still be mad at me.

(They all approach the Sensei. Mordecai lays a weakened Benson down.)

Sensai: Sensei...

Sensai's Master: You got a lot of nerve coming back here after what you pulled.

Sensai: Forgive me, Sensei...

Rigby: What did you do? (Sensai groans.)

Sensai's Master: I took him off the streets and raised him like my own son. He repaid me by stealing the recipe for the Death Sandwich and mass-producing without permission!

Sensai: I will accept full responsibility for my crimes against the school. But there is now a more pressing matter at hand. Our friend Benson is about to die from eating the Death Sandwich incorrectly. We humbly request that you bestow the Sandwich of Life upon him.

Sensai's Master: (Laughs) You must be a real fool. Did you honestly think I'd just hand over the Sandwich of Life? Kill them!

(Several guards wielding katanas jump in the air and land in front of the group. Mordecai and Rigby jump and avoid their katanas, but get captured.)

Sensai's Master: You don't deserve the powers of Death-Kwon-Do!

(The Grand Sensei spins a razor in the air and hurls it forth. Sensai manages to escape the guards' clutches and jumps to the ground just as the razor shaves off some of his hair. Mordecai and Rigby scream in anger and Death Flip, knocking the guards backwards. Then the Grand Sensei laughs wickedly as his outfit comes off to reveal a pair of cut-offs and wristbands. He takes the two sticks from his hairdo and lets it slowly unfold. As Mordecai and Rigby stare at their foe and the Double Death Sandwich, Sensai looks on. The Grand Sensei then hurls the sticks at Mordecai and Rigby, but the duo dodges out of the way, and the sticks hit the doorway instead.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yaaa! (They start fighting the Grand Sensei. But the Grand Sensei has the upper hand and lands multiple blows while also blocking their attacks.)

Benson: (Weakly) Agga dagga... (Coughs) sanoubi...

Sensai's Master: (Laughs) He says that he forgives you. It's too bad he'll never taste from the Sandwich of Life. (He removes the cover from the Double Death Sandwich.)

Sensai: Sensei, no! Not the Double Death Sandwich!

Sensai's Master: Order up! (With an attack yell, he sends the Double Death Sandwich flying forward.)

(Sensai plays a few notes on his flute. He hands a small scrap of folded paper to a yellow bird, which hands it to Mordecai and Rigby. They unfold the sheet of paper and look at it.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Gasp) The Bicycle Kick of Death!

(The Double Death Sandwich gets much closer.)

Mordecai: Now!

(He and Rigby do the Bicycle Kick of Death, deflecting the Double Death Sandwich. The sandwich flies smack into the Grand Sensei's mouth, killing him. Rigby then removes the cover from the Sandwich of Life and tosses it to Sensai, who feeds it to Benson.)

Sensai: Come on...

(Benson is cured instantaneously, just as the mountain starts to rumble. A deep crevice suddenly appears on the ground.)

Rigby: What's happening?

Sensai: The mountain is self-destructing!

(The group falls through as the ground crumbles beneath them.)

Sensai: Use the Death Jump!

(The group uses a piece of crumbling earth as a boost and jumps out of the crevice. They all land safely in the car and start driving speedily as the mountain collapses behind them. Once they are safe, they all breathe a sigh of relief.)

Mordecai: Thanks so much. I don't know how we can ever repay you.

Sensai: I'll probably think of something.

(The scene transitions to the television. Mordecai and Rigby are on a commercial for the Death Sandwich.)

Announcer: So come on down to "Death-Kwon-Do Pizza & Subs" at the Two Pines Mall. And remember...

Mordecai and Rigby: (Point to the camera) Eat it right, or you die!

(Muscle Man and High-Five Ghost are watching the TV. They dash out the door.)

(End of Sandwich of Death)

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby lounging on the golf cart.)

Mordecai: Dude, what are we going to do this weekend? Nothing's going on.

Rigby: I don't know.

(Sound of the cart coming towards Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: (gasps) Dude, it's Benson.

(Mordecai and Rigby quickly gulp down the soda, throw the cans away, and clean the cart, as Muscle Man drops off Pops and Benson.)

Muscle Man: (reminding Benson) Alright, so that's tonight. Don't forget it.

Benson: We'll be there.

Muscle Man: See you there.

(Muscle Man drives away in the cart.)

Mordecai: What was that all about?

Rigby: I don't know.

Pops: Oh, Mordecai and Rigby. What costumes are you going to wear?

Mordecai and Rigby: Costumes?

Benson: Muscle Man's throwing a birthday party for Hi Five Ghost. Apparently, it's a costume birthday party.

Rigby: Let me see.

Mordecai: Ah, what? It's invite only.

Benson: You guys got invited, right?

Mordecai: We didn't even know there was a party. Did you know there was a party?

Rigby: No, I did not.

Mordecai: We didn't even know there was a party.

Benson: Oh, well... (snatching the invitation) Maybe you weren't invited.

(Mordecai and Rigby stared at each other. Scene cuts to Muscle Man putting a lot of cans of soda into an ice bucket.)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man. Uh... we heard that you're having a party tonight. What time should we show up?

Muscle Man: (dumping three cans of soda angrily) NEVER, YOU'RE NOT INVITED!

(Muscle Man then dumps the last few cans of soda into the ice bucket and drives away. Scene cuts to the House.)

Rigby: Ugh! Dude! What's his problem? Why won't he invite us to his party?

Mordecai: Dude. I know why he's not inviting us to the party.

Rigby: Why?

Mordecai: Remember when you were choking this morning.

(Scene cuts to that day's morning, Rigby is choking loudly in the kitchen.)

Muscle Man: (chuckling) Look at Rigby's face.

Mordecai: Oh no, he's choking! (walks over to Rigby) Don't worry, dude. I gotcha.

(Muscle Man continues laughing until Rigby throws up his spit wad, which then gets in his soda and splashes in his face.)

Muscle Man: (disgusted) Aw, sick! Your choke wad spat soda in my face! (whining hysterically)

(Scene cuts back to the present.)

Rigby: Dude, that wasn't our fault, I was gonna die. And besides, we got him a new soda.

(Scene cuts back to the morning as Muscle Man is still whining about the soda on his face.)

Rigby: Ugh, quit whining. Here's another soda, you big baby. (holds the glass of soda, but trips over the soda can, splashing more soda into Muscle Man's face) Uh oh...

(Muscle Man then goes into a ballistic frenzy, pushing the table against the wall, then whamming on it, and lying on the floor still whining. Scene then cuts back to the present again.)

Mordecai: Yep, that's probably why he's not inviting us to his party. We gotta go apologize.

(Scene cuts to M&R walking to Muscle Man's trailer. Rigby then knocks the door.)

Muscle Man: What?

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man. We're sorry about that soda thing this morning, so we bought our console as a peace offering. You can borrow it for your party.

Muscle Man: One, I don't know what you're talking about and B, I'm busy. But I'll still take your video game. (swipes the system from Mordecai and Rigby, then closes the trailer door) Yo, H.F.G.! I found a video game system on the ground. Let's see what happens when we put it in the microwave.

Rigby: Dude, you said that was gonna work.

Mordecai: (sighs) I know, I know.

Rigby: He'd better not trash our system. That thing wasn't cheap.

Mordecai: Come on!

(Scene cuts to later when M&R drive the cart and see Muscle Man prepare the decorations for the party.)

Rigby: Ugh! Man, he's not gonna invite us. We already said sorry. What else can we do?

Mordecai: (comes up with an idea) Oh, I know what to do.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: We just have to make Muscle Man think that we don't wanna go to his party.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Reverse psychology. If he thinks we're not into it, then he'll really want us to be there.

Rigby: Ohhhhh...nice.

Mordecai: Just act like the party's lame and watch the invitations come rolling in.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm! (Driving the cart over to Muscle Man as he is in the middle of the decoration preparation.)

Mordecai: Muscle Man, we don't wanna go to your party.

Muscle Man: Good, because I wasn't gonna invite you anyway, so get lost!

Mordecai: Muscle Man, we're sorry about the soda.

Muscle Man: What are you talking about?! I said GET LOST!!!

Mordecai: Ugh, forget it. (hits the gas pedal, spins the cart, and drives away.)

(Scene cuts to the House at nighttime. Mordecai and Rigby are lying on their beds.)

Rigby: (sighs) Wanna play some video games?

Mordecai: We gave away our system, remember?

Rigby: Well, whatever. The party's gonna be lame, anyway. It's just gonna Pops, Skips, and Benson sitting around doin' nothing.

(Mordecai and Rigby sit up as they hear thumping bass music from outside. Looking out the window they see what appears to be a rocking party taking place in a tent in the middle of the park.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoaaaa...

Mordecai: Dude, forget the invitation. Let's just crash it.

Rigby: Yeah.

(The scene cuts to outside the party. A bunch of unidentified guests are in costumes. Mordecai and Rigby show up wearing unconvincing cat and dog masks, respectively/)

Mordecai: Dude, this is amazing.

(They encounter a huge, muscle-bound bouncer, Bobby, at the tent entrance/)

Bobby: Hold up! You're not on the list.

Rigby: What? How do you know we're not on the list?

Bobby: Name?

Mordecai: Mordecai and Rigby.

Bobby: (checks list) Not on the list! I can only let people in that's on the list. (to another guest who walks past) Yo, hold up! You're not on the list.

(Muscle Man appears at the window.)

Muscle Man: Ey, yo, Bobby! You can let that guy in. He seems legit. Wooooo! Let's keep this party goin'!

Bobby: (to Bobby, showing him inside) Right this way, sir.

Mordecai: Aw, what? He didn't even have a costume.

Rigby: Yeah, what the H, Bobby?

Mordecai: Dude, let's go. (Mordecai walks away/)

Rigby: Wait, where you goin'?

Mordecai: We're gonna get into this lame party.

(Mordecai and Rigby appear around the back of the tent house, without their masks on.)

Mordecai: Dude, come on. We'll just go through the window. (Mordecai struggles to open the window. A ghost, looking exactly like Fives except with stubble, appears through the tent wall holding a soda can and wearing shades.)

Lo-Five Ghost: Hoo! Par-tay!

Rigby: Hey, it's fives!

Mordecai and Rigby: Happy birthday, fives!

Lo-Five Ghost: What?

Mordecai: Whoa, sorry. We thought you were someone else.

Lo-Five Ghost: (laughs) Dude, I'm not Hi Five Ghost, I'm his brother, Lo-Five Ghost. What're you guys doing out here? The party's inside! Woo!

Mordecai: Haha, yeah... we... weren't really invited.

Lo-Five Ghost: What? Why not?

Rigby: That's what we wanna know. We don't really care - we just wanna get in.

Lo-Five Ghost: OK, look. I'm not supposed to say this but, if you really wanna get into the party, I can turn you into a ghost.

Mordecai and Rigby: Really?

Lo-Five Ghost: Yeah, then you won't have to go through the door. You can go through the wall. Plus, your costumes will be a lot more believable. So, what do you say? You guys wanna do it?

Mordecai: Let's do it!

Rigby: OK, yeah!

Lo-Five Ghost: Ha ha! Alright! Up high, Down low...

(The two are transformed into ghosts by the power of hi- and lo-fiving.)

Lo-Five Ghost: ...Now you're ghosts.

Mordecai: Aw, man. This is so cool...

Rigby: Dude, dude, punch me in the face!

Mordecai: OK.

(Mordecai swings a punch at Rigby, who squeals in pain.)

Rigby: Nooooouuaaaoow! I thought stuff's supposed to go through us.

Lo-Five Ghost: Well, yeah, real stuff if you want, but not other ghosts. Woooooo! Party!

(We cut to inside. Pops is dressed like an ice cream cone, Benson like a vampire, and Hi Five Ghost is wearing an eyepatch.)

PPP: Mordecai and Rigby, hello!

Mordecai: Hey, happy birthday!

Rigby: Yeah, happy birthday!

Hi Five Ghost: Thanks!

Benson: So, you guys got invited after all?

Rigby: Hmm! Hmm!

Mordecai: Hmm! Hmm! You could say that.

Pops: What wonderful costumes!

Rigby: Ha! These aren't costumes.

Hi Five Ghost: Wait, those aren't costumes?

Mordecai: Yeah, no, we're totally ghosts.

Rigby: Yeah, your brother turned us into ghosts so we could sneak in here and wish you a happy birthday.

Hi Five Ghost: Oh no. This is bad.

Rigby: Yeah, we're bad. We do whatever it takes to party! (Rigby hi-fives Mordecai.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ha ha!

Hi Five Ghost: No, you've got bigger problems. If you don't get turned back into yourselves soon, you'll be stuck as ghosts forever.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Well change us back!

Hi Five Ghost: I can't. I don't know how.

(Cuts to across the room, where Hi Five Ghost angrily confronts his brother at a snack table.)

Hi Five Ghost: Dude! You turned them into ghosts?! Change them back!

Lo-Five Ghost: I don't know how to! But... maybe dad knows.

(Back in the middle of the party, they speak to Hi Five Ghost's Father.)

Hi Five Ghost's Father: Hmm. Not good. Not good at all. If you want to turn back into yourselves, you have to scare someone.

Mordecai: Scare someone?

Hi Five Ghost's Father: Yes. It's the only way.

Mordecai: Dude, let's scare Muscle Man. He doesn't know we're here yet, so he won't be expecting it.

Rigby: OK, let's do it!

(Muscle Man appears at the top of the stairs.)

Muscle Man: Oh, man! I gotta use it!

Mordecai: He's going to the bathroom. Quick, hide!

(They run into the bathroom and turn off the light. Muscle Man opens the door and turns on the light, at which point Mordecai and Rigby scream at him. Muscle Man yells in shock, and grabs his chest, falling to the ground.)

Rigby: What's he doing?

Mordecai: Oh no. He's having a heart attack!

(Mordecai and Rigby drag Muscle Man into the party room.)

Mordecai: We need a doctor!

Hi Five Ghost's Father: Everyone back up, back up! What happened?

Mordecai: We scared him... and he fell over!

Hi Five Ghost's Father: OK, step back, let him breath. (He checks his breath) He's not breathing! (He begins administering CPR) ... he's gone.

(The crowd gasps in horror as Hi Five Ghost's Father closes Muscle Man's eyes for the last time.)

Hi Five Ghost: Oooooooooaaaaugh! You killed my best friend!

Mordecai: We're sorry!

Rigby: Yeah, we didn't mean it!

Mordecai: We just wanted to get into the party.

(On the ground, Muscle Man's eyes open a tiny bit, before he speaks/)

Muscle Man: Got you, dudes. Ha ha ha ha! Best, Prank, Ever! (Muscle Man laughs and whoops.)

Mordecai: What?! What's wrong with you?!

Rigby: This was a prank?!

Muscle Man: (laughs) Yeah, it was! And you two fell for it!

Benson: Wait. I thought you invited us to a costume party.

Muscle Man: I did. But that was just the beginning of my plan.

(A flashback montage begins, narrated by Muscle Man, showing everything he describes.)

Muscle Man: When you jerks spilled soda in my face, I knew I had to get you back. That's when I decided to throw a party. I invited people and I made sure that you were aware of that. Then we bailed Fives' brother out of jail so he could turn you into ghosts.

(The montage ends.)

Muscle Man: It was the ultimate prank. The ultimate payback.

Mordecai: Wait... but if you wanted to prank us at the party, how come you didn't invite us?

Muscle Man: Easy: not inviting you was the only way I knew you'd show. It's called reverse psy-cho-logy, babies! (Muscle Man pronounces the ch- in psychology like the ch- in chew) Ha ha ha ha!

Mordecai and Rigby: Augh!

Rigby: This is the lamest and most expensive prank ever.

Muscle Man: Ha ha ha ha! And it was worth it. Maybe next time you'll think twice before spilling soda in my face.

Mordecai: Yeah, we'll definitely think twice.

Benson: Alright, I'm out of here.

(The guests all start to leave.)

Muscle Man: Ha ha ha ha! Where you guys goin'? Thee's still plenty of food! (Muscle Man begins to stuff his face with food and laughs) Ha ha ha ha!

(Muscle Man begins to choke.)

Rigby: Oh, dude, Muscle Man's choking! (To Hi Five Ghost's Father) You have to help him! You're a doctor!

Hi Five Ghost's Father: No, I'm not a doctor. That was just part of the prank. Does anyone know the Heimlich?

(The remaining guests look to each other helplessly.)

Rigby: Mordecai knows it.

Mordecai: Yeah, right, he's just faking it. As soon as I help him, he's going to be all (mimics Muscle Man's voice) Got you again, dudes. (Switches back to his normal voice) I'm sick of it.

Rigby: Ah, lame. Dude, are you pranking us?

(Muscle Man shakes his head as he continues to choke. He falls to his knees.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Dude, he's not pranking us!

Mordecai: I got you Muscle Man, I got ya!

(Mordecai performs the Heimlich and gets the food out of Muscle Man's throat.)

Mordecai: I hope this makes us even.

Muscle Man: It does. Lo-Fives, change 'em back.

(Lo-Five Ghost clicks his fingers and returns Mordecai and Rigby to their normal selves.)

Muscle Man: I'm sorry I pranked you guys so hard. Look. It's gonna be a real party, and you guys can stay if you want to.

(Muscle Man offers his hand, and Mordecai shakes it.)

Benson: So, seriously. Is this a real party or not?

Muscle Man: Does this answer your question?

(Muscle Man waves a cassette tape, then throws it towards the tape deck, but misses.)

Muscle Man: Aw.

Benson: No. Doesn't really answer my question.

Muscle Man: I thought I could get it in the tape deck. (Walks over to and picks up the tape). Here. Does this answer your question? Everybody, party! (The music starts and the guests all dance.)

Mordecai: Can you believe this?

Rigby: No. Hey, next time you see Muscle Man with a soda, can you remind me not to spill it in his face?

Mordecai: Yes. Yes I can.

(Muscle Man appears with an odd-looking video game system.)

Muscle Man: Hey guys. I thought you'd like to have this back.

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, thanks.

Mordecai: Hey, wait. Is this just paper mache?

Muscle Man: Yeah, sorry guys. I sold the real one to a pawn shop. It was all a part of the prank.

Mordecai: Are you serious?

Rigby: What's wrong with you?

(Muscle Man pulls the real console from behind his back.)

Muscle Man: Got ya, dudes. (The episode ends)

(The short begins with Benson checking the attendance for the Park employees.) 

Benson: (sighs) Where are Mordecai and Rigby?

(Benson's phone rings)

Benson: Hello?

Mordecai: (sniffs) Benson, Rigby and I are really sick.

Rigby: Yeah. 

(Rigby coughs all over Mordecai)

Mordecai: Aw gross, dude!

Benson: Oh, well there's no way you're coming to work.

Rigby: Oh no, Benson. It's okay, we can still -

(Rigby yacks up over the phone)

Benson: No, no. I insist. You two slide right into bed...

(Benson hangs up. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby, who have a waterslide set up)

Mordecai & Rigby: Sick day!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump onto their waterslide, go up a bump, under a tunnel they made, and around a tree, while laughing)

Mordecai: Any second now, dude!

(A pizza delivery man pulls up next to them)

Pizza Guy: Pre-paid pizza delivery for Mordecai and Rigby?

Rigby: That's us!

(Rigby takes the pizza, and the duo take a slice each)

Mordecai: Dude, this worked out perfectly -

(Unexpectedly, Mordecai and Rigby slide down a hill, and both scream, go through a loop, over some water, and up to some segway riders)

Mordecai: Look out!

(They crash through the riders, and pass an old lady on a mobility scooter, who hits them with her handbag)

Lady: Get away from me, you gabriens! 

(They enter a farm, go through a chicken coop, and then a horse coop, before sliding into the city. A thief can be seen running off with a woman's handbag)

Woman: Stop, thief!

(Mordecai and Rigby knock the thief over and catch the handbag, and pass it back to the woman he stole it from)

Woman: Thank you so much!

(The mayor runs passed them with a giant key)

Mayor: Good jobs, boys! I'm the mayor! Here's the key to the city!

(Mordecai holds the key, but the slide brings them into a modern art gallery. They enter a sculpture garden, go through a billboard, and into a candy factory, they then go straight back into the Park, but break through a water tower, which then collapses, flooding the waterslide all the way back to the House.)

Benson: A-ha! I saw you setting up that slide three weeks ago, so I changed it last night! Still wanna call this a sick day?

(Mordecai and Rigby groan)

Mordecai & Rigby: Totally.

(The duo high five, ending the short "Sick Day".)

(Episode opens at Pops's House. Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are at the steps. Mordecai and Rigby are linked on a video game. Skips walks by with a wheelbarrow.)

Skips: So, who's up for cards at my house tonight?

Muscle Man: (holds up four tickets) Can't. Me and Fives are taking our ladies to see some Mexican wrestling.

Hi Five Ghost: Mucho romantico.

Benson: Audrey and I are going to a jazz concert.

Rigby: I got plans with Eileen.

Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost: Oooooooooooooooh!

Rigby: Friend plans. She wants to show me her new rock polisher.

Muscle Man: You know who else likes to polish people's rocks?

(Mordecai and Rigby glare at him, while Benson and Skips just stare in disbelief. All four can understand what Muscle Man said was an innuendo.)

Skips: Mordecai?

Mordecai: Aw, I would, but CJ and I are going to a laser light show tonight. But you can totally come with us.

Skips: Ah, no. That's okay. I've, uhhh, I got some other guys coming over. In fact, I better get going. Uh, have fun, everyone. (He walks off. Everyone says their goodbyes to him.)

All: All right. See ya. (etc.)

(Cut to Skips's House. Skips comes in, turns on the light and goes to his table, where he has food and a stack of cards set up. He sighs and puts the food away, straightens things up, and goes to lit some weights. He plays cards by himself, then goes to the fridge and takes sardines. Skips is seen watching TV and eating.)

Man (on TV): Baby, I don't know where I'd be today if I hadn't met you.

Woman (on TV):' 'Probably home alone watching a romantic comedy in the dark.

(Both laugh. Skips groans. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby walking along.)

Rigby: How was the laser show? (He elbows Mordecai.) Did you put your arm around CJ?

Mordecai: Did you put your arm around Eileen's rock polisher?

Rigby: Stop talking!

Mordecai: (stops Rigby) Wait. Skips?

(Skips is sitting on a stool outside.)

Rigby: You okay, man?

Skips: Yeah. (Then he corrects himself.) No! I've been skipping solo for too long now. I need to start dating again.

Rigby: Skips! Gettin' back in the saddle!

Skips: I guess. It's been so long, I don't even know where to start.

Rigby: Aw, it can't be that bad. How long's it been?

Skips: 200 years.

Mordecai and Rigby: Wooooaaaaaaahhh!

Mordecai: Well, better now than never. You just gotta get out there.

Rigby: What you need are some wingmen.

Skips: Wingmen?

Rigby: You know, your co-pilots. Your bros. The one's who got your back while you're looking for ladies.

Skips: Hmm. (cut to him picking up his phone and dialing a number) It's me. Uh, I need some wingmen.

Gary:  I've been waiting 200 years to hear you say that.

(Cut to a club called Shark Tank. People are hanging out. We see Skips, Gary, Techmo and Reginald at a table.)

Skips: So, uh, what happens now? Do we just sit here and wait till they come talk to us?

Gary: Waiting doesn't get you the ladies, Skips.

Techmo: Watch and learn.

(We see two ladies seated at a table. Gary and Techmo walk over to them.)

Gary: Excuse me, ladies. Perhaps you could settle a bet. Which one of us do you think is older?

Lady #1: I dunno.

Gary: Neither. We're both immortal. (He snaps his fingers. The ladies disappear and reappear next to Gary and Techmo, respectively.) Plus, we're magic.

(The ladies laugh as they walk off with Gary and Techmo.)

Reginald: Ooh, check it out.

(Two ladies are widely smiling at Reginald and Skips.) Fly honies giving us eye contact. (They go to the ladies.)

Reginald (continued): Excuse me. Are you a parking ticket? Cause you've got "fine" written all over you.

(They laugh.)

Lady #2: We are fine.

Reginald: Hey, that's a nice outfit you have on there. (bumps Skips)

Skips: Uh, yeah. (stammers) I like it a lot.

Lady #3: What do you like about it?

Skips: Oh, uh, it looks comfortable, uh, like uhh....(sees Reginald's "diaper") Like my friend's diaper!

Lady #3: My dress looks like a diaper?! (Reginald glares at Skips) He just said I'm wearing a diaper! (smashes plate)

(Cut back to Skips's house, where Mordecai and Rigby are laughing and throwing cards into a trashcan. Gary's car magically appears to drop Skips off.)

Gary: We'll try again next week, Skips. (to the ladies) Who wants to see a supernova?

(The ladies laugh again. Reginald sticks his heard through the window.)

Reginald: And, by the way, it's not a diaper! (Gary drives off) They're adult diapers! There's a differeeeeeeeence!

(Skips sighs and goes to Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: Hey, Skips.

Rigby: Meet any fine females tonight?

Skips: I'm just not cut out for the whole club scene.

Rigby: Dude, nobody meets anybody at clubs anymore.

Mordecai: Yeah. There's an option for people like you who make terrible first impressions.

Both: The internet!

(Cut to computer room. Mordecai and Rigby are setting up an online dating profile for Skips.)

Mordecai: Alright. We gotta fill in your profile. Profession?

Skips: Park Groundskeeper.

Mordecai: Uh-uh-uh. (airquotes) Enviromental Technologist.

Rigby: (typing) Hobbies?

Skips: I'm good at fixing stuff.

Rigby: Mechanical wiz who can fix anything: busted engines, broken hearts, whatever you got.

Mordecai: You've travelled all over the world. Girls like a guy who's cultured.

Rigby: Fought monsters with a ninja sword, arm wrestled Death, and also you love kittens to show your softer side. And done! (clicks and completes the profile "Skipster")

Skips: Now, what do we do?

Mordecai: Sit back and let the ladies come to you.

Skips: How long's it gonna take?

Mordecai: I dunno. It could be a while.

(Computer beeps)

Rigby: Whoa, look at that! You've already got 85,000 views!

Mordecai: Dude, you're on the front page of the website! "Based on your top-rated profile, you've been selected to be a contestant on the hit dating show It's a Date!"

Skips: What?

Mordecai: Aw, man. You'll meet someone now for sure!

Rigby: Up high! (raises his hand)

Skips: I can't go on a dating show. I'm not that kind of guy.

Rigby: Would you rather be the kind of guy who spends the next 200 years shuffling his cards?

(Skips is at loss for words. We are then shown Two Peaks Mall. Mordecai, Rigby and Skips enter a shop called Player Station, where Skips tries on a suit and new shoes. The guys are impressed. They go to another place in the mall called Spray Crazy, where Skips gets a spray tan. We are shown Cheap Cuts, where Skips gets a haircut. When it's finished, Mordecai and Rigby are happy with his new look. Cut back to Skips's house, where he is looking himself in the mirror.)

Mordecai: Looking good, Skips!

Skips: I don't know. These pants are a little tight.

Rigby: You wanna look cool, right!

Skips: (sighs) Yes.

Mordecai: It's getting late. We gotta get you prepped for the questions on the show tonight.

Skips: What questions?

Rigby: Dude, the ladies ask you questions and you impress them with your slick responses.

Mordecai: (takes out cards) Here, let's run through a practice round. "If you were trapped on a desert island with just one thing, what would it be?"

Rigby: Boom! Go!

Skips: That's easy. Fresh water.

Rigby: (sounds like a buzzer) Wrong! You gotta say something cool like, "All I need is your deep blue eyes to look into," Cheese it up! Make em laugh! It's not hard.

Skips: How do you know?

Rigby: Cause I've seen every episode of It's a Date! (silence) What? I've had a lotta spare time since Mordecai started dating CJ.

Skips: If you're so good at this, why don't you do it?!

Rigby: I would if I could!

Skips: Oh, so you adimt that you can't?!

Rigby: No! It's just that I don't have the right look or whatever, which has nothing to do with me being cool with my words.

Skips: Well, I'm not a word guy, okay?!

Mordecai: Hmm-hmm-hmm. I got an idea.

(Scene cuts to 'It's a Date!')

Announcer: Welcome to It's a Date! Let's give it up for your host, Bob Karpett! 

(Bob walks on stage as the live audience cheers.)

Bob: Thank you, thank you! Let's give a warm welcome to our bachelorette, Sheena Albright! (Sheena walks on stage) Sheena is a molecular biologist who loves tennis, Italian cuisine, and sloths. (Audience cheers) Now it's time to meet our 3 eligible bachelors! (We are show 3 shadows) Bachelor number one is a hip-hop enthusiast. (Shadow reveals a guy with a body of a horse) Please welcome Jimmy Jamzz! 

Jimmy: Yo yo yo! What's peepin', Sheena?

Sheena: (giggles) Yo!

Bob: Bachelor number two runs his own T-shirt business. (Shadow reveals a guy wearing and holding a t-shirt) Say hello to the T-Shirt Man!

T-Shirt Man: Buy my t-shirts!

Bob: And, bachelor number three is a ventriloquist. (Shadow reveals Skips with Rigby as a ventriloquist) Say hello to Skips and his dummy, Lil' Rigs!

Rigby: Hey hey, what's shaking, dogface? Hold on tight, strap yourself in, cause a date with me will make your head spin!

(Sheena laughs with the audience as Skips smiles.)

Bob: Alright, Sheena. It's time for your first question for our bachelors.

Sheena: If we went out on a date, where would you take me? Bachelor #1.

Jimmy: Girl, I'd take you to the hoppinest dance club in town. 'Cause Jimmy Jamzz is all about bustin' killer moves, girl! (belly rolls) Aw yeah. dawg!

Sheena: Okay. Bachelor #2.

T-Shirt Man: I would take you to a fine dining establishment and then show you my latest line a t-shirts! (takes off shirt revealing one with a heart and whoops)

Sheena: Hmmm. Bachelor #3?

Skips: Uh, go out for a nice meal?

Rigby: And go to the planetarium! Cause you surely belong with all the other heavenly bodies.

(Audience oooohs while Sheena blushes and giggles.)

Sheena: Next question. What is your biggest dream in life? Bachelor #1.

Jimmy: Pssh. Girl, I'm already living my dream! I've been regional hip-hop dance champion 9 time in a row, player! Shout out to my Four Legger Crew! (crew dances)

Sheena: Bachelor #2?

T-Shirt Man: My dream is to sell my t-shirts in all stores nationwide. That and move out of my momma's basement.

Sheena: Ehh. Bachelor #3.

Skips: Well, uh, save up for retirement.

Rigby: Geez, Gramps! You're not dead yet! But judging by you stage presence, you might as well be! Hey yo! (Audience laughs while Skips is not amused) But seriously, Sheena. My only dream is to make each day with you better than the last.

Audience: Awww!

Sheena: Uh, why thank you, Bachelor #3.

T-Shirt Man: Aw, come on! That's the worst pickup line I ever heard!

Rigby: The only thing you should pick up is a pair of scissors and cut off that lame mullet! 

(Audience laugh while T-Shirt man feels his hair.)

Skips: Rigby!

Rigby: Hey, the audience loves me. Wish I could say the same for these two dummies.

T-Shirt Man: You callin' me a dummy, dummy?

Rigby: No, but you know who is calling you is your mom! She wants you ringcheck, fool!

T-Shirt Man: I've had enough of your lip, son! Playtime's over! (He rips off his heart shirt revealing a fist shirt, then takes a gun setting it from "Stadium Event" to "Kill Some Fool". He starts shooting T-shirt bullets at Skips but he carries Rigby out of harm's way.)

Jimmy: (starts hip-hop dancing) I just cen-tore it up! (starts crashing the set, causing Sheena to scream)

T-Shirt Man: Eat t-shirt! (shoots more t-shirts around the set)

Four Legged Crew Member #1: Let's teach this punk some manners! (gets shot by a t-shirt)

(The T-Shirt Man shoot a stagelight. The audience and Bob scream as it's about to fall on him. Skips grabs the stagelight and throws it aside. He moves Jimmy out of the way of a stage wall. He see T-Shirt Man.)

Skips: That's enough! (grabs gun and punches him.)

Mordecai: Look out!

(Skips notices the stage pillars falling on each other, and one is about to fall on a screaming Sheena, when he holds it up, causing his suit it rip off, stunning her. He throws the pillar aside.)

Skips: You okay? (He lifts Sheena and grabs a mic.) Look everyone I'm not a ventriloquist. (Audience gasps. He points to Rigby.) And this isn't a dummy, (Audience gasps again.) The truth is, I'm just a simple guy who works at a park, a quiet guy who want meet a nice girl. Someone I can spend time with and talk to, and, uh,  doesn't mind that I like to go commando. (Man signals gasp sign. Audience gasps) Anyway, I'm sorry I wasted everybody's time. (drops mic and leaves)

Sheena: Wait! I choose Bachelor #3!

Skips: Huh?

Bob: (picks up mic) It's a date! (Sheena runs up to Skips as the audience cheers. T-Shirt Man reveals a sad face shirt) Sheena and Skips, you two win an all-expenses-paid trip to Costa Rica!

(The audience, including Mordecai and Rigby, continues to cheer as Sheena and Skips smile at each other. We cut to Pop's house sometime later, where Mordecai and Rigby are waiting. A taxi drives up, and Skips comes out.)

Skips: Keep the change! (taxi drives off)

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips! Skips! Skips!

Rigby: How was Costa Rica with your chicka?!

Skips: Well, uhhh. (we are shown various scenes from Skips' trips) Ah, she was too high-maintenance. But I'm back in the saddle. Thanks, guys.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoooooooaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Mordecai: Nice, nice. 

(End of Skips in the Saddle)

(Scene opens with Skips working on the cart in his garage.)

Skips: (sighs after sipping a cup of tea)

Mordecai: Hey Skips, could you help us fix the pump in the fountain?

Skips: I'm kinda busy here.

Rigby: (whining) But Skips, we don't know what we're doing!

Skips: (sighs) Alright, I'll be right there. (skips out of his garage. Scene cuts to him fixing the fountain for Mordecai and Rigby. Benson walks to them carrying paint)

Benson: Skips, can you help me put a new can of paint on the benches?

Skips: (Sighs as he touches his arm) Yeah, sure. (walks off to do so. Cut to Skips painting the benches)

Pops : Skips, can you help me plant my chrysanthemums?

(Skips sighs and then clutches in pain as he notices some black lines)

Pops: Skips?

Skips: Sure, sure, Pops.

(Cut to Skips planting. Benson runs over to him)

Benson: Skips, what's going on with those benches?

Skips: I had to help-

(Muscle Man shows up with Hi Five Ghost.)

Muscle Man: Skips, we wrecked another gas line.

Skips: Uhh...

Mordecai & Rigby: Skips! Skips! Skips!

Skips: What? What? What?

Mordecai & Rigby: Lunch. Lunch. Lunch.

Skips: Why don't you guys go on ahead without me? I've got too much to do today.

Mordecai: Come on dude. You look like you could use some lunch.

(cut to Two Peaks Mall. Everyone is having lunch.)

Msucle Man: Ok, ok. How much money would it take for you to walk up to a shark and punch it in the face? Go!

Mordecai: (thinking) I'd do it for half a million. But only if I get to pick the shark.

Rigby: I'd do it for $500 and get me a pair of genuine leather biker boots! What about you, Skips?

Skips: Look, I don't know, guys. Can we just get back to the park? I got a lot to do today!

Rigby: Oh, oh! I got one.

(Skips groans in pain again. Cut to everyone leaving)

Benson: You should get a motorcycle before you get biker boots.

Rigby: Yeah, I'm gonna listen to the guy who doesn't drive a hog to work every day.

Muscle Man: Hey! Everybody stop leaving and come look at this! (Skips sighs) A stress test machine. I always ace these things. (places his hand on the machine) You know who else always aces these things? MY MOM! (starts the test by pressing the red button. It gives the final results)

Stress Machine: Stress Level: Moderate. Suggestion: Cut back on the late night pies.

Muscle Man: Aw, what?

All: (except Skips): Whoa!

Rigby: You should do it, Skips. You'd be all, (imitates Skips) 'Stress? Never heard of it!'

Skips: Aaah, can we just go? (Everyone encourages him to do it) Fine! If it'll get us outta here quicker, I'll do it! (sits down and starts the test by pressing the red button and then placing his hand)

Stress Machine: (beeping) Stress Level: Critical.

(The pharmacist is alerted by this just at the pharmacy.)

Pharmacist: (comes out of the pharmacy and takes the incoming stress test results out of the machine) Oh my goodness. Oh, oh no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Sir, are these your stress test results?

Skips: Uh, yeah. Why?

Pharmacist: (shows him his stress levels) I regret to inform you that your stress levels are off the charts.

Mordecai: Whoa! How did that even happen?

Rigby: Yeah, Skips, what made you so stressed?

Skips: Look, I'm fine! Can we just go?

Pharmacist: No, I'm afraid you're not fine. Now, uh, may I? (takes Skips arm and reveal the black lines on it. Everyone is surprised at the sight of it) These are indicators of severe stress.

Skips: I guess I have been a little stressed out.

Pharmacist: Sir, if you fail to reduce your stress level, you will die.

Pops: But he's immortal!

Pharmacist: Who's the pharmacist here? The immortality won't save him on this one! (to Skips) I'm sorry, sir, but if you don't take immediate action to reduce your stress levels, you will die. (Skips is now feeling uncomfortable) Now, can I interest you in any bandages or bread strips?

(Scene cuts to Skips and Benson walking to Skips's House)

Benson: I'm worried about you, Skips. I think you should take the rest of the day off.

Skips: I can't. I've got too much to do today!

Benson: No, Skips. You're taking the day off. Doctor's orders.

Skips: Fine. (goes into his house and lies down. He enters a dream.)

Rigby: (on a unicycle) Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips!

Mordecai: Skips, you gotta help us. Quick, put this on! (he and Rigby put a black and white shirt on Skips. The dark background reveals a haunted house carnival.)

Benson: (in a ringmaster costume) Skips! (Skips turns arounds and sees him.) Skips, I've got to start my show! Where's my fish?! Where's my fish?! (his hands turn into black octupus-like whips. A shark swallows him.)

(Skips hears Pops laughing at a booth.)

Pops: Skips, you must play at my booth! (Voice deepens as he turns into a black creature) Try to hit the target! (laughs)

(Skips begins to back away.)

Muscle Man: Skips! Test your strength, bro! (his hair becomes dark and wiggly) Ring the bell, Skips! Ring the bell!

(Skips notices a mallet in his hands, then see a bell in front of him. He bangs the mallet down and rings the bell. The black lines on the shirt wriggle around.)

Skips: Aaaah!

(He wakes up from the dream and finds something shocking underneath the blanket. Scene cuts to Pops's House. Everyone and Skips, who is wearing a jacket, is waiting for Benson.)

Benson: Alright, guys. Here's what left to do today. (notices Skips) Skips, what are you doing here?

Skips: I'm working.

Benson: No, you're not. The doctor said you need to take it easy.

Skips: He was a pharmacist at a shopping mall! Trust me, I'm fine.

Benson: You sure?

Skips: Yeah. I'm fine!

Benson: Alright, but let me know if it's too much. (checks the schedule) Okay. So, we have the ice cream social today. Skips, you're setting up the booth, the ice cream--

(Skips starts screaming in pain and rolls downs the stairs as everyone looks at him in shock. He knocks himself out cold. Screen fades out and we see his friends surrounding him. Fades out again and Benson unzips his jacket. Fades out again and we see the stress lines again. Fades out again and we see the stress leading through his heart. Screen fades for a short time.)

Rigby: Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips!

(When he comes to, Pops has just taken something off his head.)

Mordecai: Skips, are you alright?

Rigby: Yeah, what's that black gunk?! You look like you're gonna die! (Mordecai punches him) Oww!

(Benson and Pops are both helping Skips.)

Skips: It's just stress. I-I-I'm okay.

Pops: Skips, you're not okay! You can't put it off any longer. You must visit the bell!

Mordecai: Bell? What bell?

(Pops and Benson help Skips up while he winces in pain.)

Pops: There is an ancient stress bell that lies atop the Himalayan mountains. When it is rung, it relieves you of all your stress.

Benson: Then why didn't you visit the bell sooner?

Skips: It's not that simple. Ringing the bell is 5 times more dangerous than stress itself. Usually I can keep my stress under control, but I guess I let it get out of hand.

Rigby: Well, okay. You gotta ring this bell. But how do we get to the Himalayas?

Pops: Leave it to me.

(Cut to Pops opening his garage, where Carmenita is. He takes her out of the garage and opens the boot. Skips places a sword in the boot. Rigby asks, "Is that a ninja sword?" and Skips nods "Yes". Pops puts Carmenita in fly mode and he, Skips, Mordecai, Rigby and Benson start taking off to the Himalayas. Muscle Man and Fives wave goodbye to them, and they wave back. As they are flying, Skips' stress continues to envelope him. Rigby shows a mixtape entitled "Rigby's Stress Mix". He plays it, and Skips covers his ears. Mordecai slaps him, and throws the mixtape out of the car. A storm brews, and Skips stress become even worse. Benson places a watch in Skips mouth so he can calm down. The guys have arrived at the Himalayan mountains.)

Skips: There it is. The ancient stress bell.

(We are shown a giant bell. Benson hops out of the car.)

Benson: Here, Skips. We'll help you up there.

(Everyone starts carrying Skips to the bell. They walk past a bunch of skeletons.)

Rigby: Whoa, who are all these dead guys?

Skips: They must lost their battles against their stress. (A skeleton splits in half. The guys get Skips onto the bell) Thanks. Now, what I'm about to tell you is really important. You have to keep your ears covered for as long as the bell is ringing.

Mordecai: Ok, Skips.

Skips: Rigby, what did I just say?

Rigby: Keep our ears covered.

Skips: For as long as the bell rings. Good. Now go! Go! Get out of here! Far away!

Rigby: Good luck, Skips! (Pops, Benson, Mordecai and Rigby run away from the bell and cover their ears. Skips then rings the bell, producing a long, loud sound. He screams as the stress exits his body and transforms into a stress monster that looks like Skips.) Cool. (Skips grunts and charges at the monster, but it grabs hims. Rigby spots the ninja sword.) Skips, you forgot your ninja sword! (runs to grab the sword)

Mordecai: Rigby, no! (uncovers his ears and grabs Rigby)

(Pops and Benson uncover their ears and grab Rigby also.)

Benson: Cover your ears!

(Rigby is still trying to get to the sword, but he screams as his stress exits his body and the four of them float into the sky.)

Skips: No!

(The stress exit the four of them, who fall back down, and goes into Skips' stress, causing it to squirm around and form 4 more stress heads; one of Rigby, one of Pops, one of Benson and of of Mordecai.)

Mordecai: What the heck?!

Rigby: I gotta get the ninja sword! (grabs the sword, then runs to Skips) Skips! (throws the sword to Skips, who sees and swiftly catches it. Skips whips it out of the case and start fighting the stress.)

Skips: Let me handle this! (screams as he charges at the stress, but is thrown away by its tentacles. He rolls and slices them off, but is soon grabbed by the tentacles again. The stress monster throws him into a statue, and grabs him by the neck)

Rigby: We gotta help him!

Benson: Yeah! Let's get this thing!

(They all scream and charge. They start grabbing weapons left behind behind by the skeletons, and start going at their own stress head. Mordecai screams at he runs to his stress head, but he is whacked by its tentacles. Pops' stress head grabs him.)

Benson: Leave Pops alone! (bangs his weapon on the head, only to be grabbed into the head.)

(Rigby pokes his weapon at his stress head, but is whacked away.)

Pops: It's too powerful!

Skips: (slicing a tentacle) We gotta cut off all of its heads!

(All the stress head roar. Mordecai gets up.)

Mordecai: Time to de-stress. (starts dodging the tentacles as he runs toward the stress head. He finally cut it off, causing it to vanish.)

(Pops runs back toward his stress head, cuts off it tentacles and finally slices it off. Benson is caught by the tentacle of his stress head, and screams as he heads towards it.)

Rigby: (running to the stress head with his weapon) Hold on!

Benson: No, no, no! Rigby, don't! (Rigby throws his weapon at the tentacle, disabling it. Benson screams as he falls. He grabs his weapon and hits the stress head) Thanks!

Rigby: No problem. (shields himself from a tentacle, and screams as he slices his stress head down, causing it to vanish.)

(Benson is caught by the tentacles again, as Pops runs to him.)

Pops: Benson, take these! (throws tiny axes at Benson, who throws them at his stress head's eyeballs, causing it to explode)

(Everyone except Skips is taken aback from the vibration. They watch Skips as he is fighting his stress head. Skips continues using his ninja sword and chops at the tentacles. He leaps up on top as the head dodges, and lunges the sword into it. The head pop back up and the monsters uses its tentacles to grab the sword and throw it aside.)

Everyone: Skips! (they are knocked aside by a tentacle)

(The monster has Skips in his grip, but he breaks out and runs down the monster, who is clinging onto him. He jumps down and sees a spear on the ground. He grabs it and turns around to stab it in the monster, going straight through it and causing it to completely vanish. Skips pants heavily. Everyone comes and cheers for him.)

Mordecai: We're sorry we made you so stressed out, Skips.

Skips: Ah, forget it. And thanks for helping me out back there.

Benson: This isn't going to happen again. We could all stand to do more of our own work without bothering you for help.

Skips: I enjoy helping my friends, but, uh, that might not be such a bad idea.

(They all head back to Carmenita.)

Pops: Oh my.

Mordecai: What's wrong?

(We see the weapons jammed into a tire.)

Pops: We've got a flat tire.

Skips: I'll take care of it! (opens the boot, but notices the guys staring at him. He back away as they try to fix it.)

Pops: Here's the tire iron.

Mordecai: I'll grab the jack.

Rigby: I got the spare.

Benson: Oh, let me help you with that.

(The episode ends with Skips smiling)

(Episode begins with the guys at Stardust Lanes as Skips bowls a strike)

Benson: Man, Skips is on fire tonight. Another perfect game.

Mordecai: We're going to the championship baby!

Man: You guys wouldn't be so great if it wasn't for Skips.

Mordecai: Well, we can't help that he's just plain awesome, right Skips?

Skips: Hey, that's just how I roll.

Mordecai, Rigby and Benson: Ooooooooh!

Benson: There she is guys. Isn't she a beaut?

Rigby: I want that beaut.

Benson: So who are we up against?

Mordecai: Some team called the Magical Elements.

Rigby: The Magical Elements. Hm, hm, more like the Magical Loserments.

Death: (offscreen) What did you say about us?

(Screen goes to Death, Gary and the leader of The Guardians of Eternal Youth)

Death: So, you blokes must be the Park Strikers. If you ask me, you're in for quite a beatdown.

Guardian: Yes, our team has stood undefeated for thousands of years. No mortal stands a chance against the Magical Elements.

Gary: Shouldn't be a problem, these guys are out of their element for even being here.

Rigby: No, you're out of your element. You and your lame matching uniforms. I bet those aren't even...

(Gary makes Rigby's mouth go away)

Bowling Manager: Hey, what did I tell you guys about using magic? Do you want to be in this league, well then no magic stuff alright?

(Gary makes Rigby's mouth reappear)

Death: No matter, magic or not, we're still gonna beat you chumps.

Skips: Well, that's just your opinion, Death.

Death: No, its a fact: get used to it!

Rigby: Get used to this. We're gonna rub those trophies in your face, right after we rub these bowling bags in your face.

Mordecai, Rigby and Benson: Ooooooooh!

Death: (growls)

(Cuts to to Giorgio's Tower of Pizza)

Benson: Who would of thought that a manatory team building activity would get us to the championship.

Mordecai: Thanks to my power hook.

Rigby: No way! Thanks to my atomic fireball!

Benson: And because of my backup ball. (laughs) Who are we kidding? Our team would suck without this guy.

Mordecai: Yeah-yuh! With Skips, we got the Magical Elements beat.

Benson: To Skips, the only reason we're gonna win.

Skips: Alright guys, I'll be back.

Waiter: Ok, we got a carnivore deluxe here.

Rigby: Oh yeah, yeah!

Benson: Finally!

(Scene goes to Skips washing his hands in the bathroom. He hears Death laugh)

Skips: I know it's you, Death.

(Death comes out of a stall)

Death: Ello, Skips.

Skips: What do you want? I gotta get back to dinner with my friends.

Death: Aw, yes. Friends. Tell me, Skips, these friends - they idolize you yeah?

Skips: Nah nah, it's respect.

Death: I wouldn't respect the Skips I know.

Skips: What are you talking about?

Death: You know that I know that you've been lying to them for a long time. We wouldn't want our little secret to come out now would we?

(Dramatic music plays)

Skips: Death, that's not who I am anymore. If that secret came out, it could ruin me.

Death: Yeah, I guess it could. Sit the game out and I won't tell. Think it over.

(Back at the park house. Mordecai, Rigby and Benson are in the living room)

Benson: First on the agenda is trophy talk. (pulls the paper away revealing a chart of what days each of the guys have the trophy) Who gets the trophy on what day. I think the schedule is more than fair.

(Skips comes into the living room)

Benson: Oh, perfect timing.

Skips: Look, I've got something to say.

(Puts his bowling shirt on the table)

Skips: I can't play in the tournament.

Benson: What?

Mordecai: Why?

Skips: I, I just can't. Sorry.

Benson: Ok. Next on the agenda, losing and how to deal with it, because we're gonna lose.

Mordecai: I'm cool with forfeiting.

Rigby: No! We can't!

Benson: It's just a trophy.

Rigby: That trophy is more than just a trophy. We can't let Death win. Skips isn't the team. We are. The past. That was Skip's time. Skip's time. Now, it's our time! Our time! Sure, this is a setback. But that just means we got to train harder! Are we gonna win that trophy?

Benson and Mordecai: Yeah!

Rigby: Are we gonna wipe that smug look off of Death's face?

Benson and Mordecai: Yeah!

Benson: Ok, who are we gonna get to replace Skips?

(Scene goes to Stardust Lanes and Pops bowls the bowling ball and knocks out one pin)

Pops: Yay! One pin, one pin!

Death: Well, if it isn't the Park Strikers. Hey, what happened to Skips?

(Pops is seen laughing and doing the worm)

Death: Oh, that's not Skips. Just some bloke with a fat head.

(He laughs and Rigby looks worried)

Death: Oh, Rigby, don't forget about our little wager. Good day, gents.

Mordecai: Rigby, what is he talking about?

Rigby: Uh...

(The scene transitions to a flashback of what happened last night when they were dissing the Magical Elements)

Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson: Ohhhhh!!!

(Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, and Skips all walk out of Stardust Bowling Alley until Rigby remembers he forgot is towel)

Rigby: Oh man! I forgot my bowling towel.

(Rigby goes inside to retrieve his bowling towel with "RIGBONE" embroidered on it. He then sees the Magical Elements)

Rigby: You know, you guys shouldn't even show up tomorrow, because there is no way you can win.

(Guardian attempts to kill him, but the rest of the team hold him back)

Death: Calm down, calm down, I got this.

(He then faces Rigby)

Death: You seem pretty sure of yourself, so how about a wager? Your team's souls for these souls?

(Death pulls out a "Soul Ball", which is a glowing green bowling ball filled with ghostly, white souls. Rigby is fascinated by it)

Rigby: Whoaaaaa. Soul ball! I can rub that in so many people's faces. DEAL!

(Rigby and Death shake hands on it. The wager is now in effect.)

(The scene transitions back to present time. The gang isn't happy with what they just heard)

Mordecai: You bet our souls for a ball?

(Mordecai punches Rigby hard in the shoulder)

Rigby: OW! But it had souls in it!

(Mordecai punches Rigby again)

Rigby: Aaaah! I'm sorry. With Skips on our team, we were guaranteed to win! But after he quit, I was too embarrassed to tell you about the bet. But hey, now you know, right?

(Mordecai punches Rigby for the third time. This time, harder)

Rigby: OWWWW!!!

Mordecai: We gotta get Skips back.

(The scene transitions to the gang pulling up into Skip's driveway. The gang gets out, and Benson starts pounding on the door)

Benson: (panickingly) Skips! Skips!

Pops: Look, it's a note! (He points to a yellow note on the WELCOME mat in the front of the door)

Benson: (reading note) Dear, Park Strikers. Something from my past has come back to me to haunt me, and I'm rethinking my life. I'm going...

(The scene transitions to Skips, on the edge of a cliff. Meanwhile, the letter is being narrated by Skips in the background)

Skips: ..to where the road takes me now. You might not see me for awhile. Sorry for letting you down.

(The scene then goes back to Benson, and the rest of the gang)

Benson: Your friend, Skips.

Rigby: What are we going to do now?

Benson: There is only one thing we can do! Kiss our souls goodbye.

(The scene transitions to the gang in Benson's station wagon, all looking very depressed)

Benson: So, we're all feeling a bit abandoned. Do you know what would help? Some tunes.

(Benson goes to turn the dial on the radio station. Unfortunately, it is playing sad music. A depressing montage begins as they drive through town with death-related signs around them. In the forest, Skips is shown burning old bowling memorabilia. Meanwhile, back at the Stardust Lanes, we see the Park Strikers sad, with the Magical Elements right by side them on top of their van with people cheering below them. Back at the forest, Skips is shown looking at old bowling photos. At the Stardust Lanes, the Park Strikers walk in sad, with Muscle Man eating chips, while HFG floats right by side him, then the Park Strikers meet with the Magical Elements, looking at the Park Strikers confidently. Back at the forest, Skips continues looking at old bowling photos. When he sees a note from the rest of the team thanking him for never letting them down, his eyes filled with tears.)

(Back at the bowling alley the Park Strikers look sad and scared while The Magical Elements prepare to win)

Announcer: We're live at the Stardust Lanes for the final game of the tournament: Park Strikers versus Magical Elements. Tonight the Strikers are not only playing for that trophy - they're playing for their souls. Ha ha ha! Benson of the Strikers is up.

Benson: Come on, come on. You can get this.

Announcer: He needs that spare.

Death: Oi, Benson! (the Magical Elements join in) Choke! Choke! Choke! Choke!

(Benson hits just five of the remaining nine pins and sighs. Death roughly pushes him out of the way and bowls a strike)

Announcer: Ho ho! Holy cow! That's another strike for the Magical Elements by Death - and another doozy for the Park Strikers, who are off to a rough start.

Benson: You're up, Pops.

Pops: Oh, time to bid my soul adieu.

Rigby: Wait - look!

(On the score monitor a large arm appears and rubs out the name "POPS", writing "SKIPS" in its place).

Park Strikers: Skips!

(Skips bowls a perfect strike and the Park Strikers cheer)

Death: That's it!!!

(Death grabs the Soul Ball)

Death: Time to kick that up a notch!

Bowling Manager: Hey, what did I tell you about using magic--!?!?

(The Bowling Manager is collapsed into nothing by Gary's magic. Death throws the Soul Ball at the Park Strikers - they dodge it and it swerves onto the lane before hitting another strike, breaking the pins)

Death: Top that, losers.

Skips: Let's bowl.

(A bowling montage follows with the Park Strikers bowling fairly and the Magical Elements using magic tricks to win while the crowd cheers. The Magical Elements even use magic to prevent the Park Strikers from scoring)

Announcer: And we're down to the final frame, folks - the two teams are neck and neck. The Park Strikers are just one strike away from victory.

(The Guardian, Gary, and the Wizard are prepared to use their spells on the Park Strikers)

Death: (to Magical Elements) Wait, you guys. I've got this. (Walks to Skips) Remember our little convo, Skips? Shall I tell 'em your secret?

Mordecai: Secret? What secret?

Benson: What does he mean, Skips?

(Long pause)

Skips: My friends' souls are more important than my secret. You wanna tell 'em my real name isn't Skips? Go ahead.

(Skips bowls straight down the lane. The Magical Elements try to destroy the lane - and the alley - with their spells, but Skips' ball hits the last pin and a strike is scored)

Pops: Yay!

Benson: Yeah!

Rigby: Yeah!

(The crowd and Park Strikers cheer)

Announcer: Against all odds the Strikers win it! Yeah!

(Death grunts)

Rigby: And I believe you owe me a soul ball!

(Death throws the ball at Rigby's stomach)

Death: Take it. I've got a billion just like it. I can wait for a few more. Magical Elements - out.

(The Magical Elements spontaneously combust and the crowd rushes out to the lanes. The announcer presents the Park Strikers with the trophy)

Photographer: Strikers, strike a pose!

(Flash cuts to Benson's car. Rigby is tapping the soul ball, which roars quietly when he does so)

Rigby: Cool. This thing totally rules!

Mordecai: Yeah, it does!

Benson: Skips, I don't mean to pry but why did you change your name to Skips?

Skips: Eh, I just got tired of people asking me why my name was Walks when I always skipped.

Benson: So why do you skip?

Rigby: Yeah, why do you do that?

Mordecai: Ha ha! Yeah, I've been wondering that.

Skips: Y'know, I think you guys have heard enough secrets for one night.

Benson, Mordecai, Rigby: Aww.

Mordecai: I think it's broken, dude.

Rigby: Here, try this.

Skips: Hey, something need to be fixed in here?

Mordecai: Skips, come help us.

Rigby: Yeah, Skips can fix anything.

Skips: What's broken?

Rigby: So we created this project in "E-designer Plus", right?

Mordecai: Then we tried printing it, but it gave error 219.

Skips: Uh huh.

Rigby: We double-checked and the driver is definitely installed.

[From Skips' point of view: Mordecai and Rigby make computer sounds and point to various computer parts]

Mordecai: So you can fix it?

Skips: (unsure) Sure. [taps a key with a hammer]

Skips: [gasps and roars as he prepares to smash the computer] We gotta destroy this!

Mordecai: No! Stop! [he and Rigby grunt and try to stop him]

Rigby: Skips, it's just a computer!

Mordecai: Put it down, dude!

Skips: Fellas, I've been around the block a few times. There's something evil in that computer, we gotta smash it.

Rigby: Please, stop!

Mordecai: You don't know how to fix this, do you?

Skips: What!?

Rigby: [points at Skips] Well, you totally don't know how to fix this, do you?

Rigby: Ow!

Mordecai: Skips, it's okay. You don't have to know how to fix everything! Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

Skips: [skips to the door and pauses] I can fix anything, you know.

Mordecai: Yeah, Skips, we know.

Rigby: Dude, I thought Skips could fix everything.

Mordecai: Well, yeah, but not computers. Come on, let's figure this out ourselves.

Skips: Mordecai, Rigby! I figured out how to fix error 219. [skips up to computer and presses a button]

Mordecai: Skips, what are you doing!?

Skips: I was just trying to fix your error 219!

Rigby: [groans] But it's not a 219 anymore!

Mordecai: Yeah, while you were gone, we messed it up and now it's an error 220!

Rigby: [groans] Dude, it's even worse now!

Mordecai: Look, Skips, it's fine. We called someone to come fix it.

Skips: You what? Look guys, I can do this. I just need more time. When is this guy supposed to get here?

Mordecai: In an hour.

Skips: Okay, look, I can take care of this. If he gets here before me, stall him.

Mordecai: Why?

Skips: Just do it!

Rigby: Geez!

Mordecai: Okay, okay!

Rigby: Man, what's Skips' problem?

Mordecai: I don't know. I think he needs to realize there's some things he just can't fix.

Skips: I need to know how to fix an error 220.

Employee 1: Guh, we don't know.

Employee 2: Yeah, look it up on the internet.

Skips: I don't know how to use the internet.

Employee 1: Okay, first, open the internet.

Skips: Uh, which one's the internet?

Employee 1: Guh, open the internet! [points at screen] Just use the mouse and click the internet button.

Skips: Uh......... [moves mouse aimlessly]

Employee 1: [points at screen again] Look, see those? They're called programs! [bangs on the screen] Now click the internet to open the internet!

Skips: Uh......... [clicks aimlessly]

Employee 1: No, what are you doing!? You can't just open a ton of programs at once, it just makes the computer go really slow.

Employee 2: Yeah, don't you know?

Employee 1: Guh! You're worse than my parents asking me computer questions over the phone! I'm taking a break.

Employee 2: Yeah, me too.

Employee 1: Hey, Techmo, help this guy with his computer problem, we're taking a break.

Techmo: Skips!

Skips: Techmo. Do I know you?

Techmo: Oh, you probably don't recognize me. My name used to be Sampson. Remember, you fixed my arm back in 1783?

Skips: (lights up) Oh yeah! How's the old arm holding up?

Techmo: Oh, uh, I traded it in for an upgrade a few years back. [hand rotates] Pretty cool, huh? So, what brings you here?

Skips: I'm trying to figure out how to fix an error 220.

Techmo: Pfft, easy. Just hold the power button, wait five seconds and press print. Got that?

Skips: Power... button?

Techmo: Oh boy. [arm sounds] You know what, Skips? I get that you're more of a hands on learner. How 'bout you join me at a house call? See me fix one for real?

Skips: Okay?

Techmo: Let's do this.

Techmo: Wanna hear my band? [puts cassette tape in]

Skips: [groans] Oh, great, your house call's in this house?

Techmo: [walks towards house] Remember when you fixed my arm here? Hard to believe it used to be a battle field, huh?

Mordecai: You're making it worse!

Rigby: Stop pressing things!

Techmo: What did you guys do!?

Mordecai: Techmo! Come quick!

Rigby: Hurry!

Skips: [walks in] Whoa.

Mordecai: Oh, uh, hey Skips.

Skips: Thanks for stalling him.

Techmo: [sits down] Okay, dudes, brief me.

Rigby: It still won't print our file.

Mordecai: The monitor just started flashing.

Rigby: [gives Techmo paper] And about twenty minutes ago, these started coming out of the printer.

Techmo: A threatening haiku? This is mad. Don't worry, dudes. [pulls out keyboard and plugs in] Elevate keyboard! [second keyboard appears]

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Skips: What the-

Techmo: [cracks knuckles] Error 220, let's dance.

Techmo: [groans in frustration] Elevate keyboard! [third keyboard appears]

Skips: Can somebody fill me in on what's happening!? Are we still just trying to print something!?

Techmo: This is the worst error 220 I've ever seen. I've got no choice - I'm jacking in. [connects himself to the computer]

Skips: Are you sure we just can't smash it?

Mordecai: Skips! Just let him do his thing!

Skips: Alright.

Techmo:  [plugs wire into his head] I'm in!

Techmo: I see it! [runs towards error 220 and unsheaths sword] Error 220! Prepare to be pwned!

Techmo: What!?

Techmo: Error 220!?

Doom Ma Geddon: No, technomancer. It was I, the Doom Ma Geddom virus all along! Thanks to you, we will now be able to digitize the external world!

Techmo: Wait, we!?

Doom Ma Geddon: Yes. Prepare to be assimilated! [wires begin to move] Resistance is dumb! [wires trap Techmo]

Techmo: Noooo!

Techmo: Skips! Remember how I told you never to smash a computer? I was wrong! [collapses]

Doom Ma Geddon: Thank you for releasing the Doom Ma Geddon virus. Goodbye. [shoots wires out, each wire digitizing anything it touches]

Skips: I knew that computer was evil! We've gotta destroy it before it's too late.

Mordecai: Don't worry, Skips, we got this!

Skips: Techmo, no!

Doom Ma Geddon: There is no more Techmo, only Doom Ma Geddon. [sends giant cursor flying towards Skips] Now die!

Mordecai: He's just too fast.

Skips: Too fast?

Rigby: What are we gonna do?

Skips: On the count of three, you guys make a break for the keyboard and keep opening programs, as many as you can.

Mordecai: Okay, got it.

Rigby: What're you gonna do?

Skips: Me? [picks up sledgehammer] I'm gonna fix this. Okay, one, two three! [runs to Doom Ma Geddon]

Doom Ma Geddon: A sledgehammer? Really? An analogue relic in a digital world. [pushes Skips] Ironic, really, that a dinosaur like you will be the first thing to be digitized. Goodbye. [laughs]

Doom Ma Geddon: What did you do!?

Skips: Don't you know? If you open a bunch of programs, you'll slow down. [does a javelin throw with the sledgehammer]

Doom Ma Geddon: No, no no!

Techmo: [rises] Wow. Skips, I gotta say, I've know some great technomancers in my day, but none of them have defeated Doom Ma Geddon! If I had the authority, I'd make you an honorary technomancer.

Skips: Thanks, Techmo.

Techmo: [arm alarm sounds] Well, duty calls. [teleports away]

Skips: [gasps] No! [charges towards printer]

Mordecai: [stops Skips] Skips, wait! This is what we were trying to print all along! [hands paper to Skips]

Skips: Huh? [reads paper out loud] 'Thanks Skips for all your help around the park. We all really appreciate you, Mordo and Rigs.' Aww, thanks fellas.

Mordecai: Aww man. Benson's gonna kill us when he sees all this broken stuff.

Rigby: Maybe if we bury everything in the yard he'll never know!

Skips: You guys just leave it to me.

Mordecai and Rigby: Thanks, Skips.

(Episode begins with Mordecai and Rigby picking up roadkill in the park.)

Rigby: (after finding a dead animal, marking a square on the bingo card) Ha-ha, dude, we only need a few more for a bingo! Up high!

Mordecai: This is totally gross, you know. I can't believe Benson made a dead animal bingo card to force us to pick up roadkill.

Rigby: So what? We have to pick up roadkill in the park anyway, it's part of our job. We might as well try to have a little fun while we're doin' it. Besides, Benson said we can stop once we get a bingo, so come on, man! Up high!

Mordecai: Ugh, fine. (gives Rigby a high-five) I still think you're enjoying this too much.

(shows them picking up road-kill, then shows a title card that says 8 hours later)

Mordecai: Dude, I think we've picked everything up.

Rigby: Don't worry dude, we're close. I can smell it! (sniffs) Ah, dude, if you're gonna crack one off in the cart, you could at least warn me!

Mordecai: Dude, it's not me. Look!

(They stop the cart they're in and see a huge skunk in the road, thinking it's dead.)

Mordecai: Ugh, skunk!

Rigby: Wait, skunk?!

(Rigby looks at the bingo card, seeing that finding a skunk can get them a bingo, Rigby gasps)

Rigby: Dude, Bingo!

Mordecai: Bingo?

Rigby: Bing-o-o-o-o-o-o, bing-o-o-o-o-o-o!

Mordecai: Bing-o-o-o-o-o-o!

Mordecai and Rigby: Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

Mordecai: Woahhhhh!!!

Rigby: (walks up to the skunk) Bing-o-o-o-o! Aah!

(The skunk sprays Rigby after waking up, with Mordecai holding his breath and trying to stay out of the stink cloud the skunk has formed)

Mordecai: (gasps; breathing heavily) Rigby?! You okay?

(Rigby coughs)

Skunk: Hey, whoa, whoa, watch it, watch it!

Rigby: What the heck, man?!

Skunk: You guys think you can just walk up to a guy in broad daylight and mug him without him fighting back?

Rigby: We weren't mugging you! We thought you were dead!

Skunk: I was taking a nap!

Rigby: In the middle of the road?!

Skunk: Oh, who are you - Mr. King Sandman, telling people where they can and cannot sleep?!

Mordecai: Sorry, we thought you were dead. We were just excited. We thought we got a bingo.

Skunk: So because you thought I was dead, you thought you got a bingo? What kind of sick game is that?!

Mordecai: It's our boss made us... Well, okay, look  no bingo. No bingo.

Rigby: Well, how do I get rid of this smell?

Skunk: Ha! You think you just get to turn it off? No, I'm stuck with it, and now so are you.

Rigby: Come on dude, don't be a jerk! Tell me how to get rid of this.

Skunk: (angrily) Oh, I'm a jerk! (enlarges and picks Rigby up in the air) (yelling in a monstrous voice) Raaaaarr! You don't know what I am! Let's see how you like when you can't turn it off!

Mordecai: Let him go! (appears with a shovel) Let him go or I'm gonna make you wish you were road kill. (Skunk drops Rigby) Now get lost!

Skunk: (shrinks) You two are disgusting. I'm outta here! (walks off)

Rigby: Wait, at least tell me how to get this smell off!

Skunk: (yelling) Yeah, right! Figure it out for yourself! (walks through a hole in a fence)

Rigby: What?! Aaaagh! What am I gonna do now?

Mordecai: I don't know dude, but we gotta get that smell off you. It reeks.

(angered, Rigby's eyes grow, his body swells and grows furry, he picks up Mordecai by the neck, choking him)

Rigby: (growling; in a monstrous voice) Don't tell me about how I smell! I know it reeks! You don't think I know it reeks?!

(Mordecai chokes before Rigby lets Mordecai go. As Mordecai catches his breath, Rigby turns back to normal)

Rigby: (back to normal; gasps) What was that?! What did that thing do to me?!

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta find Skips.

(They find Skips outside his house.)

Skips: That was a Were-Skunk.

Rigby: What?

Skips: Yeah. And if you don't get that smell off, you'll turn into one too, you know.

Rigby: What?! What do I do?!

Skips: This is bad. This isn't regular skunk spray. You could try taking a shower. Or if that doesn't work, coffee will dehydrate you and draw some of the smell out, maybe.

Rigby: Seriously, a shower? Coffee? Come on!

(enlarges into a furious monster)

Rigby: (monstrous voice) You think you're so smart, don't you?! "Oh look at me, I'm Skips, I know everything because I'm so old, let me tell you how to fix your problems in a really lame way!" Well, you know what I think? (growls and grabs Skips) You don't know nothin'! You don't know nothin'! (Throws Skips down and shrinks back to normal size.)

Rigby: (back to normal; gasps) Dude, that wasn't me! Skips, I'm sorry!

Skips: (coughs) Forget it, it's fine. But you better get changed back soon. Because once the transformation is complete, you won't wanna change back.

(The duo go to the house)

Benson: What are you doing here? There's no way you got a bingo that fast. (sniffs and coughs) Ugh! What happened?!

Mordecai: Rigby got sprayed by a were-skunk.

Benson: A what?! Ugh!

Rigby: Look, we don't have time. We have to get him cleaned up.

Benson: Ugh! Fine! But don't think this counts as an excuse to get out of your work. You still have to fill out that bingo card. Ugh! (runs into the house while coughing)

(Mordecai is outside the bathroom while Rigby takes a shower)

Mordecai: Dude, I looked all over the internet. We should probably try Skips' coffee idea if the shower doesn't work.

(The shower turns off.)

Mordecai: Dude, did it work? Come on, come out!

(The door opens and it clearly did not work)

Mordecai: Ugh!

Rigby: I used everything, man -- the shampoo, the conditioner, the cologne, and the deodorant.

Mordecai: Man, I thought for sure the shampoo would work. Did you lather, rinse, and repeat?

Rigby: Yeah, I lathered, rinsed, and repeated! I used the whole bottle! (in his monstrous voice) What, you think I don't know how to wash my own hair?! Aah!

(Rigby transforms again, throws Mordecai off the hallway wall, and shrinks back to normal size again.)

Rigby: Mordecai, I'm sorry!

Mordecai: (groans) Just try and take it easy, okay?

Rigby: I'm sorry.

Mordecai: Look, we should go to the coffee shop.

(At the coffee shop, a customer runs outside and gasps from the smell.)

Mordecai: Just relax. I'm gonna go get you a coffee, okay? Relax.

(Rigby puts his face on the desk and whimpers as Mordecai goes to talk to Margaret and Eileen .)

Mordecai: Hey guys  heh, uh gals. Heh. Um, I need a coffee for Rigby  quick.

Margaret: What's wrong?

Mordecai: He got sprayed by a were-skunk.

Eileen: Oh, no!

Margaret: What are you guys doing here, then?

Mordecai: We heard coffee might cure him, but I don't know.

Eileen: Oh no, poor guy. I'm gonna go take him a coffee.

(The three take a coffee to the table.)

Eileen: Hey, Rigby.

Rigby: It's about time. (He slurps the cup of coffee)

Mordecai: Well? Did it work?

(Rigby sniffs himself and whimpers again.)

Eileen: Maybe you have to pour it on yourself?

Rigby: (scoffs) Fine.

(Rigby pours the hot coffee on himself and screams in pain, flying off his stool and onto the floor.)

Mordecai: Did it work?

Rigby: Argh! No! It was just really hot!

(Eileen giggles)

Rigby: You think this is funny?!

(Rigby transforms and lifts Eileen into the air.)

Rigby: (monstrous voice) Well, I don't think it's funny! This is my life you're laughing at!!

Mordecai: Rigby, stop! Stop!

(Rigby sees an angry, shocked crowd of customers, and a scared Eileen)

Eileen: Rigby, you're scaring me!

(Rigby looks full of regret, puts down Eileen, and turns back to normal)

Rigby: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... (runs out of the store in embarrassment)

Mordecai: Rigby, wait!

(Rigby shoves his way through a crowd of pedestrians, grabs the cart, and drives off into the park hills, finding the Were-Skunk's home.)

Rigby: Where are you at, skunk?!

(Rigby pounds the door)

Rigby: Skunk, come out! I know you're in there!

(The door opens and the skunk comes outside.)

Skunk: What?! Oh. It's you. What are you doing here?

Rigby: You have to tell me how to get rid of this.

Skunk: Why would I do that? I'm a huge jerk, remember?

Rigby: I'm sorry. You're not a jerk. Please just tell me how to stop this.

Skunk: Heh. Thing is, I'm sick of being the only skunk in town. Always getting dirty looks, people yelling at you, people hating you 100% of the time. Nah, with you as a skunk, things won't be so bad. All that negative attention won't fall just on me. It'll fall on you, too. We'll split it, fifty-fifty... partner.

Rigby: Noooooooo!

(Rigby transforms and dives for the Were-Skunk, knocking him onto his back into the house.)

Rigby: (punching the skunk) (monstrous voice) Tell me! Tell me how to end this! TELL ME!!

Skunk: (laughing) It's Pineapple Juice, but it's too late anyway. The transformation's already started, partner.

(Rigby runs for the cart and drives back down the hill. However, his hands turn black and like a skunk, causing the cart to melt beneath him. He sprouts a tuft of white hair on his forehead like that of a skunk. He continues to morph into a skunk as he runs home, the path melting behind him. He makes it to the house and dives through the closed front door.)

Benson: What the heck?

(Rigby jumps at Benson, knocking him to the ground, and continues to the kitchen, opening cabinets)

Rigby: There's the Pineapple Juice!

(Rigby struggles to find a can opener in the drawer)

Rigby: Come on, come on! (finally finds one) Yeah! (opens the can and pours it on himself; however, no effect is occurring) Ahh... it's not working!

(The skunk is in the kitchen, laughing evilly)

Skunk: Come on, you didn't think I'd tell you what the real cure was, did you? It's not Pineapple Juice. I was just stalling you so you'd run out of time. Don't worry. Once you're like me, you'll never wanna switch back.

(Rigby's transformation continues, and he screams out "Nooooooooooooo!" in anguish, as the skunk laughs.)

Skunk: Huh?

(Through the window, Mordecai is driving towards the house in a golf cart.)

Mordecai: Rigby! Rigby!

(He tries to get inside but the skunk locks the back door)

Mordecai: Dude, open the door!

Skunk: It's too late - he's my friend now!

Mordecai: Rigby, I've figured it out! It's Tomato Paste! The cure is Tomato Paste!

(Rigby dives for the cabinet and grabs the paste. A long and brutal fight breaks out as the skunk tries to prevent Rigby from opening the can. The skunk sprays Rigby dozens of times and looks to have won the battle)

Skunk: Don't worry, it's almost over, and then you and I will split the skunkin' duties at this park for the rest of eternity!

(Tire-screeching is heard, and a light appears)

Skunk: Huh? (gasps)

(Mordecai crashes through the wall on the golf cart, sending the skunk flying to the ground. The cart hits the wall, and Mordecai is trapped under it, coughing and groaning. The skunk approaches)

Skunk: You think you can stop me from splitting my pain with your friend? You can't stop it. You can't stop nothin'.

Mordecai: You're right, I can't stop it. But Rigby can.

(Mordecai throws the tomato paste to Rigby, who is holding a sledgehammer. Rigby stops the can with his foot, and the camera pans up Rigby's body, to reveal that his Were-Skunk transformation is almost complete.)

Rigby: (monstrous voice) Split this...

(Rigby smashes the can with the hammer and tomato paste flies across the room. Rigby turns back to normal.)

Mordecai: Ha ha ha, we did it! Yeah!

Rigby: Yeah, we did it, yeah!

(A human in a t-shirt and shorts is lying on the floor. He coughs)

Ex-Skunk Human: Thank... you! (makes a very weak grunt and passes out)

Mordecai: He still counts as a skunk, right?

Rigby: Totally counts as a skunk.

(Mordecai marks the skunk box on the bingo card.)

Mordecai: Bingo!

Mordecai and Rigby: Bing-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

(Mordecai throws away the bingo list. The two high five.)

Mordecai: Hunh! Ha ha ha! Yeah!

(End of Skunked)

(Episode begins with Pops' house. Mordecai and Rigby are playing a video game.)

Mordecai: Which way am I gonna go? Which way am I gonna go?

(Phone rings in the background. The guys are revealed to be playing a basketball game. Mordecai's player makes a slam dunk)

Mordecai: Stuffed again!

(Pops come into the room with the phone.)

Pops: Mordecai, it's for you.

Mordecai: Dude, pause it.

(Mordecai stops playing but Rigby continues. Mordecai slaps him

Mordecai (continued): Pause it!

(Mordecai gets up to answer the phone.)

Rigby: Okay! Okay! Geez.

(Mordecai answers the phone from the hallway.)


Mordecai: Hello?


Margaret: Hey, Mordecai. It's Margaret.

(Mordecai is shocked. Meanwhile, Rigby is still playing.)


Rigby: Which way am I gonna go? Which way am I gonna go?

(Rigby makes a shot with his player and laughs.)

Rigby (continued): Eat on that, Mordecai.

(He notices Mordecai coming back and pauses the game.)

Mordecai: Dude! Dude! Margaret just called.

Rigby: What? Why?

Mordecai: She wants me to make her a website.

Rigby: Boo! What about our game of "Hoop Jams 5000?" Mordecai?

(He is running upstairs to the computer room.)

Rigby (continued): Ugh!

(Rigby goes to the computer room, where Mordecai is getting started.)

Rigby (continued): Mordecai! Come on, man!

(He takes the sheet of paper on the desk.)

Rigby (continued): You can't even do it right now, anyway. Muscle Man has the computer for the whole day.

(The signup sheet has Muscle Man for the whole day.)


Mordecai: What?

(He looks out the window.)

Mordecai (continued): He's not even here. He's playing basketball.

(We cut to Muscle Man and Fives playing basketball.)


Muscle Man: Boom-skaka-laka!

Mordecai: Oh, well. You snooze, you lose. I'm sure this will only take a second anyways.

(He starts up the computer, but Muscle Man suddenly appears at the door.)

Muscle Man: What are you doing?

(He breathes.)

Muscle Man (continued): Did you not see the sign-up sheet?

Mordecai: You were outside playing basketball. I figured...

Muscle Man: Oh, you figured? You figured you'd use the computer on someone else's time slot?
Mordecai: Well, dude...

Muscle Man: You wait your turn just like everybody else in this joint. Now get lost. I got to watch my downloads.

(Mordecai and Rigby go into their room.)

Mordecai: Ugh! Why does he have to be such a jerk?

(Muscle Man is laughing in the background. Mordecai and Rigby look out the window and see he's playong basketball again.)

Mordecai: Oh, forget this.
Muscle Man: Did I not make myself clear?
Mordecai: What? You're not even using it!
Muscle Man: I'm waiting for an e-mail from this hottie I met online yesterday.
Rigby: What? You met your mom online yesterday?
Muscle Man: Why you got to take it there bro? Oh, you fools definitely aren't getting the computer now.
Rigby: Who you calling fool?
Mordecai: Dude, I need the computer to make a webpage for Margaret. How about we play you a game of basketball for it?
Muscle Man: Puff! Ha! Ha! Ha! You guys don't stand a chance.
Mordecai: Oh, yeah. Winner gets the computer for a week.
Muscle Man: Oh, you're on. All right, ladies. Why don't you go first?
Mordecai: Check.
Muscle Man: Mate.
Mordecai: Uh!
Muscle Man: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Mordecai: Ah!
Muscle Man: Yeah, baby. Go ahead. You can't make it from there. Oh! Oh! Brick!
Mordecai: Ugh!
Muscle Man: Oh, snap. Hey, Mordecai, you're looking a little confused. Did you know that we only need one more point to win?
Mordecai: What?
Muscle Man: Uh! Boom-shaka-laka! Computer rights for a week! You know who else likes to score so she can get computer rights for a week? My mom!
Margaret: Hey, Mordecai. Thanks for helping me with the website.
Mordecai: No problem. Muscle Man, computer rights for a month.
Muscle Man: I don't know, bro. I think it's worth more to you than that.
Mordecai: Two months.
Muscle Man: Deal. Wo-ho! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yes! Two months of computer rights. Looks like Margaret will just have to go without her webpage, you loser. Huh!
Mordecai: Ugh! This can't be happening! Basketball sucks!
Basketball King: What did you say about basketball?
Mordecai: Uh. Nothing.
Basketball King: Yeah. That's what I thought. You know, you only think it sucks because you don't know the fundamentals.
Muscle Man: Save your breath, old man. These jokers are a lost cause.
Basketball King: Not to me, they're not. I'm the best basketball coach that ever lived. I can train anybody.
Muscle Man: Whatever, Grandpa. If you want to waste your time, that's your business. I got three years of computer time I need to start using. Come on, Fives. Let's go check the weather report.
Basketball King: Don't worry, Mordecai and Rigby. I'm going to teach you to play circles around that little pot-bellied leprechaun. How does that sound?
Mordecai: That sounds awesome.
Basketball King: Man, I don't believe this. Did you guys seriously have to be the worst basketball players of all time?
Mordecai: Dude, come on. We're trying our best.
Rigby: Yeah. We just need a little more practice.
Basketball King: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! No! You just need to not play basketball, but I can't have that pudgy green idiot talking trash about my coaching, so, so I'm just going to give you the powers.
Mordecai and Rigby: Ah! Sweet!
Basketball King: Now ice that green fool so you can make that hot chick a webpage.
Mordecai: Sup now, losers? You ready to get destroyed?
Muscle Man: I don't know if I have the energy to see how bad that old man trained you. If I'm going to get out of this seat, you're going to have to make it worth my time.
Mordecai: Computer rights for life. One game, winner takes all.
Muscle Man: Oh! Ho! This is going to be too sweet. Now that the stakes are serious, we're going to play a real game of basketball. First person to twenty-one wins. Street rules!
Mordecai: Fine with me.
Muscle Man: What? How did you?
Rigby: Stay out my kitchen!
Mordecai: Denied!
Muscle Man: What? Impossible!
Rigby: Oh!
Muscle Man: No one could've trained them that crazy. Take a dive, Fives. I've got a plan.
Hi Five Ghost: Ah! Oh!
Muscle Man: Oh, dudes! Fives is hurt.
Mordecai: Dude, get up.
Muscle Man: Hey, bro. You just took out my teammate. Now I get to choose anyone in the park and I choose that guy.
Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what?
Rigby: You can't do that.
Basketball King: Sorry, guys, but the rules are the rules. He can't play you two-on-one.
Muscle Man: That's right. You better give me some of those powers, too. Aw, yeah! It's on, ladies. What? What now? W-W-W-W-Which way am I going to go? Which way am I going to go? This is going to be so easy.
Rigby: Yeah, for us. In your face!
Muscle Man: Actually, bro. In yours! Yee! Nineteen-seventeen, us. Game point.
Rigby: Aw, what? How are we losing?
Muscle Man: Um. Maybe because you suck and I hate you!
Mordecai and Rigby: Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!
Muscle Man: Oh, snap!
Rigby: How does it feel to know that you're going to have to use the Internet at your mom's for the rest of your life?
Muscle Man: Joke all you want, Rigby, but the next basket wins the game and you guys are going down.
Rigby: Come on. D up, Mordecai.
Basketball King: You better listen to your friend, Mordecai, because this is about to get serious up in here.
Muscle Man: Let go of it!
Basketball King: Hold on!
Mordecai: I'm open! I'm open!
Muscle Man: Oh, no!
Rigby: Do it!
Mordecai: Aw. Dude, we did it. We won!
Rigby: Yeah!
Muscle Man (coughs) Oh, no, bro.
Rigby: Yeah! We get the computer for life!
Basketball King: Hey, guys, good game.
Mordecai: Thanks, man.
Rigby: Yeah, thanks, dude.
Muscle Man: Man, I could've kept Fives in there and he still would've played better "D" than you.
Basketball King: Come on, man. That was a good game.
Muscle Man: Whatever. I'm out of here.
Basketball King: I hope he doesn't give up on basketball because of this. That guy could really stad to lose some weight.
Margaret: Mordecai! Hey, Mordecai!
Mordecai: Margaret! Hey! How are you?
Margaret: Good. Good. Hey, you looked pretty hot out there.
Mordecai: Ha! Ha! Yeah. I guess I am pretty hot. Hot on the trail of finishing your website. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Margaret: Oh, the website? That was two months ago, but it's okay. Eileen finished it for me. Got to run.
Mordecai: Ugh!
Basketball King: Time speeds up in space, bro, but hey. Look on the bright side. At least she said you're hot.


(The episode starts at the house. Mordecai and Rigby are sleeping)

Mordecai: Mm. Margaret, more coffee please.

Rigby: I'm the pizza king...

(The door opens and Muscle Man, who's also sleeping, comes in and starts punching Mordecai which causes Rigby to wake up)

Rigby: (Gasps) Muscle Man? Dude!

(Rigby jumps off his bed and attempts to stop Muscle Man but gets punched. He falls to the ground and Muscle Man tries to punch him again but he rolls out of the way and Mordecai holds back Muscle Man's arms)

Mordecai: Muscle Man, quit it!

(Muscle Man head-butts Mordecai, kicks Rigby to the ground, and punches Mordecai in the stomach. Mordecai tackles Muscle Man to the ground but Muscle Man keeps fighting them; Scene goes to morning, Benson is humming and sees a skateboard ramp)

Benson: (Sighs) I thought I told them to clean this up.

(Benson looks up and sees the others, who look beaten up, confronting Muscle Man outside of the house)

Muscle Man: I don't know what happened!

Mordecai: Yeah, right. You're just trying to prank us.

Muscle Man: It's not a prank!

Skips: Yeah, I got a few bruised ribs because of you.

High Five Ghost: You wouldn't stop hitting me until I pretended to be dead.

Pops: You smashed my model train set.

Thomas: How did you even find out where I live?

Muscle Man: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!

Benson: What's going on?

Mordecai: Muscle Man's beating people up in his sleep.

Muscle Man: I wouldn't do that. I hate senseless violence.

(The others look at him)

Muscle Man: I seriously can't remember fighting you guys!

Rigby: At this rate, he's gonna put us all in the hospital. Benson, we gotta do something.

Benson: "We"?

Mordecai: Yeah. This is a park problem. Everyone's gotta be on board.

Benson: This has nothing to do with me. Anything that happens in the park after hours is your own problem.

(Scene goes to later that night at Benson's apartment; Benson is sleeping when Muscle Man opens the door, runs up to Benson and punches him while Benson is surprised; Scene goes to a beat-up Benson the next morning)

Benson: Okay, this is a park problem.

Mordecai: Yeah it is. Thomas lost a tooth last night.

Thomas: I still don't know how he knows where I live...

Mordecai: And Rigby won't go to sleep unless we barricade our bedroom door.

Rigby: Sleep in the hallway if you want, it's your funeral.

Muscle Man: I don't know what's wrong with me. It's not like I want to hurt you guys.

Benson: Yeah, well you obviously have no control over yourself while your sleep fighting.

Skips: Your sleep strength is double your normal strength. Nobody's safe until we get you to stop. We gotta find the source of your problem and take it head on!

Muscle Man: What if I can't be fixed? Am I just be a sleep fighting freak for the rest of my life?

Mordecai: Don't worry Muscle Man. We won't give up until you're cured.

Muscle Man: Thanks guys, you're the best.

(Scene goes to later that night outside of Muscle Man's trailer and a white van with the trunk open near it; it goes to a tied up Muscle Man on his bed and a walkie-talkie is on his nightstand) 

Benson: (On the walkie-talkie) Muscle Man, can you hear me?

Muscle Man: Loud and clear bro.

Benson: (In the van with the others) Okay, we're gonna get started.

Muscle Man: Wait, I understand the ropes (A bunch of cameras are seen all around his room) but what are all these cameras for? (He's seen on five screens in the van) You're not gonna do anything weird, right?

Benson: Relax. We're just gonna watch you sleep.

Skips: We think your sleep fighting is being caused by night terrors. If we figure out what kind of dreams you're having, we might be able to cure you.

Muscle Man: But what if I break out and hurt you guys again?

Mordecai: We pad locked your trailer from the outside, plus you have to get through Rigby and he's wearing a police dog attack suit that we found in the trash.

(Rigby is seen flexing his arms to test the suit)

Rigby: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Mordecai: (On the walkie-talkie) There's no way you can get to us.

Benson: (On the walkie-talkie) Okay, here we go Muscle Man. (Goes to the van) And.... (He presses a button on the keyboard that plays lullaby music on the walkie-talkie)

Muscle Man: Ugh, what is this junk? (He falls asleep and starts snoring)

(Montage of each of the guys watching Muscle Man starts; Benson and Thomas watch, then goes to outside of the van where Mordecai is chasing Rigby and hitting him with a bat to test the suit, Fives watches, then Benson and Pops, then Skips watches, and it ends with Thomas watching the screens while drinking coffee, he stops as he sees Muscle Man waking up)

Thomas: Guys, wake up.

(The guys are seen waking up and walk over to Thomas to see what he's seeing on the screens)

Thomas: I think he's dreaming.

(The screen shows Muscle Man moving around and talking in his sleep)

Skips: Turn up the volume.

(Thomas turns the volume up)

Muscle Man: No, get off of me! Let go!

Benson: Whatever he's seeing, it's intense.

(Muscle Man struggles against the ropes and breaks them and gets out of the bed)

Mordecai: (Gasps) He's breaking loose!

(Muscle Man, who's now sleep fighting, pushes a camera over and then knocks out one of the cameras. One of the five TV screens go static and the guys gasp)

Muscle Man: I'm gonna turn your face into a meatball pizza!

(He picks up a camera and throws it at a camera that's on the ceiling, causing it to go static as well, he then knocks out the remanding cameras and all of the screens go static)

Pops: Look!

(One of the screens shows the room but then goes back to static)

Rigby: Where's Muscle Man? (The screen then goes to the ground, goes static, then goes to the outside of Muscle Man's trailer, goes static, then to the trees, goes static, and finally goes to the guys in the van watching the screen; they turn and see a sleeping Muscle Man, who has the camera wrapped around him, head towards them)

Mordecai: You're on dude.

Rigby: Please don't make me-

(Mordecai pushes him out of the van and closes the trunk, Muscle Man walks up to Rigby who whimpers; cut to the guys in the van watching as Rigby is beat up by Muscle Man, fighting noises are heard and Rigby is screaming, all of them wince and close their eyes )

Rigby: Not the face!

Mordecai: Oh! Sorry Rigby.

Rigby: The suit's not working! UGGGAAAHHHH!!

(More punching and screaming is heard and the torn up suit is thrown at the window; Scene goes to morning and Rigby is moaning, laying on the coach with a ice bag on his head while the other surround him)

Rigby: Thanks a lot guys, for being such great spectators! (He throws the ice bag at Thomas who catches it)

Pops: I do hope we figure this out soon. I don't know how much more chaos I can endure.

Mordecai: So what's Plan B?

Muscle Man: Plan B is to say "Bye, bye, Muscle Man". (Muscle Man is holding two Bags)

Mordecai: What? Where are you going?

Muscle Man: Some place far away where I can't hurt you guys anymore, across town into cheap motels.

Mordecai: What?

Skips: You gotta let us try to help you!

Benson: We just got started!

Muscle Man:  And I'm ending it! Goodbye, bros.

High Five Ghost: (coming down the stairs) Wait! I was going over the surveillance tapes from last night. There's something you guys gotta see.

(Scene cuts to the computer. An ostrich is kicking a ball and then kicks a guy standing by in the groin. Everyone laughs in the background except Muscle Man)

High Five Ghost: Ok, ok. That's not what I wanted to show you guys. Check this out. (the footage is being rewound in a strange way.)

Skips: Could be a technical glitch.

Benson: No, wait. Can you get a closer look, Fives?

(Hi Fives zooms in on that shot.)

Benson: What's that? Off Muscle Man's sweat?

(Hi Fives captures a piece of sweat. There appears to be something weird on it.)

High Five Ghost: Uh, let me enhance the resoluton.

(He does so. The sweat then reveals some strange looking creatures. Everyone is in complete shock.)

Mordecai: Creepy.

Skips: Whoa.

Benson: What is that?

Skips: The camera must have picked up some remnants of your dream.

(Muscle Man backs away)

Benson: Do you recognize these things?

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro!

(The flashback starts with Starla's sister kiss her baby on the cheek)

Ana: Goodbye sweetie. (Picks up the suitcase) Mommy loves you.

Starla: We'll be gone until tomorrow night. Are you sure you can handle this, Mitch?

Muscle Man: Come on, babe. I can take care of a little baby. Go have fun with your sister at your curling tournament.

Starla: Okay.

(The two starts kissing each other)

Starla: Miss you, muscle muffin. (She start to walk away)

Muscle Man: Miss you, too, pork chop, bring home the goal! (He grabs the TV remote from the baby while she was chewing it) Alright, time to switch on the real babysitter.

(He turns on the TV to see the strange purple creatures called Huggstables )

Huggstable #1: Wait, mister bank robber, don't you wanna play?

Robber: You Huggstables stay away from me!

Huggstable #1: I know, let's give him a hug!

(The four Huggstables cheer)

Muscle Man: Pfft, next.

(He press the button and change the channel with three words destroy)

TV Announcer: DESTROY! DESTROY! DESTROY! (The car flew and exploded in the TV) The world's gnarling hit crash pit!

Muscle Man: Alright!

(Tina suddenly starts to cry which distracts Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Are you sick, hungry, you make a mess in your diaper?

(Tina continues to cry as Muscle Man changes back to the Huggstables chasing the Robber)

Robber: No, get back!

All: (They hug the Robber) Hugs.

(Tina starts to clap her hands happily as Muscle Man sighs. In the TV the robber grunting try to get out but too late they turn him into glitter)

Huggstables #2: Ooooh, now he's beautiful glitter! (Giggles) Let's sing the glitter song!

All Huggstables: Glitter Smitters, glitter glitter shining.

Muscle Man: (Sighs) Creepy.

Huggstable #3: (points at a troll) Oh no, more trouble.

All: Huggstables hug!

(They run up to the terrified troll and hug him turn him into a glitter too as they started to laugh and so as the baby)

Muscle Man: Why won't they stop hugging people?!

(Muscle Man looks at Tina started to laugh happily then turns around a little paranoid)

Huggstable #4: Hug time!

(They hug on the man)

Man: Help me...

(They all laugh as Muscle Man is paranoid with his eyes winking)

Huggstable #1: Wanna hug?

(Muscle Man's eyes went in horror to hear the word as the flashback ends)

Muscle Man: I tried to turn it off, but every time I did the baby would start crying again. They played all eight seasons; two hundred and fifty seven episodes back to back. When Starla and her sister found me the next day, I was crying in a ball on the floor.

Mordecai: It sounds like that show messed you up pretty bad.

Benson: That must be what's causing your nightmares.

Muscle Man: How do I get them out of my head?

Skips: (Turns around at Pops) Eh, Pops, you still have that dream catcher I let you borrow when you were having those talking dog nightmares?

Pops: Yes! They ride bicycles now, but it's not as scary.

Skips: Good. I have a plan.

(We skip the scene to see Muscle Man asleep tied up on the stair banister as the guys are holding the giant dream catcher)

Skips: So when I give the word, tilt the dream catcher towards Muscle Man and it will draw out the nightmares.

Pops: How delightful! I usually miss this part because I'm asleep.

(Muscle Man starts to snore. In his dream he falls through a purple vortex and lands in a colorful playroom. Suddenly he hears the doorknob and looks to see a Huggstable open the door)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro!

Huggstable #1: Do you want a hug? (Turns around to call the others) Come on friends, let's give him a hug!

(Four more of them appeared and they all started laughing chasing him as the terrified Muscle Man runs)

Muscle Man: No! NO!

(As he tries to run for his life but too late one of the Huggstables hug behind him while the other hugs him on the leg as Muscle Man trips over while the rest of them are about to hug him)

Muscle Man: Get off me, you freaks!

(All of the Huggstables continuing to hug him as Muscle Man was buried in the hug. Meanwhile Muscle Man begins to dream and starts screeching in panic)

Skips: Now!

(As the guys lift the dream catcher, a bright pink light appears out of the dream catcher and shoots towards Muscle Man, causing all of the Huggstables to come out of his dream)

Rigby: It's working!

(As the beam continues to make them all come out, more of them are still coming out of Muscle Man as the dream catcher begins to full)

Skips: Why are there so many?!

Mordecai: Muscle Man watched eight seasons worth!

(As the unaccountable number of Hugstabbles begins filling up the beam, they start to pop out from the beam.)

Skips: There's too many of 'em!

(Skips look down to see one the Huggstables hug his leg and starts lift his leg and flew it away)

Huggstable #2: Weee!

(The dream catcher suddenly getting full the net went straight the wall and brakes the net and all the purple dream creatures hit the wall)

Skips: Uh-oh...

(All of the Huggstables begins to laugh as they are about to hug the park employees but the guys manages to fight them back while Skips runs away)

Huggstable #3: Hugs!

(Pops punches her while Rigby uses his chair and hits the three of them to save Thomas)

Rigby: Hug this! (Starts hitting them as Thomas escapes while the three Huggstables starts to hug a chair, Skips arrives with a gym bag and throws it to the floor with dream catcher weapons inside)

Skips: Grab a weapon!

(The guys pick up their weapons. Mordecai grabs the tennis racket dream catcher)

Mordecai: Cool.

(Mordecai runs towards the Huggstables and swings the racket dream catcher on the Huggstables, Benson uses a bowing arrow dream catcher fire at the Huggstables the dream catcher pops out of the arrow and sucks it inside)

Rigby: Skips, why do you have all this stuff?

Skips: Hey! When you're as old as me, you have some pretty crazy dreams.

(The two runs around in the living room about to fire their weapons trapping the Huggstables, Pops with his dream catcher gun fires at the two Huggstables, High Five Ghost with the dream catcher mirror trap two Huggstables while Skips runs yelling, a Huggstable hug Benson Thomas with his straw that blows the dream catcher at the Huggstable saving Benson, Later Mordecai was swing the racket trapping one Huggstable as he tries to trap another one the dream catcher pounce the Huggstable)

Mordecai: Shoot, it's full!

Five Huggstables: (Running towards Mordecai) Hugs, Hugs, Hugs, Hugs, Hugs, Hugs!

(A giant dream catcher net appears out of nowhere trapping five of them, which turns out to be Pops laughing and blows the gun, Suddenly one of the Huggstable appears in front of him and hug him on the floor)

(The dreams catcher finally trap the last one)

Rigby: Did we get them all?

(Suddenly they heard a stomping noise they turned around to see a shadowy figure which revealed to be a giant pink Huggstable)

Huggstable Leader: Want a hug?

(Rigby fires the small dream catcher tries to trap it, but it has no effect)

Mordecai: We're out of dream catchers!

Skips: No. There's still one left.

(The scene cuts to the guys in Skips' van as the Huggstable Leader crash through the house)

Mordecai: Skips, this dream catcher is way too small!

Skips: I wasn't talking about that dream catcher.

(As the van starts continuing charging toward the leader, the camera cuts to see the skateboard ramp still there)

Benson: Ugh, I told you guys to put that ramp away!

Skips: You're gonna be glad they didn't. Hang on!

(Skips pulls the brake and accelerates the van towards the ramp and flew in the air revealing that the last dream catcher is under the van and landed on the leader trapped her inside the dream catcher as the van swirls and crashes into the broken wall)

Muscle Man: (Wakes up) Uh...Wha.. (The guys comes out of the van as Benson and Thomas untied the ropes freeing him)

Muscle Man: I had the weirdest dream. (To H.F.G.) You were in it, (To Benson) and you were in it. (To Thomas) You weren't, Thomas.

Mordecai: Sounds like you're cured.

Muscle Man: You got those things out of my head? I really owe you guys, big time.

Benson: Don't mention it. Now let's all go get some sleep.

Pops: But before we do, group hug?

Mordecai: Uh... No thanks Pops.

(Episode Ends)

(The episode started at the Coffee Shop, where Eileen was giving Mordecai and Rigby bags of their breakfast.)

Eileen: Here you go, two breakfasts to go. I put extra syrup in your sausage scrambler wrap, Rigby, just the way you like it.

Rigby: Sweet meat! (rubs his stomach) Aww, yeah!

Eileen: So what do you guys have planned for your day off?

Rigby: Hmm! Hmm! Two words, six syllables.

Mordecai and Rigby: Snow Tu-Tu-Tu-Tubing!

BOTH: Surprise!

What are you guys doing here at 6:00 in the morning?

TOGETHER:

TOGETHER:

Mordecai: Oh, man, remember last year when we talked Thomas into going down that double black...

(?)

Hm-hm! There's only one way out of this:

(?)

(Episode begins at Space Tree Station. A target is shot at three times in the Shooting Range room by Rigby.)

Rigby: Ooooh! Time to kick this up a notch. (Sets the level of his laser gun to Master Blaster.)

Mordecai: Dude, you can't shoot at maximum power. Your little body can't handle it.

Rigby: You don't know what my body is capable of!

(Rigby shoots at the target, causing the shot to bounce everywhere, including cutting off a man's hairdo, leaving a hole on a man's donut, which he eats, it bounces through Colonel Rawl's office and is about to head towards the Canadian Domers' room)

Canadian 1: Hey those new curtains really tie the room together eh?

Canadian 2: Yeah eh you want more maple syrup for your pan cakes eh?

(Rigby's shot goes into the room and burns their curtain, causing the sprinklers to go off)

Canadians: Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, eh!

(The duo look at each other. The scene then cuts to Rigby in Colonel Rawls' office)

Colonel Rawls: The Canadians?! Of all people they're the most pleasant group on the entire Space Tree!

Rigby: I said I was sorry.

Colonel Rawls: You're a loose cannon Rigby and I won't tolerate your unsafe behaviour anymore!

Rigby: Unsafe?! I'm totally... (knocks off Colonel Rawls' coffee mug, causing it to spill on Colonel Rawls' keyboard and computer, knocking down the light repair man and his ladder) ...safe?

Colonel Rawls: I'm putting you on probation, that means no more target practice, no outside privileges, and of course, no food trucks.

Rigby: (gasps in shock) But tomorrows Roxys famous fry truck, her butt salt is delicious!

Colonel Rawls: Guess its no butt salt for you.

Rigby: Can't you just let me slide just this once?

Colonel Rawls: Hmm, if you pass the Space Tree safety test I'll let you off the hook, but I suggest you start studying now. This thing's dryer than a bowl of pretzels on dust planet 9. (Grabs a big safety manual and places on his desk)

Rigby: Come on, Rawls. I just graduated high school. I am not going to read that thing.

Colonel Rawls: Well there is another way for those less literate.

Rigby: Name it.

Colonel Rawls: Perkins, awaken Spacey McSpaceTree.

(Perkins grabs a key, unlocks it and hits a button, which awakens Spacey McSpaceTree, then Spacey comes in.)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Hey, everybody!

Colonel Rawls: (chuckles) Hello, Spacey, it's been a while.

Rigby: Who is this guy?

Colonel Rawls: Rigby, this is Spacey McSpaceTree, our beloved mascot, he's been put in cryo-sleep for the last 30 years.

Rigby: Pssht. That costume sure looks like it's from 30 years ago.

Spacey McSpaceTree: Costume?

Colonel Rawls: Hey, show him some respect! He's going to stick with you until you pass the test.

Spacey McSpaceTree: That's right you can't be Safey McSafety without Spacey McSpaceTree. It's nice to wake up to a new friend. Put 'er there, Rigby. (They both shake) Woah, woah there! That's a very unsafe handshake you got there. We're gonna have to work on that.

(Rigby grumbles. The Space Tree safety test begins)

Spacey McSpaceTree: So, in conclusion, the seatbelt goes over the waist. Do you need another demonstration?

Rigby: Augh! I got it! You already showed me, like, five times.

(Sips his space soda and puts it on an edge of his desk)

Spacey McSpaceTree: AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!! AAH!! Pump the brakes there, amigo! That's a safety violation waiting to happen!

Rigby: I was just putting it down, I wasn't gonna spill it.

Spacey McSpaceTree: Okay, picture this: see you walking around, minding your own business, then BAM! (Knocks the space soda off the table) You knock it into the table!

(The space soda breaks on the floor and spills)

Rigby: Aw, come on!

Spacey McSpaceTree: Then, next thing you know. (Slips on the soda, slides and hits the door) Whoop! You end up hurting yourself. Or worse. (Slips on the soda and slides until he hits the wall) You end up in the hospital.

Rigby: Augh! You did that on purpose. That would never happen in real life.

Benson: (comes in) Hey, what's all the commotion in here? (Slips on the soda and slides until he hits Spacey)

Pops: (comes in with his tea set) Oh, Benson! (Slips on the soda and slides until he hits Benson and Spacey, breaking his tea set) Bad show!

Spacey McSpaceTree: See?!

(Circle-wipe transition to Muscle Man and Skips in a weight room with Skips struggling to lift weights)

Muscle Man: Come in, bro, dig deep!

(Skips keeps struggling until he finally lifts a weight until they float, revealing that it's zero gravity going off with a button pushed by Mordecai)

Mordecai: (giggles) Zero G.

(They laugh while they have fun in the zero gravity room)

Rigby: Aw, I wanted to pretend I could life heavy stuff. Stupid probation.

Spacey McSpaceTree: They're not even wearing helmets in there! Uno momento, Rig-bud!

(He goes into the room and floats near the button)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Hey, guys. Having a good time? Whoops! (Hits the zero gravity button, turning the room back on and injuring Mordecai, Muscle Man and Skips with the weights) Still look fun to you?! (One weight hits him on the helmet and he falls)

(Scene cuts time the cafeteria where Rigby's friends look injured)

Mordecai: Dude, what's wrong with your new friend?

Rigby: He's not my friend! He's just teaching me about safety so I can get off probation.

Skips: Why didn't you just read the safety manual?

Muscle Man: Yeah, bro, it's a pretty informative read.

Rigby: Well, I wish I knew that before I got stuck with this crazy tree guy following me around and judging my every move! (Slams his tray on the table)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Rigby, that's a safety violation! Did you know that seven out of ten lunchtime injuries are directly relating to tray-slamming? This could have been you!

(He grabs Rigby's tray and slams it on the opposite side, splashing the food all over the gang, including the Canadian Domers)

Canadians: Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry! I'm sorry.

Rigby: Spacey, what's your problem?!

Spacey McSpaceTree: Hey, I'm just watching your back, buddy. I still gotta teach you about safety with music.

(He puts a tape in a boombox as a montage begins with Spacey teaching Rigby about safety including the following: Rigby opens an oven that cooks a pizza, then he is about to grab it when Spacey moves him out of the way and shows him a demonstration by touching the pizza, causing him to be caught on fire as he stops, drops and rolls on the ground, then he gives Rigby oven mitts with Rigby looking at the pizza with Spacey's handprint on it. We are then shown to Spacey and Rigby on a field where Spacey making the letter "S" with his arms while Rigby is wearing the oven mitts. We cut to the Virtual Simulation room where Rigby is in, wearing a virtual reality helmet as a space quake initiates and he's shaking, but Spacey grabs the helmet, pushes Rigby out of the way and shows him another demonstration by taking cover underneath a table, thus breaking the helmet and gives it back to Rigby. We are then shown to Spacey and Rigby once again on the field where Spacey making the letter "S" with his arms again while Rigby holds his broken helmet. We cut to the park gang's bunker where Rigby lays down on his trampoline, but Spacey appears and gives another demonstration of how clothes will blind him by grabbing a pair of pants and blinding himself, thus Rigby leaves with a pillow. We are then shown to Spacey and Rigby on the field where Spacey making the letter "S" with his arms with a dancing jester dwarf while Rigby is wearing the oven mitts again. Cut to Rigby driving a space cart with Mordecai, looking horrible as the montage ends.)

Rigby: Safe... Safey McSafety... (snores)

Mordecai: Dude, turn, turn!

(Rigby quickly wakes up and turns the space cart, avoiding a huge box of dynamite)

Rigby: Gotta be safe! If Im not safe, he'll show up!

Mordecai: Dude, are you alright? You look horrible.

Rigby: It's Spacey! I gotta get him off my back once and for all!

Mordecai: Yeah, you gotta pass that test. I can't take much more of that guy.

Rigby: Don't worry. I have a plan. Take the wheel!

Mordecai: Wait, where are you going?!

(Rigby bails out of the space cart)

Mordecai: Arent you on proba... (Screams as he sees a dummy of Rigby in his stead)

(Cut to Rigby and Colonel Rawls in a test room)

Colonel Rawls: So Spacey says youre ready for this?

Rigby: Look, I even have written permission. (Shows him a tiny piece of paper that says "Rigby reddy 2 test spacee)

Colonel Rawls: Hmm. Looks like 30 years of cryosleep did a number on his penmanship, but if Spacey says youre ready, youre ready. This is our testing overlook machine, or as we like to call it T.O.M. It's proficient in all forms of safety protocol. Hello, T.O.M., this is Rigby.

T.O.M.: Hello, Rigby. I look forward to grading your test.

(T.O.M. prints out a future-looking test)

Rigby: Woah. This is a test? Does it come with a crazy pencil or something?

Colonel Rawls: No, there's no pencil. Just call out your answer and it will fill in automatically. Once it's complete, insert it into T.O.M. Good luck! (leaves)

(Cut back to Mordecai still taking the wheel in the space cart)

Mordecai: Augh! How long does he want me to do this? Huh?

(He sees Spacey in a police-like space cart in a side mirror as Spacey signals Mordecai to pull over, which he does and Spacey comes to the space cart)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Rigby, old buddy, old, pal. Couldn't help at notice you were driving a little irratically back there. That's not very (sees the Rigby dummy) SAFE?!?!

Mordecai: Uh... woah!

(Spacey grabs Mordecai by the chest)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Where is he?! Where's Rigby?!

Mordecai: Dude, I don't know, I don't know!

(Spacey lets go of Mordecai and leaves to look for Rigby)

Spacey McSpaceTree: RIGBY!!!!!

(Cut back to Rigby in the testing room where he is taking the test)

Rigby: Okay, question 17. B. (The test fills up the answer) Alright, question 18.

Spacey McSpaceTree: I'm coming, buddy!

(He drives up fast and a Canadian Domer jumps out of the way)

Spacey McSpaceTree: (to the Canadian Domer) Look both ways! You're not being safe!

Canadian: I'm sorry!

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. This is easier than I thought. C! (The test fills up the answer) Goodbye, Spacey and goodbye, probation.

Spacey McSpaceTree: RIGBY!!!! YOU'RE NOT READY!!!!

Rigby: Uh-oh. A, B, D, A, B, B, B! (The test fills up his answers. Spacey runs towards Rigby while he runs with the test and is about to put it into T.O.M., but Spacey grabs the test and he and Rigby are struggling for it) Let go!

Spacey McSpaceTree: No! You still have so much to learn!

Rigby: No! I'm threw with you!

(Rigby grabs the test and struggles to put into T.O.M.)

Spacey McSpaceTree: No!

(He bumps into Rigby as the test gets put in and T.O.M. is scanning the results)

Rigby: Yes!

(T.O.M. shows an error)

T.O.M.: Error. Test malfunction.

(As Rigby and Spacey take cover, T.O.M. turns evil, floats and grows tentacles of four unanswered questions with the test in the middle of his body)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Now, look what youve done!

Rigby: Me?! It was you! YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE!

(T.O.M. attacks Rigby and Spacey, but they duck)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Ruining your life? I thought we were bros. You're the first friend Ive had in 30 years. (On the verge of tears) Don't make like a tree and leave me.

(T.O.M. breathes fire as Rigby and Spacey jump, but the fire catches Spacey in the rump)

Rigby: Spacey!

Spacey McSpaceTree: AAAAH!! WHAT DO I DO?! WHAT DO I DO?!?!

Rigby: Quick, stop, drop and roll!

(Spacey rolls to put out the fire, as the first question is correct and loses T.O.M.'s left tentacle)

Rigby: The test! I still gotta finish it!

Spacey McSpaceTree: Wh-what?! Us against that?! That's totally unsafe!

Rigby: Hey, sometimes you gotta be unsafe to be safe.

(T.O.M. grabs Rigby)

Rigby: Quick, grab the test and read me the questions!

Spacey McSpaceTree: Which ones did you leave blank?

Rigby: 27, 44 and 83.

(Spacey goes through the test guide)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Okay, question 27: What do you do during a space quake?

(Rigby drops from T.O.M.'s grasp and runs under a table)

Rigby: I know this. Oh, Duck and cover underneath the table!

(T.O.M. is about to grab Rigby again as the question 27 is correct and his right tentacle)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Nice one! Okay, next question: Where are you permitted to use Space Tree laser guns?

Rigby: Only in designated shooting areas! Aah! Or, if under attack, of course!

(T.O.M. pins Rigby as question 44 is correct as Rigby grabs his tentacle and and lands on top of T.O.M.)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Okay, last question: what should you never do with space soda?

(T.O.M. is shaking to get Rigby off of him)

Rigby: What are my options?!

Spacey McSpaceTree: A: Drink while operating heavy machinery, B: Put it on an edge of a table, C: Drink more than two bottles a day!

(T.O.M. is still shaking to get Rigby off of him)

Spacey McSpaceTree: Come on, Rigby! We went over this!

(T.O.M. grabs Rigby and pins him up the ceiling)

Rigby: D: All of the above!

(With the last question correct, T.O.M. loses his last tentacle as Rigby falls and T.O.M. turns back to normal)

T.O.M.: Safety test complete. Processing results. Congratulations. You pass.

(Circle-wipe transitions to the gang and the Canadian Domers in Colonel Rawls' office where they celebrate Rigby's congratulation party for completing the safety test with Rigby wearing a medal that says "I'm Safe!")

Rigby: Thanks guys. Hey I worked out.

Muscle Man: (offscreen) I never thought he could.

Rigby: Thanks for helping me out, Spacey.

Spacey McSpaceTree: No problem. Sorry for being so clingy. If I learned anything, its that being too attached is emotionally unsafe. Here. (Takes off his helmet and waves his long hair) You keep that safe for me.

Rigby: You got it, friend. (Puts on the helmet)

Mordecai: Care for more Roxy's food truck fries, Rigby? Or should I say, Safey McSafety (chuckles)

Rigby: (gasps as he sees Muscle Man's space soda on the edge of a table) Safety violation!

Muscle Man: Come on, bro! I'm not gonna spill it! (knocks his space soda off the table) Oops.

(The space soda breaks and spills on the floor as Benson and Pops enter Rawls' office with Pops' tea set)

Pops: Tea time!

(They slip, slide at the gang and the Canadian Domers and they land on Rawls' desk as the light repair man falls again and lands on the table, sending the fruit punch bowl flying as it lands on the jester, causing him to back up into an escape pod and flies off into space. Fire breaks out, causing the sprinklers to go off)

Spacey McSpaceTree: I'm going back to cryo-sleep. (leaves)

(End of Spacey McSpaceTree)

(Episode begins at the Duty Free Shop. Mordecai and Rigby are  checking the 'VHS Rentals' section.)

Mordecai: Hmm. Man space is cool and all, but the VHS selection sucks

(Episode starts with the Space Tree Station cadets about to be graduated. We see the park crew doing some tasks, with Skips and Eileen on maintenence, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost cooking, and Benson piloting the dome.)

Colonel Rawls (voiceover): A few months ago, you folks were scrawny, weak, confused, drifting aimlessly in space-- utterly useless, until the Space Tree graciously took you in. Was it a mistake? Only time will tell. And now those worthless, scrawny cadets stand before me as moderately serviceable Space Tree Rangers! And today, you'll graduate the Spark Initiative and soon by on your way to terraform your first planet. I've already sent the coordinates into your dome's navigational computer, along with your personal fighter ships! 

(Mordecai and Rigby do stunts in their fighter ships.) 

Rawls: Today... is graduation day! There will be a ceremony tonight with light refreshments, compliments of the Space Tree. Hope to see you there! 

(The cadets cheer, the park crew included.) 

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOOOOOOA! Graduation! 

Rigby: Wow, one minute I'm graduating high school, and now I'm graduating space? Take that, Dad! 

Mordecai: Hm-hm! I don't think "light refreshments" are gonna cut it. 

Both: Comet Stop!

(At Comet Stop, the duo decide on what snacks to buy for the ceremony.) 

Rigby: Dude, should we get Moon Cheddar and Onion or Milky Way Mesquite Barbeque? 

Mordecai: What about Super Nova Nacho?

Rigby: Eh, I'll just get 'em all. (he picks up all the Super Nova Nacho bags) It's not a party until you have chips that taste like three different things!

Voice: Come on, man! Hurry up with the change! (Mordecai and Rigby peek over the aisle and see an armored soldier talking to the cashier.) 

Cashier: Sorry, bro. My boss makes me count back all the change. 

Soldier: Well, my boss will freak out if we're late for the attack on the Space Tree, so hurry up! 

(Mordecai and Rigby gasp. Just then, a strange figure with a huge head like Pops' approaches the door and melts it down. He ominously floats to the cash register while Mordecai and Rigby watch on with wide eyes. 

Soldier: (gasps) Sir! 

Ominous Figure: What's taking so long? 

Soldier: I-I got your Cherry Space Splushee just as you requested, but this guy is taking too long to give me my change! 

(The figure takes a sip from the splushee and smacks his lips) 

Ominous Figure: Keep the change. (he chuckles evilly and waves his hand, making the panicked cashier flicker away into whiteness. With horrified faces, Mordecai and Rigby run out of the store.) Bad show. Jolly bad show! Ahahahahaha! 

(Back at the Space Tree) 

Mordecai: And he looked just like Pops! But evil! 

Rigby: Yeah, like an opposite Pops! 

Both: Anti-Pops! 

Mordecai: Jinx. 

Rawls: (gasps) He Who Will Erase Us... (He turns on a microphone.) Attention, Space Tree! This is your captain speaking! There's been a change of plans! You're all graduated, effective immediately! Congrats! Your first mission as Rangers starts now! Leave the Space Tree and get to your rendezvous points as soon as possible! Godspeed and good luck! 

Space Tree Personnel: Sir! An unknown ship just docked with the Space Tree! 

Rawls: We're too late... 

(An alarm blares. Four figures breach the Space Tree: a robot with a blaster, an ape-like alien, a lizard-like creature, and a humanoid holding a laser rifle and an eyepiece. Armored soldiers similar to the one seen at Comet Stop capture all of the Space Tree personnel and cadets. Outside the Space Tree, a large, sinister spaceship is attached to the Space Tree with smaller ships surrounding it. Someone tries to break through a door, but Rawls runs up to it and tries to hold them back.)  

Rawls: (growls in effort) Protect Pops! Make sure he gets off the Space Tree! (At his words, the park crew is confused.)  

Pops: Why me?  

Rawls: No time to explain, just go!  

Skips: (Moves a vent aside) Everybody, come on! (Everyone climbs inside the air duct and runs off just before the door is blown open,)  

Rawls: No! (he screams as he is thrown to the floor. The ominous figure from Comet Stop- Anti-Pops- arrives with soldiers in tow. Meanwhile, the park crew runs through the air duct.)  

High Five Ghost: I'm so confused! What's going on?!  

Muscle Man: Yeah, why's Pops so special? 

Pops: Oh, I didn't ask for this! Why does everyone on the Space Tree have to suffer on my account? 

Benson: We'll figure it out later, Pops. Let's just do what Rawls said and get you out of here! There's a ship in the hangar we can take. 

(In the Space Tree's food court, everyone onboard, including Spacey McSpaceTree, is rounded up as hostages and Anti-Pops is telekinetically holding Rawls in the air.) 

Soldier: Sorry, sir. There's no sign of Pops anywhere. 

Anti-Pops: Where is he? 

Rawls: I told you, I don't know! (Anti-Pops clenches his hands into fists and pulls them inward, causing Rawls to scream in pain.) AAAAARGH! ALL RIGHT! He... he's on his way!  

Anti-Pops: (releases Rawls) You lie. 

Rawls: No, no! He'll be here in two minutes! That's like... a thousand push-ups! 

Anti-Pops: (scoffs) A thousand push-ups in two minutes? Impossible! 

Rawls: Watch me. (he starts doing push-ups at a fast rate before quickly switching to different variations.) One, two, three, four, five, one-handed! Clapping! Double-clapping! Fingertips! Fingertip! Aztec push-ups! Triple dip push-ups! Toe-toe-toe push-ups! Riding push-ups!

Soldier: Should I take him out, sir? 

Anti-Pops: No, no. I want to see how this ends... 

(Meanwhile, the park crew reaches the hangar. Skips looks through a grate.) 

Skips: There's the ship, and it's not alone. (Down by the ship, the four minions from earlier are guarding it.) 

Ape Alien: This is so boring! 

Humanoid Alien: Oh, hush up! Keep an eye out for the one with the big head! 

(A Super Nova Nacho bag falls to the floor, alerting the reptilian alien. He picks it up and shows it to the others, speaking in a lizard-like language.) 

Droid: Wow, is that Super Nova Nacho? (Irritated, the ape alien snatches the bag.) 

Ape Alien: You holding out on us, Jeff? (The lizard-like alien- Jeff- tries to deny it and waves his arms.) C'mon, Jeff. You know we don't speak Lizarkian. (He opens the bag and tries to eat a chip, but the grate falls on top of all four of them. Skips moves the unconscious minions while everyone else tries to board the ship.) 

Mordecai: Come on! Let's get out of here! 

Pops: I'm not going!

Benson: Come on, Pops! We gotta go! 

Pops: We can't just abandon everyone! I'm going back to save them! It's what a real Space Tree Ranger would do! (Mordecai and Rigby see helium tanks and a balloon nearby that reads "Happy Graduation".)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm-hm-hm!  

Mordecai: I've got an idea. 

(Back at the food court, Rawls continues to distract Anti-Pops with push-ups.) 

Rawls: Barrel roll! Toe touch! Somersault! 

Anti-Pops: Grrr! ENOUGH! (He sprays white lightning into the air and turns to the cadets with a ball of lightning in his hand.) If someone doesn't bring me Pops right now, you can say farewell to your Space Tree AND YOURSELVES! 

Soldier: Sir, look! (Outside, a ship flies away from the Space Tree.) 

Rawls: (exhausted and chuckling) You're too late. 

Anti-Pops: Guards! Get to your ships! We cannot lose them! (he boards a small ship with some of his men and catches up to the escaping ship. His entire fleet departs from the Space Tree to pursue. Anti-Pops boards the ship and sees a huge circle in the chair. He turns the chair around... and sees that it is a graduation balloon tied to a brick. The balloon has been spray-painted to read "Happy Graduation, Suckerz".) UUUUAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHH! 

(Meanwhile, the park crew is back with Rawls.)

Rawls: I told you to get Pops off the Space Tree! 

Pops: We couldn't leave you behind! It's not the Space Tree Ranger way.

Rawls: Hmm. That's very noble of you, Pops. Stupid, but noble. You're a true Ranger. It's a shame we have to cut the graduation short, but you have no idea what danger lies ahead of you. (to the cadets) Everybody, we don't have much time! Get to your domes and warp out of here as fast as you can! 

(Everyone runs for the dome room to take off. Chance Sureshot, Toothpick Sally, and Recap Robot join the park crew.) 

Sureshot: Follow us! (They run down a hallway, only for a soldier to block their path.) 

Sally: There's a guard ahead! 

Sureshot: Don't worry, I got this! (He aims and shoots at the soldier, who notices and dodges the shot. Sureshot's laser ricochets down the hall. With a groan, Sally flings her toothpick at the guard, which explodes and takes him out.) 

Sally: Keep running! (Most of the cadets reach their domes and take off, flying away from the Space Tree. Still on board the shuttle, Anti-Pops grow furious at the sight of the escaping domes, knowing Pops could be on any one of them.) 

Anti-Pops: No, no, no, no, no, NO! (two ships fly by with two of his minions inside each one. He contacts the one piloted by the humanoid alien.) 

Humanoid Alien: What should we do now, sir? 

Anti-Pops (on hologram): Destroy them all! But leave Pops to me.

(Back in the Space Tree, the park crew is almost at the dome hangar, but the door begins to slide shut.) 

Mordecai: (gasps) The dome room door is closing! 

Rawls: Not on my watch! (He runs underneath the door and holds it up in a push-up pose.) Cadets, move! (Everyone runs into the dome room, but stop.) 

Benson: Come on, Rawls! Let's get out of here! 

Rawls: You guys go! I'm staying here! 

Rigby: Rawls, no! 

Rawls: Just go! (The park crew head to the dome, take off, and leave. Rawls gives them a salute before succumbing to the weight of the door.) Hoo-yah! Oh! 

(In space, Anti-Pops' ships are attacking the domes. The Park Dome flies around other domes, hostile ships, and explosions. Aboard the bridge, Eileen calculates a jump to warp speed.) 

Computer: Warp drive activated. One minute and counting. 

Benson: Sureshot, give us your status! 

Sureshot: We're right behind you, Benson! 

(Sureshot's ship flies close behind the Park Dome. The minions' ships fly overhead.) 

Jeff (in Lizarkian): No way out now, Pops! (The minions perform an attack run, peppering the dome with laser fire. Everyone is flung to the side.) 

Sally: Benson, warp out of here now! We'll hold them off!

Recap Robot: Brace yourselves! (Sureshot's ship flies towards the ship piloted by Jeff and the droid. It fires a green laser, sending the minions' ship flying out of control. The humanoid alien grunts and flies after Sureshot.) 

Humanoid Alien: Aah! Who are these guys?! (He slams his ship into Sureshot's.) 

Benson: Sureshot, what happened? Sureshot?! 

Sureshot (over comms): Need... backup! (His end is now nothing but static.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm-hm-hm! 

Mordecai: We got this. (Their seats lean back and they are sucked into tubes that send them to their fighter ships. Mordecai lands perfectly while Rigby botches his landing. Meanwhile, the last minion ship is still attacking Sureshot.) 

Recap: I can't shake 'em! (The minions laugh before a laser shoots past their ship.) 

Humanoid Alien: What the-?! (Rigby is behind them and continues to shoot.)  

Rigby: How about some of this?! Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm! (He hambones, shoots at the minions some more, and flies ahead of them.) 

Ape Alien: Let's take that dweeb out! (The minions chase after Rigby and shoot at him. A panicked Rigby tries to shake them off, but can't.) 

Rigby: Mordecai, help! (the minions laugh again as the lock on to Rigby's ship. Before they can fire, Mordecai comes in from behind them and blasts a laser at their ship, taking them out of the action.) 

Mordecai: In yo face! (He and Rigby loops their ships back around.) 

Both: WHOOOOOOOA! (They are cut off by the sight of Anti-Pops' main flagship, which dwarfs their own fighters easily. It blocks the dome's path and Anti-Pops laughs aboard the bridge.) 

Anti-Pops: This ends now! (A giant cannon comes out of the ship with a soldier at the controls. He targets the Park Dome and Eileen's screen flashes a warning.) 

Eileen: They've locked onto the dome with a tractor beam! (The Park Dome is pulled closer to Anti-Pops' ship, its main cannon charging up.) 

Skips: Warp us, Benson! 

Benson: (he mashes his control panel) I can't! The controls are disabled! (The cannon continues to charge. Sureshot's ship flies up to Mordecai and Rigby's fighters.) 

Sureshot: You two head back to the dome! We'll take it from here! 

Rigby: No, we're not leaving you! 

Sureshot: Just do it! We'll meet up with you guys later! 

Mordecai: But you could die! 

Sureshot: (dramatically whips his hair) Hey, there's nothing more sure... than death. 

Sally: Ugh, don't be so dramatic. We'll disable the tractor beam! Mordecai, Rigby, just go! 

(Mordecai and Rigby reluctantly fly back to the Park Dome.) 

Computer: Thirty seconds to warp speed. (Mordecai and Rigby land and join the others on the bridge as an alarm blares. The cannon finishes charging up.) 

Anti-Pops: So long, Pops. (Sureshot, Sally, and Recap approach the cannon. Sally squeezes the triggers, but a display comes up.) 

Computer: Ship ammo depleted. 

Sally: We're out of ammo! 

Sureshot: I'm not out of ammo! (He holds up his blaster.) 

Sally: Yeah, but with your aim, you don't have a chance, Sureshot! 

Sureshot: That's my name. Don't wear it out. (He presses the eject button and is launched into space.) 

Benson: Sureshot! NOOO! 

(In the vacuum of space, Sureshot points his blaster and fires. His shot hits the soldier operating the cannon in the chest. The soldier's head lands on his controls and the cannon aims upward just as it fires. The shot obliterates a nearby planet to space dust. Just before he is consumed by the explosion, Sureshot gives a thumbs-up. The park crew watch in horror while the countdown finishes.) 

Computer: Warp speed engaged. 

(The Park Dome turns around and blasts off at warp speed.)

(The episode begins with Thomas driving car to the park as  "Toast of the Town" by Mötley Crüe starts to play. He greets everyone and starts going through a series of initiation week pranks.)

Benson: Alright Thomas, youve made it through initiation week. Welcome to the park.

(The next day. Mordecai, Rigby, Thomas, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are at Pops's House.)

Thomas: Hey guys.

Rigby: Hey Thomas.

Mordecai: 'Sup dude.

Muscle Man: Yo Thomas! Saved you a seat right next to me, bro.

Thomas: Oh, thanks Muscle Man! 

(
Thomas crashes through the floor board)

Muscle Man: (Laughing) The loose floorboard gag, they fall for it every time. Get it? Fall for it. Ha ha. What do you think of that, starter pack?

Thomas: (Laughing) Dude, thats so lame. That joke really fell flat. You get it? It really fell-flat. Get it? Fell--
(Muscle Man
laughs) 

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man, Thomas initiation is over.

Rigby: You cant prank him anymore.

Muscle Man: Its not over till I say its over, ladies. As far as Im concerned, his initiation has just begun. Right, Starter Pack? 

(He farts near Thomas' face.)

Thomas: Oh, man! Dude, thats sick! My mouth was open! 
(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost exit laughing)

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta stop Muscle Man from pranking Thomas. 

(Later, Mordecai and Rigby meet up with Thomas.)

Mordecai: Hey Thomas, hows it going? Is everything cool? 

Thomas: Pretty good, pretty good.

Rigby: Muscle Man's not pranking you anymore, is he?

Thomas: Nah. Hes been really cool. He said I could drive the cart later.

Muscle Man: Hey Thomas, heads up. 

(He throws him a soda.)

Thomas: Wow, hey, thanks man.

(The soda explodes in his face.)

Thomas: Nice try, Muscle Man, but I still got a free soda.

Mordecai and Rigby: Ahh! 

Muscle Man: (laughs) And now youve got a free starter pack stash. 

(Thomas laughs.)

Mordecai: Ahhh, enough with the pranks, it's getting old, dude.

Muscle Man: Chill out, bro. Learn how to take a joke like my buddy Thomas. 

Thomas: Yeah, its not like Ill be an intern forever.

Muscle Man: See you later, losers! 

(He pins a Kick Me" sign to Thomas.)

Muscle Man and Thomas: Woooooo!

(Muscle Man and Thomas drive off
. Scene shifts to Skips house)

Mordecai: Skips, there is something weve got to ask you.

Skips: Let me guess, you want Muscle Man to stop pranking Thomas?

Mordecai: Yeah. How did you know?

Skips: I can sense your compassion for him.

Mordecai: Muscle Man is just taking this initation thing way too far.

Rigby: Yeah, and no one is stopping him.

Skips: Guys, I know youre looking out for Thomas, but youve got to let him fight his own battles.

(Everyone sees Muscle Man pranking Thomas outside the window)

Muscle Man: Dude, take the wheel!

(He drives by Thomas and gives him a wedgie.)

Muscle Man (continued): Drive by atomic wedgie! Ha ha!

Skips: (Chuckles) What? It was funny. See, look, Thomas is okay with it.

Thomas: Aw dude, shouldve gone commando

(Scene cuts to Thomas eating lunch at the bench.  Mordecai and Rigby walk over to Thomas)


Mordecai: Hey, Thomas, can we talk to you?

Thomas: Hey guys, whats up?

Mordecai: Look, weve been watching Muscle Man prank you and it's gotten way out of hand. You can stop him, but you have to prank him back.

Thomas: Prank him back? I cant prank my superior.

Mordecai: Dont you get it? Muscle Man is taking advantage of you because you're new.

Rigby: Yeah, stick up for yourself man. Fight for your right!

Thomas: Fight? No, no. Look guys, I appreciate you guys looking out for me, there's no hard feelings. It's best to leave it alone. 

(Thomas leaves.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ahhhhh!

Rigby: Dont worry, I got an idea.

(We cut to Mordecai and Rigby with Benson in his office.)

Benson: So let me get this straight: you want me to stop Muscle Man from pranking Thomas, even though Thomas doesnt mind it?

Rigby: Yeah, basically.

Mordecai: Yes.

Benson: No, if Thomas is okay with it, then why interfere?

Mordecai: 'Cause, dude, he doesnt know what hes getting into.

Rigby: Being pranked by Muscle Man all the time is the worst! You dont know what its like, man.

Mordecai: Youve got to do something.

Benson: Ahhh! Alright, alright, Ill think of something.

(We cut downstairs in the living room.)

Benson: Thank you for coming, Muscle Man. Now because some employees have come forward with complaints-

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmph, hmph.

Benson: Im going to play this tape that reviews the parks policies on pranking. Watch it, Then get back to work.

Muscle Man: Sweet, a movie.

Narrator: Pranking: good times at the office just keep on rolling... when there's pranks around!

(A blonde office worker pulls his pants off. Muscle Man slaps his knee and laughs)

All:(Laughs) (Freeze Frame) (Ding)

Narrator: But what happens when pranking goes wrong? Let's watch Keith to find out.

Actor: Hey, Keith. (throws pie)

(A blonde office worker pulls Keith's pants off) <Keith continues to get hurt>

Keith: Hey, wait, I'm not- 

(A blonde office worker presses a button and throws Keith out)


Keith (continued): DEEEEEAAAA--


(Explodes)
All: (Laughs) (Freeze Frame) (Ding)

Narrator: We call this overpranking. Its when too much of a good thing goes bad.

Muscle Man: This movie is the best! I cant wait to try those pranks out! 

(He laughs.)

Muscle Man (continued):Thomas! Get me some popcorn!

Thomas: Coming!

(Thomas gets tripped by wire. Muscle Man laughs)

Mordecai: Dude, snack bar. Now.

(Scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby at the snack bar)

Rigby: Are you sure this is going to work?

Mordecai: Yeah man, it's totally going to work. All weve go to do is prank Muscle Man and tell him that Thomas did it. That way hell respect him for standing up for himself. And hell stop pranking him.

Rigby: Love it. Hope Muscle Man is ready to get trashed by Thomas. Hmph!

Mordecai: Hmph!

(Later, Muscle Man is with Mordecai and Rigby at the Snack Bar.)

Muscle Man: So why did you need me over here again? Because Thomas doesnt know how to do anything, right?

Mordecai: Yeah, Thomas said he had trouble shutting the lid. We thought you might be able to help so

Muscle Man: Well duh! This is obviously a job for a pro.

(Muscle Man closes the lid and has trash rain down on him. Mordecai and Rigby laugh)

Muscle Man: Aw, what the?

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh harder.)

Rigby: Thomas pranked you good, man!

Muscle Man: THOMAS did this?

Mordecai: Yeah, he also told us to tell you that you should think twice about pranking him again.

Muscle Man: THOMAS DID THIS?!

Rigby: Uh, Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: (Roars) He thinks he can prank his superior and get away with it?!

(He karate chops the dumpster.)

Muscle Man (continued): Hes going to wish he was never born. THOMAS!! 

(Muscle Man starts running off to find him, while creating a path of destruction. Mordecai and Rigby are shocked. They go and find Thomas, who is raking the leaves.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Thomas! Thomas!

Rigby: Thomas, youve got to get out of here, man.

Thomas: What?

Rigby: Muscle Man is looking for you and hes really mad at you.

Thomas: What are you talking about?

Mordecai: Well, we kind of dumped trash on him and said you did it.

(Muscle Man can be heard in the distance.)

Muscle Man: THOMAS!

(The guys run. They hide behind a giant boulder.)

Thomas: Cant we just talk to him?

(The boulders gets lifted up, and it's revealed to be Muscle Man. They scream at him.)

Mordecai: Run!

(Muscle Man hurls the boulder at the guys, and they scream as they dodge it. They are scrambling through the trees. They finally make it through, with Muscle Man stilll trailing behind.)

Muscle Man: Thomas?!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Thomas scream as he starts throwing trees at them. Muscle Man start squealing while waving two trrees in his hands. As the three continue running, he fails at throwing the trees toward them. He resumes squealing while chasing the three down to the parking lot.)

Mordecai: Come on, this way!

(They go in between two cars, while Muscle Man looks around before running in another direction. We pan down to the others, hiding in a different part of the parking lot.)

Thomas: Hey, my car!

(Thomas' car is parked next to a shed.)

Mordecai: Thomas, go! Muscle Man just needs time to cool off!

Thomas: But-

Mordecai: Just get out of here! GO!

(Thomas runs off to his car. Muscle Man lifts the car behind Mordecai and Rigby, them throws it aside. Mordecai and Rigby scream.)

Muscle Man: Wheres Thomas?!

(Muscle Man notices Thomas desperately trying to start his car.)

Muscle Man (continued) : Thomas.

(He starts charging toward him. Thomas screams in a high-pitched voice before backing out and driving off. Muscle Man grabs the shed in his hands. Mordecai and Rigby grab him by the shoulders.)

Mordecai: Muscle Man, dont!

(Muscle Man gets them out of the way, and start running toward the car.)

Rigby: Dude, weve got to tell him it was our fault.

Mordecai: Come on.

(Thomas drives out of the parking lot and on the road. Muscle Man stand out in the middle of the road with the shed.)

Muscle Man: Interns gotta learn not to prank their superiors.

(He lifts up the shed and starts spinning around on one foot. Mordecai and Rigby run out of the parking lot.)

Mordecai: Muscle Man! Thomas didnt prank you! 

(Muscle Man continues spinning and aquealing until he finally throws it.)

Mordecai (continued): (in slow motion) It was us!

(The shed gows up in the air and starts to come down. Muscle Man starts panting. The shed catches up to the car.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (in slow motion) Noooo!

(The shed crashes down on Thomas' car, flattening it, setting a spark and starts a fire.)

Rigby: Oh no, what did we do?!

Mordecai: We killed Thomas. Thomas was right, we should have left it alone. And now hes dead because of us.

(Muscle Man walks up to them.)

Muscle Man: Then maybe you should tell him you're sorry. Yo, Thomas!

(It's revealed Thomas was hiding in the bushes.)

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Thomas: Did it work? Did I do it right?

(Muscle Man shakes his hand.)

Muscle Man: Yeah, you did! Those losers totally bought it!

Mordecai: Wait, youre alive?!

Muscle Man: Yeah hes alive. And, hes a bonafide pranker. Congratulations, youre no longer a starter pack.

Thomas: Wow, thanks!

Rigby: Yeah, congratulations, Thomas.

Mordecai: I hope it was worth getting your car totaled.

Muscle Man: Dont worry Thomas, it just needs a little body work.

(Thomas' car explodes leaving the shed on fire. Muscle Man starts twirling his shirt.)

Muscle Man: Later, grandmas! 

(He runs off.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah, later, Thomas.

(Mordecai and Rigby leave. Thomas' phone rings)

Thomas: Oh hey Mom. Yeah, yeah, everything is going great Hey, can I borrow your car tomorrow? 


Rigby: Rufus passes to Blue, Bluey to Old Man Samson, Samson with a twirl and, OHHHHHHHH!

[Horn sounds, scoreboard is shown with Home: 3, Away: 3, Period: 3 and Time Remaining: 3:40]

Mordecai: Whoa, sweet shot! [laughs and presses start to release another puck]

Mordecai: OHHHHHHHH!

Rigby: Aww, man! Alright, you're going down. C'mon fellas, let's pick it up!

Benson: Hey! What the heck are you doing?

Rigby: Huh? [looks away from table]

Mordecai: [shoots a goal] WHHHHHOOOOAAAA!

[Horn sounds, scoreboard shows Home: 3, Away: 4, Period: 3, Time Remaining: 0:00]

Rigby: Aww, what? Benson distracted me, no fair!

Mordecai: (excitedly) Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Rigby: Alright, best out of fifteen.

Benson: Whoa, whoa, hold on a second. You guys are supposed to be working.

Mordecai: Yeah, I know but, c'mon check this out. We found crammed in the back behind all this junk.

Rigby: [rubbing against the table] Miniature man hockey dome.

Benson: It's called Stick Hockey. And it's mine.

Rigby: It's so much fun.

Mordecai: So much fun.

Rigby: So much fun.

Mordecai: So much fun.

Benson: Look I don't care how much fun you think you're having, you're supposed to de-gum the park today and now I find you holed up in here twiddling some sticks?

Mordecai: Ugh, don't say it like that.

Benson: I knew I should've gotten rid of that game. It's a waste of time.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Mordecai: Okay, okay, we'll go out right now and finish de-gumming. Please just don't get rid of the game!

Rigby: It's so much fun.

Mordecai: So much fun.

Benson: (defeatedly) Fine. [sighs] If you finish all your work on time you can keep the game.

Rigby: Yes!

Mordecai: All right!

Mordecai and Rigby: [run out of the garage] Thank you thank you thank you thank you.

Rigby: We did it! [raises arm]

Mordecai: See? Having a goal totally focused us!

Rigby: I get it now, work hard and then play hard!

Mordecai: And we're gonna be playing hard all night!

Rigby: (disgusted) Ugh, don't say it like that!

[Mordecai opens the garage door]

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Mordecai: Okay, Benson, where is it?

Benson: Where's what?

Mordecai: Our stick hockey table!

Benson: I got rid of it.

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what?!

Rigby: But you said we could have it!

Benson: Nice try, there's no way you two de-gummed the entire park.

Benson: Oof!

Mordecai: We kept our end of the deal so give it back.

Benson: Sorry, I already took it to the thrift store.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Rigby: [raises both arms in disbelief] Who does that?!

Benson: How was I supposed to know you'd actually finish your work for once?

Mordecai: You can't just say one thing and turn around and do another!

Benson: What are you talking about? You guys do that all the time!

Rigby: That's different, you're the boss!

Mordecai: How are we supposed to work for someone we can't trust?

Benson: Hey! Trust me, I did you guys a favor. That thing is a waste of time. Skips, back me up. [looks to Skips]

Skips: You shouldn't have thrown away the game, Benson.

Pops: I concur, one must be a man of his word.

Benson: [laughs disbelievingly] I can't believe this!

Mordecai: We want our game back.

Rigby: Yeah, man. You owe us!

Skips: You do owe 'em.

Benson: [sighs] Alright, let's go get it.

Employee: Yeah, yeah, the game with the sticks. Nah, it's gone. I sold it to Jeffy over at Thift World.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Employee: Yeah, it was in great condition. I don't know what someone would just donate it like that.

Mordecai: Yeah, they probably weren't thinking straight.

Employee: Wait, where's my head? I got another stick game in the back!

Mordecai and Rigby: Really?!

Employee: Yeah, right over there! [points left]

Rigby: Aww what?

Mordecai: No!

Benson: (with mock enthusiasm) Hey, great find, guys! This is great!

Rigby: It's not the same.

Benson: No, but some would say foosball's better. It's got the same wrist action, plus mass appeal. Way more people play soccer than hockey. C'mon, give it a shot!

Rigby: So what's this called again? Foolsball? Hm! [flicks a stick aggressively]

Mordecai: Aw!

Rigby: See!

Mordecai: Argh!

Benson: So we gettin' it?

Mordecai: I can't believe you tried to pawn off that junky foosball table on us.

Benson: Sorry, jeez! At least, it was pretty much brand new! That old stick hockey game was a piece of junk.

Mordecai: Oh, of course you'd think that.

Rigby: That piece of junk was the coolest thing in the whole park!

Benson: Sure, it's cool now, but keep playing it and one day, bam! Your lives are ruined.

Rigby: What are you talking about? It's just stick hockey. [raises arms in exasperation]

Benson: Could you just trust me on this one?

Mordecai: Alright, Benson, we trust you. Oh wait, now I'm taking the trust I said you could have and I'm throwin' it away instead.

Mordecai and Rigby: OHHHHHHHHH!

Benson: [stops the golf cart in a fury] This wouldn't have happened if you guys had done your job!

Rigby: No, no, no. You can't get mad this time. You messed up, not us!

Benson: Argh! Just listen to me!

Mordecai: You know what, Benson? Forget it. [shoves Benson off the cart] Thanks for all your help, but we can get the stick hockey table without you. [drives golf cart away]

Benson: What the heck?! How am I supposed to get back to the park?!

[Montage of Mordecai and Rigby narrowly missing the stick hockey table plays until they come to a steel door. The door opens and an arm gripping a stick flies out]

Mordecai: Uh, we're heard there was a stick hockey table here?

Pops: Benson! Care to join our game of cards?

Benson: Not now, Pops.

Pops: Suit yourself!

Skips: Where are Mordecai and Rigby?

Benson: How should I know?! They stole the cart and took off without me! Can you believe it?

Skips: After what you pulled? I believe it.

Benson: What?! You're still on their side?!

Skips: You should've at least given them a chance.

Pops: It seems the honorable thing to do is apologize. Oh, look! [holds up a joker card with Benson on it] This one is you! [giggles]

Benson: [sighs] Alright.

Skips: Hmph. [tosses a walkie talkie to Benson]

Benson: Mordecai, Rigby, are you there? Pick up!

Skips: [reaches for walkie talkie] Let me try. Mordecai, Rigby. Are you there?

Rigby: (over walkie talkie) Hey, Skips.

Benson: Tell them I want to talk to them! Tell them!

Skips: Where are you? [skips away] Where are you guys?

[Static]

Skips: Uh huh. Mmhm. Okay.

Benson: So what are they still mad at me? Where are they?

Skips: You're not gonna like it.

[Cut to Mordecai and Rigby versing Chong at stick hockey in an arena. The crowd is yelling. Chong hits with the visibly battered Mordecai and Rigby with a stick. Chong scores, the scoreboard showing Home: 7, Away: 32, Period: 3, Time Remaining: 2:58. The crowd cheer with Chong. They continue playing when Chong pushes Mordecai and Rigby to the ground with sticks]

Rigby: This is so not fun...

Mordecai: So not fun...

Rigby: I don't want him to chop off our heads!

Chong: [laughs] Who's going to finish your game now? [laughs]

Benson: I'll finish it! [walks onto arena]

Chong: [gasps] Death Dragon!

Flashback Benson: Well, looks like we're up. Just remember what I taught you.

Dave: Thank you, master.

Flashback Benson: I'll see you in the finals. [fist bumps with Dave]

Dave: Oh, my neck!

Flashback Benson: Dave!

Dave: Master, I thought you said this was gonna be so much fu- Guh... [dies]

Flashback Benson: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...

Chong: I always knew the dragon would return to his lair. [throws Mordecai and Rigby]

Benson: I go by Benson now.

Chong: Oooh, Benson.

Benson: I'm here to get my friends and go.

Chong: Who, these pathetic stick twiddlers?

Benson: Don't say it like that.

Chong: Get rid of them.

[men take Mordecai and Rigby away]

Benson: No!

Chong: What are you going to do about it?

Benson: I'm going to finish the game and beat you like I should have ten years ago.

Mordecai: No! Benson! Don't!

Rigby: Don't do it! This game is to the death!

Benson: Trust me.

Chong: I see you've retained some of your skills. Too bad the game has changed.

[Ground around the table sections off and elevates. Pit of fire starts. The section tilts towards Chong. Chong laughs. The section tilts towards Benson. Benson slips and hangs off the edge, then pulls himself up. Benson quickly scores. Chong gasps and surrounds Benson with copies of himself and the table. His score increases. Benson disillusions the copies and goes into overdrive, scoring rapidly. He breaks the table both of them fly onto the ground. The scoreboard shows Home: 48, Away: 47, Period: 7, Time Remaining: 0:00. Cut to the garage with Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and the stick hockey table]

Benson: There you go, good as new.

Mordecai: Thanks, Benson, we-

Benson: Ah, ah, before you say anything else, I want to apologize for getting rid of your game. I shouldn't have gone back on my word.

Mordecai: That's cool.

Benson: I guess I just didn't want to see you end up like me. Some dried-up loser stuck working at a park because he wasted his life playing stick hockey.

Rigby: Yeah, totally.

Benson: So what do you say, wanna play a round?

Mordecai: Ah, no, I think we're good. We should've trusted you, Benson.

Rigby: We're going back to video games.

Mordecai: Later.

Benson: [sighs] Why do I even bother?

(The episode starts with the guys in the forest, listening to Benson.)

Benson: Here you go, Thomas. Try that. (Hands him a glass)

Thomas: (Drinks) Amazing. It tastes just like water.

Benson: That's because it is water. 100% safe drinking water from the dew I collected this morning. You can last for months with just the knowledge I've shared today.

Pops: Bravo!

(Everybody claps)

Pops: Is it really pure dew?

Benson: Sure is. Here, let me show you my system.

(Everybody gets up and leaves except for Mordecai and Rigby, who are busy playing video games.)

Rigby: Can you guys keep it down? All this "pure dew" talk is blowing my fo- oomph!

Mordecai: Mmm!

(Rigby grunts as they play intensely. Mordecai soon wins, causing Rigby to groan.)

Mordecai: Haha, OOOOOOHHHHHH! Good game, dude, good game.

Benson: Guys! Can you come here for a second?

Mordecai: Aw sweet, Benson's presentation is over.

Rigby: Look out face, it's time to shove some burgers in your mouth!

Mordecai: Yeah, watch out buns, 'cause you're about to get some patties up in you. 

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh simultaneously and walk over to Benson.) 

Benson: Hey guys, thanks a lot for coming to this. I know my wilderness survival presentations aren't how you'd normally choose to spend your time off. 

Mordecai: Sure, Benson. No problem. 

Benson: Great. So, if you can just bring over the tortillas I'll get started on the food. 

Rigby: No offense, but you don't make burgers with tortillas. 

Benson: (Eyes narrowing) Wait. Are you telling me that you didn't bring the tortillas?

Rigby: Why would we bring tortillas for burgers?

Benson: Because we're not having burgers, we're having quesadillas.

Rigby: Ah, what?! We only came to this thing for the burgers at the end! 

Mordecai: Yeah, why didn't you tell us we were having quesadillas this time? 

Benson: I did tell you, over and over! I said we're having quesadillas this time! 

(Flashbacks to Mordecai and Rigby playing video games.)

Benson: Don't forget, we're havin' quesadillas this time, so, if you can pick up the tortillas I'd really appreciate it. 

Mordecai: (Distracted) No problem. 

(Flashbacks to Benson knocking on Mordecai and Rigby's bedroom door while Mordecai and Rigby are playing a video game inside.)

Benson: Hey guys, you're gonna pick up tortillas for the quesadillas, right? 

Rigby: (Wins gold in the game) Aw, YES! 

Benson: Great, thank you. 

(Flashbacks to Mordecai and Rigby walking down The House's steps while playing portable video games. Benson then comes from inside the house to speak to them.) 

Benson: Since you guys are headed out anyway, this might be a good time to get those tortillas. 

Rigby: What did he say? 

Modecai: I think, uh...have a good time? 

(Cuts from flashback)

Mordecai: Maybe if you just reminded us one more... (Benson throws his hat in Mordecai's face.) Uh!

Benson: I shouldn't have to remind you at all! You two never listen to me and I'm sick of it! 

Rigby: Don't be mad, Benson. 

Benson: Mad? I got mad the last time you ignored me. This time I'm...I'm...deeply offended! And now, I have six pounds of cheese and not one tortilla! What kind of quesadilla can you make with that, huh?! (Turns red) WHAT KIND?! 

Skips: You can't make a quesadilla without tortillas; that's just cheese.

Benson: Thank you, Skips. So now, because of Mordecai and Rigby, here we all are, tired, hungry, nothing to eat. And if you two don't get those tortillas right now, [red] YOU'RE FIRED!

(Cut to the Grocery store. Mordecai and Rigby stand at the aisle with tortillas.)

Rigby: (Feels around the tortilla bags) Well, which ones are we supposed to get? There's like thirty different kinds here.

Mordecai: How should I know?

Rigby: Well, can you check?

(Mordecai takes a piece of folded paper out from his handbag and opens it.)

Mordecai: It's a note from Benson. "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, you're probably standing there like two boneheads trying to figure out which of the thirty different kinds of tortillas to get."

Rigby: How does he know?

(Rigby takes the note from Mordecai.)

Rigby (continued): Dude, he typed it. "Since you never listen, I'll remind you that we need an extra large bag of Casa Queso Handmade Style Flour Tortillas. If you come back here with anything else, you're fired. Your boss, Benson." And then there's some clipart of a bomb and it says, "The clock is ticking."

(Rigby shows it to Mordecai, and they laugh. Mordecai grabs the correct tortillas.)

Mordecai: "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, go get the exact tortillas I want, or I'm gonna get all mad".

(They laugh as they leave. We cut to them driving the cart on the road.)

Mordecai (continued): "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, I know you love burgers, so we're having quesadillas".

(They laugh)

Rigby: Yeah. "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, if I don't get something to put this cheese between right now, you're fired!"

(They laugh again.)

Mordecai: Dude, we're actually running kinda late on getting these tortillas back to the park.

Rigby: Yeah. Maybe we should take that new shortcut.

Mordecai: Good call.

(He makes a left turn into the shortcut, straight into the forest.)

Rigby: And then earlier Benson was all like, "Don't forget to gas up the cart before you get tortillas!" And I was just like, "Cool, dude. Thanks for the....heads.....up?"

(The cart suddenly comes to a stop.)

Mordecai: I see. (Turns the cart key, but it doesn't start up) Dude, why didn't you just listen to Benson and gas up the cart?

Rigby: Because he never says anything important?

Mordecai: Except that was important, 'cause now we're stuck in the middle of the woods! Argh! (Sighs) Okay, this is gonna be painful, but I think we have to ask Benson to come get us. (Grabs the cart's radio) Guys? Hey? Benson? Are you there?

(No response comes, but a fart is suddenly heard.)

Rigby: Sorry.

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: I really am sorry, Mordecai! My body just starts talkin' when it's hungry.

Mordecai: (Sighs and drops the radio) Just give me the phone. (Rigby reaches under himself, grabs the phone, and hands it to Mordecai. Mordecai blows on it repeatedly, then checks it.) Awesome. No service. We're gonna have to walk the rest of the way.

(Cuts to them walking through the forest, with Mordecai holding the tortillas. They then stop when they see a fork in the road.)

Mordecai: I'm pretty sure if we just head towards those trees... (They walk in the path he chose and we cut to the two struggling through branches and leaves, getting dirty in the process. They then walk into an open area, with Rigby pulling leaves out of his tail.) Okay. That didn't land us where I thought it would. But if we could just get to the other side of that river... (Cuts to them carefully walking across a shallow river, only to stop at a dead end. Cuts to them walking across the river again in the opposite direction while Rigby growls to himself.) All right, so, I think if we can go down that hill...

(Cuts to the two stepping down a steep hill)

Rigby: Easy...easy...

(They both suddenly slip and fall down the hill, yelling. We pan to the sky, and it transitions to nighttime. Pans back to Mordecai and Rigby walking through more woods)

Mordecai: Okay, maybe if we-

Rigby: (Angrily) Maybe if we what? You even have any idea where we're going? I've seen that Skips rock four times!

(Shows the Skips-like rock)

Mordecai: Okay, but-

Rigby: Dude, just face it. We're lost!

Mordecai: Yeah, we're lost.

Rigby: And I'm cold and hungry!

Mordecai: Well, I'd say we go back to the cart for shelter, but I don't even know where that is any more. (Rigby suddenly starts eating a tortilla.) What're you doing? You can't eat those, we have to give 'em to Benson! (Takes the tortilla)

Rigby: Well, he's not gettin' anything if we die up here!

Mordecai: But maybe there's something else we can eat. (Looks around and finds a pile of rocks) Can we eat...rocks?

Rigby: I saw one show where the guy made a three-course meal out of nothing but tree bark.

(Mordecai's stomach growls, then they run to a nearby tree and start eating the bark.)

Mordecai: It's not that bad. (Turns to Rigby) Whoa, dude... (Mordecai's vision has turned everything pixelated.)

Rigby: (Turns to Mordecai) Huh? (Stops eating and looks unsure) That's not right, man. (Rigby's vision has turned Mordecai in a burger with a tortilla for buns.)

Mordecai: What show did you see that bark thing on?

Rigby: (Scratches chin) It was on, um... Oh, Crazy Eats.

Mordecai: The one where the guy makes himself insane by eating stuff that's not food? Rigby, they don't even go outside on that show!

Rigby: But Mordecai, the inside is the outside. (The tree disintegrates and we zoom into Rigby's eye as he repeats, "The inside is the outside.")

(A stream of hallucinations occur as the two are affected by the tree bark. They then fall onto the ground in the forest, weak. They sit back up, and Mordecai brushes himself off.)

Rigby: (Holding his head) Aw, man... What happened?

Mordecai: I don't know, dude. But we're not gonna survive this, are we?

Rigby: (Wraps around himself) Dude, it's so cold!

Mordecai: (Shaking) We're gonna freeze to death before we can get Benson these tortillas...

Rigby: If Skips was here, he'd know what to do!

(Flashbacks to them back at the camping area, in Rigby's perspective. Benson is instructing safety tips.)

Skips: Pay attention, guys. You're gonna need to remember this stuff.

(Cuts back to the present, and Rigby gasps)

Rigby: Mordecai! We need to remember what Benson said in his wilderness presentation!

Mordecai: (Places down the tortillas) Dude, that's it!

Mordecai and Rigby: Remember, remember...

(Flashbacks to Rigby's perspective again, playing a video game. He struggles as he tries to look up at Benson instructing, and Thomas in a bear costume.)

Benson: ...And that's how you survive a bear attack. (Shakes hand) Thank you, Thomas. (Thomas walks away) Hey, Mordecai and Rigby, I need your eyes up here!

Pops: (Raises hand) Oh, Benson. What about when it gets chilly?

Benson: That's a great question, Pops. Now, it may look like I'm just wearing a jacket up here. (Unzips the green jacket) But underneath it, I have on a sweatshirt, followed by a long-sleeve thermal, followed by a t-shirt, followed by a tank top. It's called 'layering', and your key to temperature regulation.

(The flashback ends, and we're back at the woods.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Layering! (Looks around)

Mordecai: There's nothin' to make layers with.

Rigby: I see some layers.

(Shows the bag of tortillas. Clock transition to the two layered up with tortillas. Rigby tries to grab more out of the bag, but Mordecai takes it away, making him whine.)

Mordecai: That's enough for now. We need to save the rest for Benson.

(Wind blows, making Rigby shiver and cross his arms.)

Rigby: We better get a move on.

(The two begin to hike through the forest, starting a montage. Using tortillas as snowshoes, Mordecai walks over to a river and scoops up water with another tortilla. Once he drinks it, he spits it out in disgust. Rigby taps his shoulder to grab his attention, then tries to remember more from the presentation. Recalling on how Benson used dew for drinking water, they mimic him and drink some dew. Cutting to a mountain, we see them carefully stepping downwards. Worrying, Rigby starts to remember what Benson showed on how to climb down mountains, and they copy the method. Transitioning to the woods at night, Mordecai holds a rod of tortillas and strikes it against a tree, making a torch to scare away a bear. Rigby twists his rod of tortillas into a spear, and they chase away the bear. Back into daytime, they walk through the woods some more as Rigby leaves a tortilla trail. Cutting to a river, a bearded Rigby is shown fishing and an equally bearded Mordecai brings in a net full of fish, much to their happiness. They remember how Benson had shown how to catch large amounts of fish with a net, and Rigby nods to Mordecai in approval. Cutting to Rigby sitting on a rock, he tries to make glasses out of tortillas. Noticing that he just used up the last of the tortillas, he and Mordecai go back through the woods to pick up the tortilla trail. Cuts to Mordecai stirring a green liquid with a tortilla bowl and spoon. He spreads the liquid on a giant infection on Rigby's leg. We then cut again into nighttime, with Mordecai warming his hands around a campfire and Rigby leaning against a tree near a tent made of tortillas. It suddenly begins to snow. Switching to a snow-filled area, Rigby is on a tortilla sled being pulled by Mordecai. He writes weakly into a tortilla journal that states, "DAY 37".)

Rigby: "End is near. Tell Benson we tried." (Pants and groans as he closes the journal and rests his eyes)

(Mordecai groans as he drops the rope and neals to the ground.)

Rigby (continued): (Weakly) Did we make it?

Mordecai: No...

Rigby: (Sighs) It wasn't supposed to end like this, Mordecai. (Coughs roughly)

Mordecai: (Holds Rigby's face and says, tiredly:) No, Rigby. Don't give up. There's gotta be one last thing we can remember from Benson's presentation.

Rigby: No, bro. This is it. See you on the other side... (He closes his eyes with his hands, but Mordecai opens them again.)

Mordecai: Please, just try to remember, Rigby! Do it for Benson.

(Rigby groans as he remembers Benson demonstrating with a phone.)

Benson (in flashback): And if all else fails, find a cell phone signal. It may just save your life one day.

Rigby: (Suddenly full of excitement) We have to find a cell phone signal!

Mordecai: (Pats around himself) Okay, okay, let me just- (He pulls a phone from behind him and gasps, as the phone only has one percent of battery life left.) It's almost out of batteries...!

Rigby: (Busts out of tortilla blanket) Then, let's go!

(Mordecai starts to run with the phone above his head, trying to catch signal, while Rigby limps behind him. Mordecai checks the phone, which only has 0.4% battery life remaining. As he puts the phone in the air again, Rigby limps harder.)

Rigby: Mordecai! (Pants) My leg... (Pants) I can't!

Mordecai: Yes, you can! This is our last chance, Rigby! Are you gonna die like a little baby or are gonna help me?

Rigby: I-I-I'll help you, Mordecai!

(Cuts to Mordecai holding Rigby up high, running, as Rigby holds the phone higher in the air.)

Mordecai: Anything?!

Rigby: Run faster!

(They both yell as they run away from the snowy field and into the woods.)

Rigby: Come on, phone--please, please, please! (Gasps as a small shred of signal is found) A bar, Mordecai! We have a bar!

Mordecai: (Eyes watering) A bar?

Mordecai and Rigby: (Chanting) A bar! A bar! (Laughs hysterically)

Mordecai: Ugh, wait, call dude! Call!

Rigby: (Starts to dial) Okay! Shh, shh, shh! I'm dialing! (Gasps as the phone makes a tone) It's ringing!

(As the phone calls, a ringtone is heard. Their faces fall as we pan to all of the other guys standing a few feet in front of them. Benson is holding his phone as it rings, then slowly brings it to his face as he answers it.)

Benson: Hello...?

Mordecai: (Puts Rigby down) I can't believe it. You guys are still here! After all this time?

Rigby: (Tiredly) Everything has changed so much since we've been gone... (Picks up pine cone) Is this still called a...pine cone?

Mordecai: What year is it?

Thomas: You guys have only been gone a couple hours.

Skips: We could hear you yelling on the other side of those trees. But every time we had Thomas go check it out, you attacked him.

Benson: (Holds up Rigby's filthy tortilla jacket) These tortillas are soggy and dirty.

Rigby: (Runs up to Benson and grabs his leg) Oh, Benson, you saved us!

Mordecai: (Takes off tortilla hat) Yeah, Benson. We're sorry we never listen.

Rigby: And you're so smart! How did you know we were gonna forget what tortillas to get?

Benson: (Pushes off Rigby) All right, all right, that's enough! I had a feeling this might happen. (Turns to the group) Thomas, can you take the back-up burgers over to the grill, please?

Mordecai and Rigby: (Hopefully) Back-up burgers? (Raises arms) Whooaaaaa!

Benson: Just don't touch any of the food.

(End of "Survival Skills")

(We begin in Skips' car, driving through the woods. The eight groundskeepers are all dressed in Halloween costumes.)

Muscle Man: (dressed like a president, most likely Abe Lincoln) Man, I can't wait to get to the party. (to HFG, wearing a fake mustache) It's gonna be all, like, "What's up, Mr. President?" (He laughs. He and HFG then hi-five each other.) You know who else is, like, "What's up, Mr. President?" My mom!

Benson: (dressed like pirate) Muscle Man, enough.

Pops: (dressed like mummy) Do you think they'll have snacks?

Mordecai: (dressed like Frankenstein's monster) It's the biggest Halloween party in town, Pops. They'll have all the candy you can eat.

Rigby: (dressed like Beef Burrito) Yeah, but all the good stuff will be gone before will get there! This drive is taking forever!

Benson: The map says it should be right around here.

Muscle Man: Stop reading a map wrong, Thomas! You're gonna get us lost!

Thomas: (dressed like Lone Ranger) I don't even have the map!

Muscle Man: You shut it, Thomas! What did I tell you about talking to me?

Benson: Leave him alone, Muscle Man, he's just an intern. It's bad enough he doesn't get paid.

Thomas: Wait, you guys are getting paid?

Skips: (dressed like Dracula) Benson, you sure you know where we're going? I haven't seen a house for miles!

Benson: It's fine, I know what I'm doing. (flips his eye patch to other eye)

Rigby: (groans) Ugh! I'm dying of boredom back here.

Pops: We could pass the time with a game of "I Spy".

Rigby: No way. You got carsick the last time we played that.

Mordecai: I know! (in signature word stretch) How about some scary stori-i-i-es?

Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

Benson: No! Pops can't handle it.

Pops: Oh, nonsense. I'll be fine.

Benson: Okay. (to Mordecai and Rigby) But if he gets scared, you two are in serious trouble.

Rigby: Yeah, yeah.

Mordecai: All right. It all started at the Bowling Alley on a dark and stormy night.

(Fade to Stardust Lanes. Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, and Steve, Mordecai's uncle, are playing a free-for-all bowling match. Mordecai bowls a strike.)

Mordecai: WHOOOOAAAAA! That's game! (Rigby, Muscle Man and HFG grumble to themselves.)

Uncle Steve: Ha ha. Yeah, you show them how you roll it, Mordi. Heyyyyy!

Mordecai: (laughs nervously) Yeah. Thanks, Uncle Steve.

Muscle Man: Man, forget this! You already won three games in a row! (points back to Uncle Steve) Plus, your weirdo uncle is making me uncomfortable with his lame tie.

Uncle Steve: Just dressing for the occasion, my man. Don't act like you're not jealous of this. (He pulls his tie and it lights up.)

Muscle Man: Come on, Fives. Let's bail.

Rigby: Yeah, let's go, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Aw, come on, one more game, or are you guys afraid to lose?

Muscle Man: No way, bro!

Rigby: Oh, it is on!

Mordecai: Ha ha. Yea-a-h! Uncle Steve, you down to play another game?

Uncle Steve: I don't know, Mordi. I'm kinda low on fundage. This tie wasn't cheap, you know.

Mordecai: It's cool, Uncle Steve. I got five bucks.

Uncle Steve: Oh, no, Mordi. I-I couldn't.

Mordecai: Don't worry about it. You can pay me back later. I know you're good for it.

Uncle Steve: Okay. I promise I'll get you back.

Mordecai: (He hands Uncle Steve his five bucks.) Yea-a-h! Game on! Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh! Hey-hey! (He then bumps into Uncle Steve and his tie gets stuck in the ball return.)

Uncle Steve: Whoa! Oh, no! My tie!

Mordecai: Uncle Steve! (Uncle Steve then screams as he gets sucked into the ball return, but cuts to the next scene where it shows a tree branch being fed into a wood chipper and shows Mordecai and Rigby at Uncle Steve's grave.) I can't believe he's gone. This is all my fault. If I hadn't pressured everybody to play that extra game, my uncle would still be alive.

Rigby: Aw, don't talk like that, man. Life just does its thing, you know? If I were you, I'll be more upset about losing the five bucks. (He gets punched by Mordecai) Ow!

Mordecai: Not helping, dude. (We now go back to the house, and we see Mordecai in his bed) All... my fault. Ugh. It's all my fault. (We now see inside Mordecai's dream where he is with Uncle Steve who Mordecai is handing five bucks to him like what happened before) Yea-a-h! Hey-hey! (He bumps into Uncle Steve and gets sucked into the ball return like before.) Uncle Steve!

Uncle Steve: Whoa! Mordy, why did you have to play another gaaaaaaaaaame! (He then is disintegrated.)

Mordecai: Noooooooooo! (He wakes up) Rigby? (Then he sees dead Uncle Steve, and screams. He then rubs his eyes, hoping it was just an illusion. Going into bathroom to wash his face, he sees dead Uncle Steve in the mirror.) Get a hold of yourself, Mordecai. All the guilt is making you see things. Its not real. Its not real. (He glances up and sees dead Uncle Steve in the mirror again.) Ahh! (Runs down hall into living room where all the Pops portraits turn into dead Uncle Steve portraits.) Rigby! I can't stop seeing my dead uncle!

Rigby: Ugh, me either.

Uncle Steve: Mordi!

Mordecai and Rigby: Ahh! (Uncle Steve lights his tie up...) Ahh! Ahh! (...As he crawls out the television set...) Ahh!? (Mordecai and Rigby run out of the house.)

Rigby: Dude, I thought your uncle was dead!

Mordecai: He is! (Uncle Steve is seen running after Mordecai and Rigby.)

Uncle Steve: Mordi!

Rigby: (Mordecai and Rigby run into cemetery) Did we lose him? (They trip onto Uncle Steves grave.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ahhh!

Uncle Steve: (Growls; then coughs) Mordi. Hey, I bet you thought I forgot. Well, here you go. (Gives Mordecai money.)

Mordecai: Uhhhhhh...

Rigby: Dude, it's your five bucks!

Uncle Steve: Hey, a promise is a promise.

Mordecai: Wow. Thanks, Uncle Steve.

Uncle Steve: Eh, no problem. Hey, you take care, now.

(Steve then growls as he burrows into the dirt. End of "Payback".)

Mordecai: The end.

Benson: Whats wrong with you!?!?

Mordecai: What?

Benson: Just look at Pops!

Pops: (Scared) Oh, its all right, Im fine really. (Shaking) (Phone Rings) Ah!

Rigby: Pops, chill. It's just the phone.

Mordecai: Im gonna take this. (answers phone) Hello?

Margaret: Mordecai!

Mordecai: Oh, hey Margaret.

Margaret: We just got to the party. Are you inside?

Mordecai: No, actually were still driving. We got a little lost.

Margaret: Ahh man, thats a bummer.

Mordecai: It's cool though, weve been telling scary stories.

Margaret: Ooh, scary stories. Hey, Ive got a good one, put me on speaker phone. (Mordecai puts Margaret on speaker phone.)

Mordecai: Hey, Margaret's gonna tell a story. (Mordecai puts Margaret on speaker phone.)

Benson: It'd better not be scary!

Margaret: Don't worry, it's a funny one. It all started we were getting into the cart to go to a Halloween movie.

(The story starts off with Mordecai, Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen getting into the cart dressed up in costumes.)

Mordecai: Aw yeah-a! Halloween movie time.

Rigby: Shotgun!

Benson: Ah, ah. What do you think you're doing?

Rigby: Going to the movies.

Benson: No you're not, we need that cart to patrol delinquents T.P'ing the park.

Mordecai: But Margaret's car is in the shop. How are we gonna get to the theater?

Benson: Not my problem.

(A duo of punks appear out of nowhere. They've already toilet-papered the trees.)

Teenager 1: Ha, ha. Trick or treat, losers.

Teenager 2: Yeah, trick or treat, losers.

Benson: Let's roll. (Benson and Skips drive the cart, and leave the scene.)

Margaret: I guess that's it. There's no way we'll make it there in time now.

Mordecai: What? We can't give up yet.

Eileen: Yeah, I'll call a taxi.

Mordecai: There's still some time. We'll probably just miss the previews.

Eileen: (on phone) Thank you. (Hangs up the phone) They said ten minutes.

(A bus shows up.)

Mordecai: That was fast.

Rigby: I thought you said you called a taxi.

Bus Driver: Need a ride?

Mordecai: Uh, could you takes to the movie theater downtown?

Bus Driver: We'll take you wherever you need to go. Climb aboard the party bus, and join the party.

Rigby: Cool!

(Rigby and Eileen run inside the bus.)

Mordecai: See, nothing to worry about.

Margaret: Yeah.

(Mordecai and Margaret walk inside the bus and we see a sign on the bus that says "The Party's Killer". The bus drives out of the park, and see a taxi pull up.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa.

(We see other people on the bus partying.)

Party guy 1: Welcome, fellow citizens, to the party bus!

All party people: Party bus!

Mordecai: Ha, ha. Whooooooooo!

Rigby: Yeah-a!

Eileen: Sweet!

(Mordecai and Eileen are dancing, and Rigby is eating snacks.)

Mordecai: Margaret!

Margaret: This is crazy!

Mordecai: I know, right?

Eileen: Come on! (Margaret laughs) There's some great costumes in here!

Margaret: Yeah, there must have been a huge sale on white wigs or something.

Mordecai: Soda?

Margaret: Thanks. (gasp) Mordecai, look! (Mordecai and Margaret notice a couple of people getting older.) Are they all right?

Party guy 1: Oh, yeah, they're cool. Just partied a little too hard, I guess.

Mordecai: Pfft! Ha, ha.

Margaret: Oh! Heh.

Party guy 1: Party bus! Party bus!

Mordecai: Yeah! (laughs) See? Isn't this great?

Margaret: You're right. Party bus!

Mordecai: Yea-uh!

(While the four continue dancing, Margaret notices that that they passed the movie theater.)

Margaret: Hey! He's passing the movie theater. Driver, stop the bus! Let us off! Stop the bus! (The bus driver just ignores her, and turns up the music.) Ugh. Mordecai, the bus isn't stopping!

Party guy 1: (elder voice) You can't stop now, the party's just getting started.

Mordecai: You don't look so good, man.

Rigby: Yeah, how long have you been here?

Party guy 1: Fifteen...minutes. (He then disintegrates, and the four scream in shock.)

Margaret: Those weren't white wigs, everybody's getting older!

Eileen: (gasps) Mordecai, your face!

Mordecai: What? (Then we see him all wrinkled up.) Huh?

Margaret: (elder voice) You're getting older!

Mordecai: (elder voice) So are you! (We see Margaret now wrinkled up. And Rigby is starting to get wrinkled up, and Eileen takes off her glasses while she is all wrinkled up.) We need to get off this bus now! Stop the bus, stop the bus!

Bus Driver: You can't stop the party bus once it's started. Right,everybody? (The four look behind them showing that all the citizens are now turned into dust, and now Mordecai, Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen are now in shock.) What's that saying again? Party till you drop! (His wrappings around get taken off, revealing that he's a skeleton, while he laughs evilly.)

Mordecai, Rigby, Margaret and Eileen: (elder voice) Ahhhhhhhh!

(The Bus Driver speeds the bus up, and the gang get pushed away.)

Margaret: (elder voice) (to Eileen) Help me with the door. (The bus driver continues to laugh evilly.) It won't open!

Mordecai: (elder voice) Stop the bus! (He throws the bus driver and he breaks apart, while he still laughs. Then he gets in the driver seat, and stomps on the breaks, but the bus doesn't stop.) The brakes don't work!

Rigby: (elder voice) Try the emergency break!

(Mordecai pulls the emergency break, and it breaks off. Desperately searching around for another way, he shifts the stick into reverse and the bus stops, which results with the dust from all the citizens on the bus to land on Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen.)

Mordecai: (elder voice) Well, at least we still--.

(The bus starts going again but goes in reverse.)

Margaret: (elder voice) Why did you put it in reverse?

Mordecai: (elder voice) It was the only thing I could think of!

Rigby: (He looks at his hands, returning to the gang's real age.) Guys, look!

Margaret: We're getting younger!

(But the de-aging doesn't stop, since the bus is still in motion. The gang starts shrinking, turning them younger until they're kids again.)

Mordecai: (younger voice) We gotta get off this bus!

Eileen: (younger voice) Guys look, an emergency hatch! (Eileen points at a hatch in the roof.)

Mordecai: (younger voice) Come on, everybody up! (Rigby opens the hatch. Mordecai lifts everyone on top of the bus, but when Mordecai finally gets out, he notices they all have turned into babies.)

Rigby, Margaret and Eileen: (younger voice) Now what?

Mordecai: (younger voice) We gotta jump! (The gang holds each other's hands, and then they all jump off of the bus, giggling.) We did it! We got off the party bus.

Mordecai, Rigby, Margaret and Eileen: (younger voice) Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

(They all pop out of existence. As the Party Bus falls apart, the bus driver's maniacal laughter is heard. End of "Party Bus".)

(The driver's laughter is quickly replaced with Margaret's.)

Rigby: Uh, was that supposed to be funny?

Margaret: Yeah, "The party's killer". Get it? (Pops is trembling and Benson gets angry) Mordecai? You there?

Mordecai: Um, I gotta go. I'll see you there. (Hangs up the phone)

Benson: That's it, no more stories from anyone.

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what?

Rigby: Come on, Benson, don't act like this is all our fault. If you haven't gotten us lost, we wouldn't be telling stories, now would we?

Benson: DON'T MAKE ME MAKE SKIPS TURN THIS VAN AROUND!

Rigby: Skips, don't make Benson make you turn this van around! I have to go to this party, I just have to!

Skips: Hey, knock it off or I'll--.

(A truck gets in the gang's way, there is a close up of them screaming. We then cut to black. End of "Terror Tales of the Park II, Part 1")

(A tow truck pulls Skips' car out of a tree, the group's alive! But not all of them are happy.)

Benson: I hope you two are proud of yourselves, look where your "scary stories" got us now!

Rigby: Hey! Skips should've watched where he was going!

Benson: JUST GET IN THE TOW TRUCK!

Rigby: Okay! Okay!

Benson: Listen, there's a party we need to get to, but we're running late, do you mind dropping us off?

Tow Truck Guy: No problem, chief.

(The gang get on the road again, till they get stuck in traffic.)

Rigby: This is going to take forever! Anyone got another story?

Mordecai: Yeah-ah!

Benson: Are you kidding me? We just got in an accident, Pops is scared half to death, and you want to tell more stories?!

Pops: Actually, I wouldn't mind hearing one more tale.

Muscle Man: Yeah, they've been pretty good.

Thomas: I'm down.

Skips: It would be nice to hear one while I'm not driving.

Rigby: See, Benson, even Skips wants to hear one!

Benson: Ugh! Okay! Okay! Okay! You all just have to hear one more story? Fine! But this time, I'm telling the story!

Rigby: Aw, what?

Benson: Now pay attention, you just might learn something.

(The story starts off with Mordecai and Rigby exiting their room, laughing)

Rigby: Pickles. (chuckles) (Benson throws wallpaper equipment at Mordecai and Rigby.) Whoa, watch it!

Mordecai: What's all this?!

Benson: You two are re-wallpapering the house today.

Mordecai: Aw, what?!

Rigby: Why?!

Benson: Because of that!

(We see a drawing of Rigby saying 'This job is like prison!' and a drawing of Mordecai saying 'I found a way out!' and pointing to a hole in the wall, and Mordecai and Rigby laugh.)

Rigby: Wait, how do you know it was us?!

(Benson groans)

Mordecai: Okay, okay, fine, we'll just patch up that one spot!

Benson: No, you can't, because that wallpaper is discontinued, so you gotta do the whole house with this new stuff so it all matches!

Rigby: But we don't even know how to wallpaper walls!

Benson: (throws instructions at Mordecai and Rigby) Just follow the instructions, and make it nice or you're doing it over again.

Rigby: You didn't have to throw the equipment at us!

Benson:(Off-screen) Yes, I did!

Rigby: No, no, no! Step 5A: Smooth the glue paste before applying the paper, 5B: Smooth the paper and apply the glue paste.

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Rigby: Gah! I don't know, man! These don't make any sense.

Mordecai: Agh! I hate wallpapering! I just wish we could get someone else to do it.

(The TV slides into the hallway with them.)

Jan: Do you hate wallpapering, trying to do it yourself, but the instructions just don't make sense?

Mordecai: Did you turn on the TV?

Rigby: No.

Jan: Hi. I'm Jan, the wallpaper man. I'm here to do away with all your wallpaper problems, and believe me, I've been there. Nobody likes wallpapering, not even me! I've just been doing it for over 40 years and have gotten pretty darn good at it. So let me deal with all the headaches for you.

Rigby: Yeah if only we had a million bucks!

Jan: (Off-screen) Now you're probably thinking "Yeah, if only we had a million bucks!" And normally, you'd be right! (Cuts to TV) But with Jan the wallpaper man, the first job's free!!

Mordecai & Rigby: What???

Jan: That's right. I'll wallpaper your whole house for free, but in return I only ask that for your next wallpaper job, you call old Jan here first. (Cuts Off-screen) A free job for first dibs on your second job, now that sounds like a good deal, right!? (Cuts to TV) So call 555-01 WALL PAPER MAN and I'll wallpaper your house, I really will! (TV turns off)

Muscle Man: Why is the TV in the hallway?

Mordecai: Hey Muscle Man, do you ever order stuff off the TV?

Muscle Man: Oh for sure! Especially if it's a local business. I once bought some sweet old-replica hand grenades from this old army dude off the TV, and it turns out they were the real deal!

Mordecai: What? No way!

Muscle Man: Remember when the shed exploded last week and I told you it was lightning?

Rigby: Yeah it wasn't even raining.

Muscle Man: Exactly. I'm getting a second shipment today. I'm telling you, local TV dudes always come through for you.

(Cuts to the front of the house. The doorbell rings and Mordecai opens the door.)

Jan: Hi there. Jan the wallpaper man.

Mordecai: Oh great. Come in, come in.

Jan: Well, okay.

(Jan enters the house)

Mordecai: So this is it, you'll do the whole house, right?

Rigby: For free, right?

Jan: Yes, yes, the whole house for free.

Rigby: We don't even have to tip you?

Jan: Nope, nope, nothing like that. I promise.

Mordecai: Ha ha, great.

Jan: And it's just you two here?

Rigby: Ah, no, there bunch of people in and out of this place. Should we clear everyone out?

Jan: Oh, no, no, that's fine. I'll deal with them if I see them.

Mordecai: Well, we got some important video games to play. So we'll leave you to it. (Mordecai and Rigby going upstairs.)

Jan: Okay, thank you, sirs! I'll be done in no time...

(Three hours later. Mordecai and Rigby playing video game it says "Game Over".)

Rigby: Augh!

Mordecai:Let's take a break.

Rigby: I can't feel my thumbs.

Mordecai: (sighs) Let's go check to see if that wallpaper guy's done. (He and Rigby open the door and see the wallpaper. It's a peculiar red and deep purple color.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Rigby: Nice! Check out this new wall shine.

Mordecai: Dude, this is the best idea we've ever had.

Rigby: Let's check out the rest of the house.

(Suddenly, they hear Pops scream in terror.)

Mordecai and Rigby: POPS!

(The two rush to the staircase and see Jan putting up wallpaper over Pops.)

Pops: Bad show, bad show, bad show!

Mordecai: Stop! What are you doing!?

(Jan turns at them and hisses. He now has pointed teeth. He then scampers up the walls and into the next room.)

Mordecai: Are you okay? What happened? (He pulls down the wallpaper.)

Pops: I don't know! I was just heading to the kitchen for an ice lolly when that man fell upon me.

Rigby: This guy must be nuts!

Mordecai: We gotta get him outta here before Benson sees.

(A scream is heard.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Benson!!!

(They all turn a corner and enter the kitchen, but everything is covered in wallpaper. everything seems to lead off into darkness. Mordecai is confused.)

Rigby: What did that guy do?

Benson (O/S):  HELP!!

Mordecai: Come on. (They all hurry down the hallway.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Benson!!!

(They come to a point where the hallway splits up in different directions.)

Mordecai: Come on. (They head down one of the paths. Mordecai realizes they've come to a dead end.) Aaagh! We gotta go back. Go back!

(They race back to the junction point and head down another path. They come to a point where this path splits up into two. Mordecai looks left, then right, then left again. He sees Jan scurry past, laughing wickedly.)

Mordecai: HEY!

Benson (O/S): Help!

Pops: Benson!!!

Mordecai: Okay, you and Pops go find Benson. I'm going after the wallpaper man.

Rigby: Come on, Pops.

(Mordecai is in pursuit of Jan, who is crawling along the ceiling.)

Mordecai: HEY! STOP!

Rigby: Benson? Hello?

Pops: Oh, I don't like this at all.

Rigby: Shh. Quiet, Pops.

(Rigby and Pops listen for a moment.)

Benson (O/S): Help!

Rigby: Benson, we're coming! (They hurry down the hall.)

(Mordecai is still chasing Jan. Jan suddenly stops and straightens up at a dead end. The wall suddenly opens up, and he runs through it. The wall closes up and curves to the left.)

Mordecai: Whoa...

Rigby: We must be getting close.

Pops: Benson!!!

(Pops and Rigby suddenly bump into Mordecai.)

Mordecai: What the...

Rigby: Aaagh! We're getting nowhere!

Pops: Look!

(Pops points at the wall. It opens up to reveal another passageway. Then the other walls box them in.)

Mordecai: I think it wants us to go this way. Come on.

Pops: I think we're growing.

Mordecai: No. The hall's getting smaller. What the...? (Feels the wall.) It's an optical illusion. Go back.

Pops: (gasps)

Rigby: No, no, no! I can't stand small spaces!

Mordecai: Okay, just calm down.

Rigby: I need air! I can't breathe!

Mordecai: You can breathe. Don't panic!

Rigby: I need to get outta here! Aaagh! (Starts panicking.)

Mordecai: Aw, stop! Rigby!!! (Rigby starts scratching at the walls and ends up ripping right through the wallpaper.

Mordecai: Whoa...

Benson (O/S): Help!

Mordecai: Hold on, Benson! Come on, let's go.

(The three of them start ripping through the wallpaper until they finally happen upon a cavern.)

Rigby: Are we still in the house?

Benson: Hey! Help!

(Benson, Skips, Muscle Man, and a delivery guy are all wrapped up in wallpaper and are hanging from the ceiling.)

Rigby: Whoa...

Mordecai: Are you guys okay?

Benson: Do we look okay? Hurry up and get us down from here.

Rigby: Who's that guy?

Delivery Guy: I was just trying to deliver a package to Mitch Sorrenstein. I don't wanna die! (sobs)

Mordecai: Don't worry! We'll get... (Jan suddenly jumps in front of them and hisses menacingly.) Let our friends go, and then GET OUT OF OUR HOUSE!!!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Pops all gasp in horror as Jan reveals himself to be a gigantic spider. Jan grabs Pops, wraps him up in "wallpaper silk" and hangs him from the ceiling.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yaah!

(They start chucking rocks at Jan. They bounce right off of Jan, and one hits Benson.)

Benson: Watch it!

(Jan shoots a thread of silk at Mordecai and Rigby, but they dodge out of the way. Mordecai chuck another rock at Jan's head, but he ducks and it knocks Muscle Man down from the ceiling. Muscle Man escapes from the wrapping.

Muscle Man: Eeeyuh! I'm free. Eat on that, you eight-legged-- (Jan stabs Muscle Man with his leg.) Whatever. That didn't even hurt. If your job was to kill people, you'd probably get fired. Heh heh.

(Jan lifts Muscle Man up into the air.)

Muscle Man: Huh? Wha...? Hey! Don't even think about eating me, bro!

(Muscle Man lets out screaming cries as Jan swallows him in one gulp.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Muscle Man!!!

Benson: Help us! What are you waiting for?

(Mordecai and Rigby continue throwing rocks. One of them breaks open Skips' wrappings, and he falls and lands on his ankle, twisting it.)

Skips: My ankles!

(Pops is seen falling to the floor, and lands on his arm, hurting it.)

Pops: Uhh... My arm...

Benson: Great rescue. (Another rock breaks open Benson's wrappings. But he lands on both feet, unharmed.) You're gonna kill us before that spider gets the chance.

(The delivery guy lands in Benson's arms.)

Mordecai: Come on, let's go! We gotta get outta here!

Benson: No, you don't! You two are staying here!

Mordecai and Rigby: What??

Benson: You hired that thing. You fire it.

(Mordecai and Rigby glance over at Jan. He growls.)

Rigby: That spider's gonna kill us!

Benson: Not my problem!

(Mordecai and Rigby groan in frustration.)

Rigby: Okay! Listen up, Jan! (Jan steps forward.) You're fired! (Rigby shrieks and dodges as Jan attempts to spear Rigby with his leg.)

Mordecai: Dude, that was a metaphor! We need to stay and destroy him!

Rigby: What? Really?

(Jan roars and causes rocks to fall fro the ceiling. Several boulders land in front of the exit, blocking it.)

Rigby: Now what?

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man's package!

Rigby: What? Muscle Man's package?

Mordecai: He was expecting a package of grenades! Just go get the box. I'll cover you.

(Mordecai throws rocks at Jan to try and distract him while Rigby goes for the package. Rigby grabs it, then rushes back to Mordecai.)

Rigby: Got it!

Mordecai: Open it! Open it!

Rigby: I can't... this stupid tape... (he tears the tape off, and the package pops open.) There.

(Jan suddenly grabs them both.)

Rigby: Great! So, what's the plan now? And aren't these just replica grenades?

Mordecai: No, Muscle Man said they were the real deal, remember?

Rigby: Oh, yeah!

Mordecai: Quick, pull out all the pins!

(They pull some of the pins from the grenades. Jan moves them closer to his mouth.)

Mordecai: Special delivery.

Rigby: Time to redecorate.

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Rigby: Time to redecorate. Because of all the wall---ahh, just throw it.

(They throw the package with the live grenades into Jan's mouth.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whooooooooa!

Mordecai: Boom!

Rigby: Eat it, Jan!

Mordecai and Rigby: Ha ha! Yea-uh!

Rigby: Hey, hold on. How far away are we supposed to be before these things go off?

Mordecai: Wait, what?

(The scene cuts to outside, where Benson, Skips, Pops, and the delivery guy have made it out safely. Just then, the grenades go off and the house explodes, sending them all flying to the ground. Benson glances back up at the burning foundation. End of "Wallpaper Man".

Benson: The end.

Mordecai: Dude, that story was lame!

Rigby: Yeah, Benson, we're not even that dumb!

Benson: It's my story! I'll tell it how I want it!

Rigby: Listen up, everyone. I got a story about Benson.

Benson: No, you don't! No more stories, Rigby!

Tow Truck Guy: Party is just up ahead, chief.

(They almost made it to the party everyone cheers)

Benson: Ha! See? Great. We're almost there.

Rigby: Yeah, totally great. That means there's enough for me to tell the story to chose how dumb Benson is!

Benson: No, there isn't! Story time is over, Rigby!

Rigby: Once upon a time, Benson was so dumb!

Benson: No stories!

(Rigby and Benson begin to fight. Everyone tries to stop them, but Rigby pushes Benson and accidentally bumps into the Tow Truck Guy. The Tow Truck goes really fast and crashes into a tree. Everyone comes out of the house.)

Margaret: Are you okay?

Mordecai: (Coughing) Yeah, we're fine. Huh?

(They show their bodies, and they've become ghosts like High Fives.)

Mordecai: Aw, what?! We didn't survive the crash?!

Rigby: I guess not.

Benson: (Turning Red) UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!! RIGBY, YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!

Rigby: (Slams Benson's hand) You can't fire me, I'm dead! (Whooping) PARTY!

(Everyone cheers and they enter the house. Benson is still outside.)

Benson: (Grunts) Why do I even bother?

Benson: (Grunts) Yeah, I guess.

(Benson goes inside the party. The camera goes up and shows the half moon and the episode ends.)

(We see two kids from High Score egging Skips's House and laughing, until the glare of Benson's Cart's headlights alarm them. Benson then steps out of his cart.)

Benson: Private property boys, hit the road. 

Kid: Is that... Are you a cop?

Benson: I'm not a cop, I'm your worst nightmare. (The kids throw eggs at Benson, but he dodges them)  Hey! Hey, stop it!

Kid: Nice costume, loser! 

(The kids both laugh, pick up their bags and run away. Then Benson goes back to his cart and starts chasing them. Scene pans to Pops' House, where a Halloween party is going on. The scene changes to various parts of the house filled with guests doing various activities; one man is sliding down the banister of the stairs.)

Man: Happy Hallow- (Falls off of the banister. Scene changes to Thomas telling a story to the other park workers, except for Pops and Benson.)

Thomas: But the maniac was calling from outside the house! Wait, is that right? I mean, I mean, inside the house! (The other park workers groan at the story and throw their soda cans at him)

Muscle Man: Bad Thomas, bad! Seriously, that made my ears sad, bro. 

Mordecai: There's no way you're winning the bet. (Pops walks over)

Pops: Bet?

Skips: Yeah, Pops, whoever tells the scariest story wins the pot; our Halloween candy!

Pops: Ooh!

Rigby: And whoever tells the worst story, probably Thomas, has to wear their costume until Thanksgiving.

Pops: Oh ho ho ho! What a humdinger of a bet!

Mordecai: Your turn, Rigby. Candy up!

Rigby: Hmph. Hmph. (Rigby pours his candy on the pile) Okay. We open on Mordecai eating cereal.

(Mordecai is eating cereal when Rigby walks in with a box)

Rigby: Aww, yeah!

Mordecai: What is that?

Rigby: Today I am a man, Mordecai! My trampoline days are over! I ordered a real bed with pillow covers and everything!

Mordecai: What the- How did you afford it?

Rigby: I've been saving up all year! Every time I found a penny, instead of hucking it into traffic, I put into a jar.

Mordecai: Those things are impossible to put together, dude.

Rigby: Whatever, I'm a man now, and men build things. Besides, it comes with tools.

Mordecai: Pfft. Good luck.

Rigby: I don't need luck, cause it's gonna be easy. (Rigby opens the box and paper and debris come out. Rigby unfolds the paper and reads it.) Hmmm, hmmm. So easy.

Rigby: Done! (Bed falls to pieces)

(Rigby is hammering his bed)

Rigby: Done! (Camera scrolls onto a dirty Skips) Thanks for your help, Skips.

Skips: Yeah, don't mention it. (Leaves the room)

Rigby: All right. Time to try this baby out! (Rigby jumps onto the bed) Oh, yeah. (Rigby turns the TV on)

News Reporter: Have you purchased a bed recently?

Rigby: Yes.

News Reporter: It may have been a fatal mistake. During a shootout with police, dangerous murderer Johnny Allenwrench, identifiable by his gold tooth, fell into a UMAK machine and was manufactured into a bed. Due to a clerical error, it was shipped out to stores. The company has issued a recall on all 'Killurgen' beds.

Rigby: I feel bad for the losers who got that one. (Camera zooms into the box that says KILLURGEN) I'm one of those losers!

News Reporter: And so, people with beds are at threat level: Beds. (Somebody gives the reporter a piece of paper) This just in, police forensic experts have tracked the specific bed with the murderer in it. If your bed has the following SKU, you are sleeping on a killer. (Camera zooms onto the bed SKU, scrolling as the reporter reads out the number) 623570406.... umm, well, this last number's kind of smudged, I can't really make it out. It's an... 8! An 8.

Rigby: NOOOO!

(Johnny cackles, swallowing Rigby with the duvet. Cut to the kitchen, where the groundskeepers are playing cards.)

Muscle Man: What's the deal with Rigby?

Mordecai: Oh, he got a new bed or something. Nobody cares, dude!

(Rigby is screaming, and rips the covers in half)

Rigby: I could use a little help, guys!

Mordecai: It's just a bed, dude! You sleep in it!

(Rigby is still screaming)

Mordecai: Urgh! That's it! (Throws his cards onto the table in anger, then walks up the stairs) Rigby! Stop messing around!

(Johnny spits Rigby onto the wall. Johnny grabs a wrench.)

Mordecai: What the...?! Rigby! Careful with that Allenwrench! (He tries to attack Johnny, but gets knocked back) Urgh! That was a firm mattress...

(The groundskeepers run in)

Benson: What's going on?

(Johnny grabs Rigby)

Johnny Allenwrench: Back off, man, or the kid gets wrenched!

(The guys gasp)

Mordecai: Dude, he's super strong, Benson.

Benson: Well I got powers, too. Powers of negotiation! Let Rigby go!

Johnny Allenwrench: You'll call the cops.

Benson: We won't call the cops if you let him go. Right guys?

Guys: Nah. No way.

Mordecai: Why would we?

Johnny Allenwrench: I've been on the run for so long. I'm just tired, man.

Benson: Look, I'm the park manager here. I can give you a job.

Johnny Allenwrench: You'd do that? You'd do that for old Johnny Allenwrench?

Benson: Yeah. You won't have to run anymore.

(Johnny drops his wrench and lets Rigby go. The groundskeepers cheer.)

(Benson shakes Johnny's hand in agreement)

Benson: You'll start tomorrow.

(Johnny is watering the flowers and humming)

Rigby: NOW!

(All of the groundskeepers, except Benson and Rigby, attack Johnny with axes)

Benson: Way to plan that ambush, Rigby.

Rigby: Way to lie to his face, Benson.

Benson: Hey, it's called negotiating.

(He and Rigby laugh)

Benson: Rigby, you're getting ALL the promotions.

(He high fives Rigby)

Rigby: YES!!

PROMOTION! (Rock music plays)

Muscle Man: Wait, did he just say Rigby was getting ALL the promotion

THE END (Rock music plays again. End of "Killer Bed".)

Rigby: (He mimics the rock music) Now that's a story, fools!

(Everyone except Muscle Man agrees)

Muscle Man: Eh, I can do better.

Rigby: What?! Why don't you put your candy where your mouth is.

Muscle Man: So you want me to eat it?

Rigby: No! I mean put it on the table.

Muscle Man: That's what I thought you meant.

Rigby: Then do it then!

Muscle Man: I will! (Muscle Man pours his candy on the pile) This one's gonna make you have to change your chonies.

(Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost are finishing smashing pumpkins)

Rigby: Man, disposing all of these pumpkins is the best job Benson ever gave us. (He smashes a pumpkin)

Muscle Man: It's times like this, I know I'm in the right profession. (He smashes a pumpkin)

Mordecai: Oh man, last one. (A huge pumpkin is sitting right next to them)

Rigby: How do we even... I mean, what do we even...

Muscle Man: I know what to do.

(Muscle Man drives a cart and smashes the last pumpkin, eventually heading into some fog as the gang laugh)

Hi-Five Ghost: Hey, where are we?

Mordecai: I don't know it looks like some kind of... (They approach a pumpkin patch) abandoned pumpkin patch?

Muscle Man: Alright, bros, we hit the jackpot! This party just got a whole lot pumpkiny-er!

Mordecai: Are you sure we're supposed to smash these? This is pretty far away.

Muscle Man: I take my orders very seriously. Benson said all the pumpkins.

Rigby: Woah, check that out.

(They see two pumpkin scarecrows dressed like pilgrims on two poles)

Muscle Man: (To the pumpkin scarecrows) Hey, where did you get those clothes? Out of my mom's trash? (Laughs)

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing?

Muscle Man: This is the perfect time to brush up on my crowd work. (To the pumpkin scarecrows) Hey, it's just a joke. You seem a little stuck up. Stuck up on that pole!

(As Muscle Man is making jokes, Rigby walks over to the scarecrows and reads a plaque that has been placed between them.)

Rigby: "Smash all you want, but leave these two pumpkin lovers alone". Aw, man. That just makes me wanna smash 'em more!

Muscle Man: Then let's do it! It's the Circle of Life, or whatever.

Mordecai: I think we should go...

(Everbody starts complaining)

Hi-Five Ghost: Awwww...

Muscle Man: What?

Rigby: But we're supposed to!

Mordecai: ...Go smash these pumpkins!

Muscle Man, Hi-Five Ghost, & Rigby: That's what I thought!

(The gang knocks the female pumpkin scarecrow down with rocks, laughing)

Muscle Man: Alright, I got this one. (He jumps on the female scarecrow and smashes her, which is shown in slow motion. This causes debris to splatter all over the male scarecrow.)

Mordecai & Rigby:  (In slow motion) WOAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!

(Muscle Man high fives Fives)

Muscle Man: Now go for the dude!

Hi-Five Ghost: Haha, okay.

Mordecai, Rigby, & Muscle Man: Fives! Fives! Fives!

Hi-Five Ghost: Uuuuhhhhhhhhh.........

Muscle Man: Just do it bro!

Hi-Five Ghost: Okay, I'll just grab his head now.

(As Fives is about to grab the male scarecrow's head, he comes to life and grabs Fives's arms. Fives screams in terror.)

Scarecrow: YOU! (Fives screams and Fire is coming out of his mouth and eyes) You smashed my hot wife! (The fire fades out, revealing his glowing red eyes and mouth) Now you will reap what you've sown!

Mordecai: Fives, just phase through, man!

(Before Fives can do that, however, the scarecrow turns him into a solid pumpkin) 

Scarecrow: You boys want to smash some pumpkins? Let's smash some pumpkins! (He smashes Hi-Five Ghost and collects the seeds)

(The guys scream. Muscle Man quickly puts his hands over his mouth to stop himself from throwing up. The scarecrow laughs evilly.)

Muscle Man: Scatter! (The gang run away into a cornfield in separate paths, making the scarecrow follow one of them) Serpentine. Serpentine!

(The scarecrow continues to follow one of them. Mordecai is running and eventually decides to hide behind a mini tractor. The scarecrow can tell somebody is nearby, but before he can make sure of it, he hears Rigby scream.)

Rigby: (Off-screen) MORDECAI! WHERE ARE YOU?!

(The scarecrow begins to follows the sound. Mordecai tries to escape, but only rams into the scarecrow, who is standing right behind him. The scarecrow snarls as Mordecai screams. Mordecai is about to get away, but the scarecrow grabs his ankle and turns him into a pumpkin.)

Mordecai: Not the face!

Scarecrow: I hope you like, SQUASH! (He stomps on pumpkin Mordecai, squashing him. He then collects the seeds.)

(Meanwhile, Rigby runs into a barn and slides the door close)

Rigby: There's no way he can get me in here!

(Right after he says this, the scarecrow punches a hole through the door)

Scarecrow: Gotcha!

(Rigby climbs up a ladder and runs for an open window. The scarecrow tries to catch him, but fails. Rigby looks down and sees that he is very high up. The scarecrow continues to crawl after Rigby.)

Rigby: Remember to roll.

(He jumps out of the window, but the scarecrow manages to grab his tail. Rigby is then turned into a pumpkin.)

Scarecrow: Got a ripe one here! Just in time for, FALL!

(He drops pumpkin Rigby, causing him to splatter on the ground below. The scarecrow collects the seeds.)

(Muscle Man is shown runing into some reeds, but he trips on a branch. The reeds are still rustling, causing Muscle Man to get up and run away. He's in a circle in the middle of the cornfield, and he squeals as the reeds continue to rustle.)

Muscle Man: Show yourself! (He hears the scarecrow laugh when the reeds started rustling again. He repeatedly punches the air in front of him, as if the scarecrow was there. He then bumps into the scarecrow.) Please, bro, let me go. I didn't know that sign was serious.

Scarecrow: Of course it was! She was my soul mate.

Muscle Man: You'll find someone else.

Scarecrow: You think it's that easy to meet someone else!? Don't get me started on dating! (He grabs Muscle Man and turns him into a solid pumpkin as he laughs) Now, it's time to join your pump kin! (short pause) Wait, does that even make sense?
(He snarls and throws Muscle Man onto the ground, squashing him. He then bends down to collect the seeds. He walks away with the seeds, eventually tossing them all up in the air and into the ground.) That'll teach 'em. (He chuckles evilly as he returns to his pole)

(The scene fades to the next day, where a pumpkin patch ceremony is happening)

Child: (Sees the scarecrow) That's a weird-looking scarecrow.

Woman: Yeah.

Kid: Mommy, Mommy, I want one of these!

Kid's mom: Ohhhhhh.....

Pumpkin Muscle Mans: Kid, you don't want one of us. There's some choice ones over there.

Pumpkin Rigbys: Um, I'm not ripe!

Pumpkin Hi-Five Ghosts: Uhhhhh, me neither!

(The pumpkin gang argues as the scarecrow laughs evilly in the background before winking. End of "Jacked-Up Jack-o-Lantern")

Muscle Man: WHOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Now that was a story, ladies!

Rigby: Boring!

(The guys disagree on Muscle Man's story)

Muscle Man: You guys just don't get to twist ending. It's supposed to be ironic.

Rigby: You're lucky Thomas's story was such a pile, or you'd be stuck in that costume for weeks.

Skips: What are you supposed to be, anyway?

Muscle Man: Peanut butter on bread, bro. I even used the real deal. (He scoops a little peanut butter off his belly) Anybody hungry?

Mordecai: Aww, sick!

Rigby: That's the Thomas's story of costumes.

Muscle Man: Shut it! You haven't seen the whole thing. Hey, Starla!

(Her head comes out of a bucket of water intended for apple bobbing. She then walks over to him.)

Starla: Hi, Mitch.

Muscle Man: Do you prefer creamy or chunky? (He places a giant lunch bag over top of them and they kiss, causing peanut butter and jelly to leak out of the bag)

Rigby: Anybody else have a story?

(We cut to black. End of "Terror Tales of the Park III, Part 1")

(Benson enters the house with the bag of candy from the two kids)

Benson: (Sighs) What a night, at least I made it to the...huh? Aw, what, I missed the party?

Muscle Man: Not technically. The party is only over when Scottie leaves, isn't that right Scottie?!

Scottie: (Eating a bowl of chips) Yeah, man.

Benson: Ugh! Unbelievable! This is what I get for doing your chores.

Rigby: Dude, is that candy?

Benson: Confiscated candy I got from a couple of park hooligans, no thanks to you. What are you guys even doing, anyway?

Pops: We're playing a scary story game. Whoever tells the best scary story wins everyone's Halloween candy.

Muscle Man: And who ever tells the lamest story has to wear their costume until Thanksgiving dinner. Thomas! (He pretends to cough)

Thomas: You got a cold, Muscle Man?

Mordecai: So how about it, Benson, are you in?

Rigby: Yeah, you got anything better than that costume?

(Benson gives them a glare and throws the candy bag on the table)

Benson: It all took place during a morning meeting, just like any other morning meeting.

(The guys are having a morning meeting)

Benson: Well, I guess that just about does it. Hanging the Halloween signs, the pumpkins... oh yeah, there is one more thing. We should all get out of here, because there's gonna be a 200 year old poltergeist in the house tonight.

Mordecai: Poltergeist? Are you serious?

Rigby: That sounds awesome!

Benson: No, not awesome. Remember all those things people were saying back in the 1980s? (He counts some off on his fingers) Like bogus, righteous, and wigging out? Well, there was actually a guy saying them 200 years ago, (A flashback sequence begins) and his name was Jebediah Townhouse. He was the previous owner of the house, and everything he ever said or did was two-hundred years ahead of its time.

Jebediah Townhouse: Yo, yo what up, what up what's popping unlocking homies.

(Everyone looks at each other as Jebediah Townhouse begins to dance)

Bensons: Because he was so ahead of its time the town folks knew it could only mean one thing.

Man #1: Witch!

(The mob begins to surround Jebediah Townhouse as he continues to dance when an 80s instrumental piece sounding like MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This plays. Later he goes all the way on top of the house as the clouds begin to turn dark grayish black)

Jebediah Townhouse: Can't touch me up here suckers!

Man #2: Get down Jebediah so we can kill you, you witch!

Man #1: Come now no need for harsh words. Brother Townhouse, please come down here so that we may kill you.

Jebediah Townhouse: I'll show all Y'all. I'm gonna come back in two-hundred years and everybody is going to be talking like me, I'll be the king of the world. (Jebediah Townhouse begins to spin on the top of the center of the house. As he stops lightning appears in front of him) Boom!

Man #1: But we'll all be long gone in two-hundred years!

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh, uh? Well, I'll just kill whoever is in my house then. Boom! (His body turns dark red and melts in the house)

Benson: He fused his soul into the house. Silently waiting for two-hundred to return.

(The thunderclaps in the house as the image of Jebediah Townhouse's face appears and he laughs evilly as the flashback ends)

Benson: Tonight's the night he comes back. So, we should all get out of here before it gets dark. maybe if Jebediah Townhouse doesn't see anybody, he'll go away.

Muscle Man: Pfft lame.

Rigby: (Giggles) If you wanted the house to yourself you can just ask.

Mordecai: Yeah Benson that story doesn't make any sense.

Benson: Well sense or no sense he's coming. There are plenty of documents down of hall of records that back this up. (He packs his suit case and puts it inside his car)

Mordecai & Rigby: Benson's superstitious, Benson's superstitious. He's oh-so very scared, he's shaking in his britches.

Benson: Yes, very scared. (closes the door and puts his sunglasses on) That's why I'm leaving and so should you. Trust me, it's your only chance for survival. (He turns on the car and leaves)

Muscle Man: Dudes, dudes, I just got an idea. We should all come back tonight and see who can stay in the house the longest.

Rigby: Oh yeah now we're talking.

Mordecai: We should make it a little more interesting.

Muscle Man: How so?

Mordecai: We should all put in twenty bucks and then whoever stays the longest can keep all the money.

Rigby: Wait, wait that's like. (He counts the guys) a hundred bucks.

Mordecai: Yeaa-uhh.

Rigby: Alright let's do it.

(The scene cuts to see lightning in dark skies. We get to see Pops' room. Pops is in his bed having trouble sleeping as he goes to sleep. Suddenly he hears his record turning on as he cover his ears. Suddenly the record scratches as it stops. Pops gets out of his bed, turns off the record and goes back to sleep. Suddenly he hears a voice)

Jebediah Townhouse: Pops. (Jebediah Townhouse is seen in the record as he turns around and looks at Pops) What up, Pops!

(Pops screams in terror. We cut to see Mordecai and Rigby playing video games)

Rigby: Where you at, where you at?

(They hear Pops screaming in terror running downstairs)

Mordecai: Dude, Pops, what's wrong?

Pops: J.. Jebediah Townhouse. He spoke to me in my phonograph.

Mordecai: Dude, Pops, Jebediah Townhouse isn't real.

Rigby: Yeah. If your trying to scare us to get the hundred bucks, it's not gonna work.

Pops: But I don't want the hundred dollars, (He takes out his wallet with a few Butterscotch Ripples) I'm already rich.

(Suddenly the TV turns off and lights turn off as well)

Rigby: Aw, come on, we're about to put the hurt on that fool.

Mordecai: Alright, everyone stay cool.

(Mordecai opens the desk, picks up the flashlight and turns it on. Suddenly they heard a strange noise)

Rigby: What's that noise?

(They walk outside of the hallway, the light shows the door and the strange noise is heard again)

Pops: It's him, it's Jebediah Townhouse!

Rigby: Oh no, dude, you might be right Pops, he's come to get you!

(Pops screams in terror. Rigby starts laughing and gets punched by Mordecai)

Mordecai: Knock it off, dude. It's probably nothing. (The door suddenly begins to knock) Rigby, go open the door.

Rigby: No, you go, I don't want whatever is out there killing me so I don't get my hundred bucks.

Mordecai: Alright, we'll all go.

(Mordecai picks up a golf club, Rigby brings another golf club when he opens it in the bag. They walk toward the door, Mordecai gulps and looks outside of the window. Suddenly a figure looking like Jebediah Townhouse pops out of the window. Mordecai screams, the figure opens the door. The three guys scream in terror. Mordecai and Rigby start beating the figure with their golf clubs. The figure is revealed to be Muscle Man in disguise with a garbage pail on his head and High Five Ghost was in the garbage pail)

Muscle Man: What's your deal, bros?!

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man, you scared us to death!

Rigby: What's your problem?!

Muscle Man: Just having a little fun, bro. You don't think I was gonna come over and not try to scare you. Pfft, that hundred bucks is as good as mine.

Rigby: Dude, what were you wearing on your head?

Muscle Man: Fives doesn't have a rain coat, so I'm covering him from this storm with this garbage pail. Geez you don't have to go crazy on me with the golf clubs. Now let's see who can stay in the house the longest.

Mordecai: Ugh, fine.

(We cut the scene to see the storm outside of the window blowing the curtains, with the guys playing the board game Muscle Man was wrapped up with that blanket as High Five Ghost hits the clock line swirling it and stops to 8 as he moves the board game character)

Muscle Man: Nice. You're probably gonna win. Your turn Pops.

(Pops hits the clock line swirling and stops to 9 as Pops gets happy. Suddenly the line starts to swirl by itself and hits to 6. The camera shows Jebediah Townhouse climbing on the escalator and looks at Pops and he screams in horror)

Pops: It's him. (Points at the board game) It's Jebediah Townhouse!

Mordecai: Where? I don't see anything.

Rigby: Yeah, you're freaking me out, Pops.

Muscle Man: Ugh! I can't take this. All this scary stuff is making me hungry. Come on, Fives.

(He removes the blanket and the two walk away to the kitchen with Muscle Man holding the burning candle)

Muscle Man: I wonder if they have anymore of those frozen burritos.

High Five Ghost: Yeah, that'l be awesome.

Muscle Man: Bean and cheese, beef and bean, green chili.

(Muscle Man opens on top of the refrigerator revealed to be the face of Jebediah Townhouse)

Jebediah Townhouse: Yo yo! Ice to meet you fool!

(Muscle Man gasps as Jebediah Townhouse stretches the refrigerator as he's about to eat them but the two run away)

Muscle Man: What the?

(Jebediah Townhouse laughs in the oven)

Jebediah Townhouse: What's cooking Home Skillet.

Muscle Man: Home Skillet? Nobody ever says that anymore. You're a couple decades too late with that bro.

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh yeah? Well, why you on the hot grill?

(Fire comes out of him as Muscle Man and High Five Ghost scream in horror as the other guys on the coffee table playing board games hear them)

Rigby: Ugh! He's probably eaten our food.

Mordecai: He's probably just trying to scare us. You better not be eating all our burritos, dude. (Mordecai opens the door holding another burning candle and walks in the kitchen to search for Muscle Man & HFG) Muscle Man? Fives? (He looks at the oven and Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are revealed to be turned into brownies. Mordecai yells and runs back to Rigby and Pops) We gotta get out of here. It's real. Muscle Man and High Fives both have been turned into brownies!

Pops: Aaah, I knew it. We're done for!

Rigby: Whoa, Whoa wait just hang on a second. If Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are both brownies, then technically we get more money, right?

Mordecai: Yeah you're right. We should just try to stick this out.

(Rigby hums. Suddenly Jebediah Townhouse pops out of the board game)

Jebediah Townhouse: Yeah!, stick it out to the Max!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops scream)

Mordecai: Wait, the Max? What?

Rigby: Hey, nobody talks like that anymore man.

Jebediah Townhouse: What? Nah, you guys are bugging.

Mordecai: What is this guy even...

Jebediah Townhouse: When you wigging out, you know? I mean, you guys are totally bogus.

Rigby: (Points at Jebediah Townhouse) No we don't know, 'cause no one talks like that anymore bro.

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh yeah? Well, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

Mordecai: RUN!

(The guys run for their lives as Jebediah Townhouse chases after them but suddenly gets stuck by the empty door beam)

Jebediah Townhouse: Hey, yo get back here fools! I know where you live!

Mordecai: Aaah! We gotta get out of here!

(Jebediah Townhouse's head pops out of the door)

Jebediah Townhouse: Jebediah is in the house!

(The guys scream in terror as they run upstairs but suddenly it turn into gums with teeth on top and a tongue. Pops beings to slip, Mordecai and Rigby hold on to the stair banister as Pops slides down to Jebediah Townhouse. He goes inside his mouth and and gets eaten by him)

Jebediah Townhouse: Aw Yeah, I gotta have my Pops.

(Mordecai and Rigby yell in horror)

Jebediah Townhouse: Time for some dessert.

Rigby: Come on dude let's go!

(They run up to the top of the hallway. Jebediah's head pops out of a window with heads as his eyes and mouth)

Jebediah Townhouse #1: Hey, you dummies don't have a hall pass!

Jebediah Townhouse #2: Yeah, you gotta have a hall pass, dummies!

(They all laugh as they charge towards Mordecai and Rigby as they scream in terror running towards the window)

Mordecai: Dude, the window! (He tries to open it but it doesn't open) It's stuck!

(Rigby beings to scare at Jebediah Townhouse is still laughing coming straight toward them)

Rigby: Wha.. What are we going to do?!

(Jebediah Townhouse still laughing charging toward them)

Mordecai: The attic! (Mordecai opens the attic with ladders come out of the attic)

Rigby: Hurry! (They climb fast as Rigby lost balance and falls down) MORDECAI! (Mordecai grabs Rigby on the leg) Pull me up, quick!

(Jebediah Townhouse continues laughing and charging Mordecai lifts Rigby right on time as Jebediah Townhouse crash in explosion blowing Mordecai and Rigby away)

Mordecai: Who are we kidding we shouldn't never done this.

Rigby: Yeah, I don't even know if I don't want a hundred bucks anymore.

(Jebediah Townhouse laughs as the beams on top of the attic turn into Jebediah Townhouse's arms and hands three Jebediahs come out of the knuckles)

Jebediah Townhouse #1: A hundred bucks? That's major moola.

Jebediah Townhouse #2: Since you don't want it.

Jebediah Townhouse #3: Can I just have it?

(Mordecai and Rigby scream in horror as they run towards the window)

Mordecai: Quick, up to the roof!

(As three Jebediah Townhouse laughs they made it outside of the window as an arm crashes outside of the window the climb on top the roof)

Mordecai: I think we're safe up here.

(Jebediah Townhouse's head pops out of the roof)

Jebediah Townhouse: Raise the roof, Y'all. (Mordecai and Rigby shock in terror as he shaking his head the left and right the two hold on his hair) Where my home boys at? Where my home boys at? There they at, There they at.

Rigby: Make it stop!

Mordecai: Dude, I can't take this guy anymore, forget the hundred bucks let's get out of here.

Rigby: Dude, no, it's to far to jump down!

Jebediah Townhouse: Hey my hair is totally tubular, get it, tubular!

Mordecai: Ugh, I'm going for it! (Mordecai jumps and yells)

Rigby: Mordecai! (Rigby jumps and joins Mordecai)

Jebediah Townhouse: Huh?

Mordecai: Eat on that Jebediah Townhouse!

Mordecai & Rigby: Oooooooooohhhhhh!

(Jebediah Townhouse's hands caught them)

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh, there it is!

(Jebediah Townhouse puts Mordecai & Rigby inside his mouth and eats them and burps but Benson burps. End of "The Previous Owner")

Benson: Excuse me, anyway that's my story.

(The guys love the story)

Mordecai: Dude, Benson, that was awesome.

Pops: I agree good show, a story like that deserves all the candy.

Muscle Man: Hear that Thomas looks like your stuck in your lame costume till Thanksgiving.

Thomas: Aw man.

Benson: Gee, guys, thanks! I'm glad you like it, because it's all true.

Rigby: Huh?

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Benson: Yep, it's all true (Flashback starts with mob holding torches and hay rake with the storm coming out of the sky and Jebediah Townhouse on top of the rooftop) Jebediah Townhouse actually existed and he actually vows to come back in two hundred years to hunt who ever was in the house, but not before signing deed over to Mr. Mallard.

Jebediah Townhouse: (Holding a deed) Sign this, boy.

(Young Mr Mallard sign his name with his pen)

Jebediah Townhouse: Shazam!

(The lightning hits Jebediah Townhouse and melts in the house)

Rigby: Come on, Benson are you being serious?

Benson: Yes, totally serious.

Mordecai: I don't know, guys, I think he's just messing with us.

Pops: (Talking in the phone) Hmm, yes hmm I see, yes goodbye. (He puts the phone back) Oh that was Papa, there is a Jebediah Townhouse.

(The guys gasp in horror)

Mordecai: Well, when is he suppose to show up?

Skips: Yeah, shouldn't we get out of here or something?

Benson: (Checked his watch) Hmm looks like my watch is a little fast, he shouldn't been here five minutes ago.

Scottie: You should really get your watch fixed, man.

(Scottie eats chips then suddenly Jebediah Townhouse pops out of the table and ate Scottie)

Jebediah Townhouse: Hmm hmm, I didn't just crash your party, did I?

(Jebediah Townhouse's hands comes out of the ceiling the guys scream. Outside of the house Jebediah Townhouse's head pops out of the roof the house on the left turns into his arm then the garage door turns into his foot and lift the house)

Jebediah Townhouse: Jebediah Townhouse bet you with the wrong house. (Kicks his right leg) Yeah, boy, that's what I'm talking about (Laughs) Happy Halloween, homies!

(Episode ends)

(The episode begins at the park morning meeting)

Benson: And Mordecai and Rigby, let's have you pick up trash by the snack bar.

Rigby: Ugh! Again?

Benson: Don't worry, this is the last time you'll be on trash duty for a while.

Mordecai: Awesome! Wait, we're not getting another intern, are we? Because I don't think I can handle another spy situation.

Benson: No, I've actually got some very big news about your dome-estic situation!

(everybody stares at him)

Benson: Hopefully it won't cause any pan-dome-onium!

(everybody continues to stare)

Benson: Dome you have any ideas about what's going to happen?

(everybody is still staring)

Benson: No one, huh? Well, since I have to spell it out for you, Maellard's decided to seal off the park in a dome to create a contained ego-system! A group of scientists from the government are going to study it for a whole month!

Muscle Man: Bro, have would we ever have guessed that?

Mordecai: A whole month? Where are we supposed to go?

Benson: You'll have to move out, the dome's dropping tomorrow! Isn't that exciting?

Pops: Why aren't you more upset about the inconvenience?  

Benson: Because I don't live at the park.

Skips: So we can stay at your place?

Benson: Heh, well, my place, while officially a one bedroom, (the wind starts blowing strong) feels more like a studio. So there isn't really any room! (he looks up and sees a dome coming down onto the park)

Hi Five Ghost: It's not tomorrow! It's today! They're sealing the park today!

Muscle Man: Grab your valuables!

(everybody runs, as Benson looks up, not happily, we see Rigby take a load of pizza pouches, Mordecai takes some tapes and his TV, Muscle Man takes what seems to be a load of letters from his dad, Pops opens a safe with lollipops inside and Skips waters his plants, everybody starts to run)

Muscle Man: She's gonna seal! (the dome is seen getting closer to the ground) Lighten your loads! (he throws a load of letters away)

(Mordecai drops the bag with the TV inside, everybody continues running, Rigby then throws the pizza pouches ahead and jumps forward, but the dome seals, and Rigby jumps into it)

Rigby: Ow!

Muscle Man: (banging on glass) Grrr! Live free or die!

(everybody starts complaining)

Benson: Hey guys! Let's relax, okay? Like I said, they're not sealing the dome 'till tomorrow.

Hi Five Ghost: (angrily) Are you blind, man?! Can you not see that the dome has been sealed today?!

Benson: Calm down! Look, here comes Maellard now, I'm sure he can clear this whole thing up.

(a limo arrives and Mr. Maellard comes out of it)

Benson: Maellard! (Mr. Maellard points to his head and nods) Oh, okay! (Benson receives a phone call) Maellard! So the test run's looking pretty successful on our end! (he knocks on the dome) Good fit! Looks like we're in good shape for tomorrow! (he ends the call) See? So you can all-(he receives another call) Maellard again. (he answers) Benson speaking. (another limo arrives behind him) Oh, but I don't get dates wrong! (he looks behind him) And the dome is going to stay where it is for the next 30 days. (Mr. Maellard is seen speaking, then a scientist passes him a bag of money, he then hangs up) So...

Skips: We figured it out.

Rigby: This isn't fair!

(The guys complain again. Zoom in on Benson's face, full of anger and confusion.)

Benson: (to himself) I got the date wrong? But I'm me, Benson!

(He shakes he head in disbelief.)

Benson (continued): Emergency meeting, my office, now!

(Cut back to Pops' house.)

Benson (continued): So I'm sure you all know why we're here.

(All the park members, except Muscle Man, are in Benson's office.)

Skips: To figure out how to survive in a dome for a month?

Benson: To look at the e-mail I got form the dome guys and prove I was right about the drop date.

(Everyone else, except Pops, groans.)

Benson (continued): You won't be groaning when you see (turns computer around) this!

(The power goes out. Pops shakes his head as everyone else groans again.)

Benson (continued): It's okay. I've got a printed backup version.

(He turns to his file cabinets.)

Mordecai: That's not what we're mad about.

Rigby: You really print every email?

Benson: Yes, I do, for this exact type of situation. So it's not like you can make fun of me because I wasn't prepared. Yep, you can't off the power to my physical mail, or as I call it, my p-mail.

Mordecai: (groaning) We don't care.

Skips: Is your p-mail gonna feed us for a month?

Pops: I'm scared!

Rigby: I'm hungry!

Benson: Listen, I'm sure you'll all calm down when you see...

(He pulls out a printed email.)

Benson: What the...What's this?

Mordecai: You were wrong about the date. Now, can you please just help us?

Hi Five Ghost: We really need leadership right now.

Benson: No, this isn't right. It's all wrong!

(Muscle Man enters.)

Muscle Man: Do not go into the bathroom. The water has been cut off as well.

Rigby: Do you hear that?

(Everyone but Benson mumbles as they walk up to the window. A sound of a rocket is heard and dome pods appears flying in, dropping packages on parachutes.)

Mordecai: What are those things?

Hi Five Ghost: They're dropping packages!

Skips: Let's take a look.

Benson: Now wait just one...

(Everyone runs out, leaving Benson.)

(Episode begins with Benson, Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Fives at Pops' house.)

Benson: Ok, guys. I think we've all noticed that it smells like something died under the house, and it's gonna take a team effort to get rid of it. Muscle Man,...

Muscle Man: Hold up, Benson. I got some news.

(He gets up and walks over to Benson, while the others look at each other. He takes out a paper.) 

Muscle Man (continued): I wanted to let you all know that I've smelled my own whiff of departure. And I too have a list of things I wanna get done by the end of the day.

(He gives the list to Benson.)

Benson: "Dance on giant toy piano mat. Drive a monster truck. Get comfortable with my body"? That one's crossed out.

Rigby: What's going on, Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: I went to see Dr. Henry, and, well, I leave this world tonight. It's all going down at Wing Kingdom at 7 o' clock.

Hi Five Ghost: You mean like you're leaving the world or the Park? The world or the Park, right?

Muscle Man: (Sighs) I wish I could say more.

Mordecai: Dude?

Muscle Man: Take a few minutes to go over the list while I get my papers in order. I hope I can count on your support today.

(Muscle Man leaves)

Rigby: I don't buy it. He's gotta be messing with us.

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, why would he keep something like that from me? I mean, you guys are secondary friends, so I get that, but he'd tell me at least.

Skips: Ah, you know how he is. He likes to put up a strong front. (looks up the list) Swimming with dolphins. Heh heh. He really should do that before he--.

(He stops)

Pops: Before what, Skips? Before what?!

(All of a sudden, a portal opens up and Death drives out with his motorcyle. He steps off.)

Death: Any of you lot know where I might find Muscle Man?

Hi Five Ghost: Uh, uh, he's not here! He moved! Name change and everything, so just go on home, ok? Just go on home!

(Death laughs)

Death: Don't tell me he got cold feet. Hey, no matter. We'll just stick to the original plan for tonight, of Wing Kingdom.

Benson: What? You're in on this?

Death: Oi. Muscle Man's time has come. I've been where he's going. It's a frutal place full of misery and anguish. Oh well, haha, have a good one.

(He gets back on his motorcycle and drives back through the portal.)

Rigby: Bucket list? He leaves this world tonight? And now he has an appointment with Death?!

Skips: You don't need a pen to connect those dots.

Hi Five Ghost: I can't lose my best friend! Who would I spot at the gym?

Benson: Hey...

Hi Five Ghost: Who would eat my leftovers? I can't just throw them away!

(Benson places a hand on Fives.)

Benson: Don't, stop. That helps no one. What Muscle Man needs right now is friends who can hold it together and be strong for him.

(Fives stays strong.)

Benson (continued): And most importantly, he needs friends who will help him finish his bucket list.

(Benson places the list in his clipboard. We clock transition to Muscle Man's trailer, where they are all headed.)

Benson: (Enters the trailer) Muscle Man? We have to talk to you about the list. (Everyone else enters)

Muscle Man: (Inside the bathroom) Hold your horses, bro, I'm using it! (Muscle Man's phone rings) Someone take a message; I've been waiting for that call.

Hi Five Ghost: (Picking up the phone) Hello?

(Cuts to Dr. Henry's office)

Dr. Henry: Yes, hello, this is Dr. Henry. I'm trying to reach Muscle Man with some news about his condition.

Hi Five Ghost: (To Skips and Pops) It's Dr. Henry. (Back to Dr. Henry) What condition?

Dr. Henry: Well...I'm afraid I can't tell you that. Doctor-patient confidentiality, you understand?

Hi Five Ghost: Just be straight with me, doc. Is it serious?

Dr. Henry: Eh...yes, very serious. Your friend Muscle Man won't be with us much longer.

Hi Five Ghost: (Worriedly) You mean...?

Dr. Henry: Yep. (Turns to window) Very soon, he'll be in a better place.

Hi Five Ghost: Thank you, doctor. (Dropping the phone, he hangs up and turns to everyone else.) It's true! (Everyone gasps) I should have seen this coming. His cholesterol must be off the charts. He ate those deep-fried pig butt cheeks every day, and I just watched him do it!

Skips: (Places a hand on Fives) You can't blame yourself.

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. Muscle Man lived life to the fullest, and I'm sure he has no regrets.

Rigby: I figured he had at least three or four years left...

Pops: (Sadly) Bad show.

(Muscle Man comes out of the bathroom after flushing.)

Muscle Man: Aw, yeah! Are you bros down to help me finish what's on that list?

Benson: (Brings out his wallet and starts to tear up) Sure, Muscle Man. Whatever you need, it's on me. This is your day.

Muscle Man: All right, let's do this!

(Starting a montage, the group goes down what's on Muscle Man's bucket list, beginning with 'Drive a monster truck'. Benson writes a check to a monster truck driver, then we pan to Muscle Man in a yellow monster truck. He fist pumps before he dirves over a row of cars, making the others clap. He then spins doughnuts and crashes into the building wall, making Benson pay extra for damage. Next on the list is 'Dance on giant toy piano mat'. In a toy store, Muscle Man hops around on a giant, red toy piano mat, then slides to the other side. Skips gives him a thumbs up. A piano transition shows and we cut to Muscle Man swimming with dolphins and eating pizza as the others watch. Cutting to the Park, Benson pays a pizza delivery guy holding nine boxes of pizza. Clock transition to the guys behind a fence, cheering, as Muscle Man wrestles an alligator, as well as feed it pizza. Mud falls as a transition, and Benson is shown receiving money from an ATM. He gives the money to a jet pack worker, who signals that Muscle Man can fly now. Muscle Man then takes off into the sky, tears streaming from his eyes. Seeing his reaction causes Benson to cry, but he's interrupted by the jet pack worker, gesturing for more money, as Muscle Man wants to go again. Muscle Man flies away, and we cut to his trailer.)

Muscle Man: All right, dudes. Now it's time to give you all my stuff. (He places a box of his stuff on his AC.)

Mordecai: Muscle Man, you should hang onto this.

Muscle Man: I can't take it with me where I'm goin'. (Tears well up as he starts to cry) Noo, no! This is a mistake! (He takes the box and throws it to the ground. The others cringe as he starts to freak out, knocking over furniture. Skips comes and grabs him as he yells.) I still have more time, right?!

Benson: Muscle Man, please hold it together! (Muscle Man whimpers and Skips puts him down.) As hard as it is, you're not alone. We're with you to the end.

Muscle Man: (Calm) You're right. I gotta get through this day the same way I lived the rest of my life: chowing down on wings with my best bros, while we all wear matching white tuxedos.

(Cut to Wing Kingdom, with everyone in their tuxedos. Muscle Man and Rigby seem to be the only ones with an appetite to eat at the moment.)

Mordecai: You havin' fun, buddy? Enjoying your wings?

Muscle Man: (Finishes off a wing) Honestly, bro, they taste bittersweet. But I just wanted to have them-(Sadly)-one last time.

Rigby: (Covers his eyes) I can't watch!

Benson: (Has eaten some wings, and places a hand on Rigby's shoulder) Don't look away, Rigby, look at him! Look at this...Muscle Man! (Muscle Man has his face burried in the wing box, eating sloppily, when he raises his head to breathe and chew. Pushing away Rigby, he continues:) This guy, from who we've all learned so much--from this guy, his joke telling, his loyalty...

Hi Five Ghost: (Near-crying) I never wanted to be anyone's best friend, until I met you.

Muscle Man: (Shaking his head) You guys...

Benson: (Stands up) No, let me finish! What we'll remember most about you more than anything else is- (Holds in a vomit) Excuse me. Your passion, Muscle Man. Your passion! If you'll all join me. (He unhooks the jacket on his tuxedo and waves it above his head. The others, minus Muscle Man, do the same, causing Muscle Man to whimper.)

(A clock on the wall shows that the time is now 6:55. Everyone now surrounds Muscle Man.)

Pops: You have a style that can't be taught, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: That's the ultimate compliment, coming from someone so dapper. (Hi-fives Pops and turns to Mordecai and Rigby) You guys really know how to kick back and bro out. I respect that.

Mordecai: (Waving) We're workaholics compared to you, dude.

Rigby: Think they got unlimited wings on the other side?

Muscle Man: I know so, bro! (Hi-fives Mordecai and Rigby with both hands and walks to Skips)

Skips: You always seemed to know a guy. I'm proud to have been one of those guys.

Muscle Man: (Wipes away a tear) Hrgh...heh. Isn't this funny? Suddenly, you're the one being open and I'm the man of few words.

Skips: (Smiling sadly) Never thought I'd see the day.

(Muscle Man hi-fives Skips with both hands and walks to Benson.)

Muscle Man: Did you mean all that stuff you said earlier, Benson?

Benson: Every word.

(The two slap hands and share a bro-hug while crying. They then break the hug and sigh, and Muscle Man walks over to Fives.)

Hi Five Ghost: (Lips quiver) I don't- (Muscle Man puts his finger on Fives' mouth.)

Muscle Man: Shh. You don't have to, bro. I know. (Fives smiles and they both hi-five together, having Muscle Man whimper afterwards.) Don't follow me. (He starts to walk towards the restrooms, making Fives wail in sadness. As he walks, flashbacks from "The Night Owl", "The Heart of a Stuntman", "Rage Against the TV", "Karaoke Video", and "Replaced" are shown. The thoughts make his eyes water and he stops at the door. The others stare on, watching him.) I love you guys! (Saying this causes the others to burst into tears as he walks through the door.)

(Everyone else continues to cry until Death walks in.)

Death: 'Ello, everyone! Where might I find Muscle Man?

Skips: (Glaring) In the back.

Pops: (Rests a hand on Skips' arm) Easy, Skips.

Death: Right, then. (Walks away)

Rigby: Dude, what're we gonna tell Starla?

(Starla and John Sorrenstein walk in, dressed up.)

Starla: Where's Mitchy? He said to be here at seven for something important.

Mordecai: You mean, you don't know?

Starla: Know what?

Hi Five Ghost: Starla, he's-

(All of the lights in the building suddenly shut off. As the restroom door opens, fog billows out, and a cart with white flowers, an ice sculpture of Muscle Man, and Muscle Man himself are being pushed by Death. Starla gasps and Death sets the cart next to a boombox. A dramatic zoom-in of Muscle Man's face occurs. Death snaps, and an object covered by a tarp appears. He pulls off the tarp to reveal a tombstome that reads, "SO LONG BROS. 'MUSCLE MAN'".)

Starla: Noo! What did you do?! (Hics, then runs up to Muscle Man.) Mitch! Mitch! Mi-i-i-i-tch! (Continues crying and climbs to Muscle Man. Skips quickly takes her away.)

John: Muscle Man's last request was that I play this tape for you all. Here goes. (Places the tape in the boombox and clicks 'play'.)

(As the music starts, Muscle Man suddenly wakes up. He stands up, rips his shirt and pants off, and confetti falls as he begins to dance.)

Pops: (Eyes wide and in awe) Like a phoenix from the flame...!

(Muscle Man continues to dance as Mordecai and Rigby stare in utter shock, their mouths hanging open. Starla's eye shadow runs down her face and Benson's confusion turns into rage.)

Muscle Man: Now!

(Death presses a red button that sends fireworks above Muscle Man. Jumping off the ice sculpture, he preforms a split in front of everyone, who are still staring in shock.)

Muscle Man: Flip it!

(John flips over the tape and plays it. Slow music plays as a disco ball appears over the others' heads.)

Death: Another one bites the dust. (Hands Muscle Man a ring) Here.

Muscle Man: Heh, heh, yeah. Thanks, bro. (Walks to Starla and takes her hands) Starla, babe, you've been by my side through thick and thin, through slick and greasy. I can't think of anyone I'd rather have as my co-pilot for the rest of my days. (Starla wipes her tears on her arm.) My friends here helped me bury Muscle Man for good today. No more wild night scoop in the loop, no more homemade firecrackers. I'm a new man now, for my old lady. That new man is me, Mitch. Pleased to meet you, Starla. (Kneels on one knee)

Starla: (Sore from crying) What...?

Muscle Man: Now, Muscle Bro!

(John pulls a string that reveals a banner saying, "Marry me Starla, Love Mitch". Starla sniffles.)

Muscle Man: Starla, will you marry me?

Starla: Mmm...no.

Muscle Man: (Dumbfounded) Whaa..?! But I gave my old self a memorial for you!

Starla: And that's why I can't marry you.

Muscle Man: (Worrying) Babe!

Starla: I wanna marry the man I fell in love with. And that is Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: (Wiping away a tear) Are you for real? I can still be good old Muscle Man and have my sweet fun bun?

Starla: That's the only way!

Muscle Man: Whoa, okay. Let me try this again. (Kneels on one knee again) Starla, will you marry me, the Muscle Man me?

Starla: Yes!

Muscle Man: (Fits the ring on Starla's finger, grunting) You may have to let that out a little.

(Starla hops in Muscle Man's arms and kisses him while the others stand and watch.)

Mordecai: Wait. So Muscle Man was fine this whole time?

Muscle Man: (Finishes kissing Starla) I'm as healthy as can be!

Rigby: Then what was all that stuff with Dr. Henry?

Muscle Man: I just had to make sure I was fit enough to keep up with this she-lion. Thanks a ton, you guys, for helping me finish my bucket list.

Benson: (Furious and red) Thanks? I blew 12 grand on you today!

Hi Five Ghost: Do you even know what you put us through?!

Mordecai: Yeah, Muscle Man. We all thought you were gonna die!

Muscle Man: What're you talking about, bro?

Rigby: You had an appointment with Death!

Benson: You had to 'get your papers in order'?

Muscle Man: My toilet papers! I had to fold them into little triangles so my place would look nice for the after-party.

Death: And I'm only here to deliver his aunt's ring from the underworld.

Mordecai: (Arms crossed) Not cool, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: Oh, come on! (Holds a copy of "Metaphors for Becoming A Husband") This is textbook engagement story: you shed your bachelor self before you can get married and be a husband. All that "death" stuff was a metaphor.

Benson: "I leave this world tonight" is not a metaphor!

Muscle Man: (realization hits) Ohhh... Oh, I see what you're saying. Sorry about that.

Rigby: Next time you die, you're on your own! Dude, that is seriously uncool...

(Everyone except for Benson, Fives, Muscle Man, and Starla leave, grumbling.)

Benson: (Sternly) You owe me $12,000. (Walks away)

Muscle Man: (To Fives) You get it, don't you, bro?

(Fives' expression of anger turns into happiness.)

Hi Five Ghost: Best. Proposal. Ever! (Hi-fives Muscle Man)

(End of "The End of Muscle Man")

(The episode starts at Mr. Maellard's Billionaire Brunch. Two guests get a drink as Maellard walks towards them)

Mr. Maellard: And that's what I call liquid assets!

(the female guest laughs)

Male Guest: Maellard, oh boy! Your brunch is the event of the season!

Mr. Maellard: Eh, it's okay. But no brunch would be complete without a little dessert! (he taps his cup with his cane) The most expensive sheet cake in the world!

(a giant sheet cake is being brought in by some guards, it has "$1,000,000" written on it)

Mr. Maellard: If you want to know how much it costs, take a look at the frosting.

(Everybody laughs as Maellard smiles, when suddenly, Rigby comes through the bushes, sleeping on a lawnmower)

Benson: (turning red) RIGBY!!

(Rigby ends up wrecking the cake, getting it splattered all over everybody)

Mr. Maellard: Aarrggh!!!

(Cut to Benson's office)

Rigby: What? I'll buy you a new cake!

Benson: (red and angry) YOU REALLY SCREWED UP THIS TIME!!

Mr. Maellard: Hold on now, Benson! You share as much to blame as he does! You are his manager.

Rigby: It's true, Benson! I told you I needed a nap.

Benson: You were tired because you were up all night PLAYING VIDEO GAMES!

Mr. Maellard: ENOUGH! Rigby's a screwup but discipline starts at the top. So here's what's gonna happen. (he opens a drawer, gets out some paper and a pen) One of you is going to write a letter of resignation by 5 o'clock. Nobody leaves this office until it's done, and if you can't work it out. YOU'RE BOTH FIRED! (he leaves and slams the door)

Benson: This is the last thing I need today! First, my car breaks down and I have to get a ride from my dad. And, now this. All right, Rigby, stop playing around and write that letter.

Rigby: (in the manager's chair) Why should I write it? Didn't you hear? Maellard said it was your fault. 'Cause you mismanaged me!

Benson: Come on, Rigby! We both know this is your fault.

(Rigby reads a book on the desk)

Rigby: Not now, Benson. I'm reading up on my management techniques, there's some really good stuff in here.

(Benson snatches the book away from Rigby)

Rigby: Hey, I was reading that!

(Rigby tries to take the book back)

Benson: Why can't you take anything seriously?

Rigby: Why are you so uptight?!

(The book splits in half as the two fight for it, just before Maellard barges in)

Mr. Maellard: What's going on in here?

(Benson and Rigby mumble. Maellard spots the torn book and takes it away)

Mr. Maellard: Give me that! This isn't "party" time, this is "write a letter to quit" time. And if I have to come back in here, I'm busting heads!

(Maellard storms out)

Rigby: I'm not writing that letter.

(A clock is shown as time flies to 1 o'clock. Rigby sneaks out of the office)

Benson: Rigby, don't you make me come out there! Ugh!

(Benson chases Rigby, who packed a bag on his bed)

Benson: Rigby! If Mr. Maellard catches us out of the room, we're dead!

Rigby: Well then go back so that you won't get caught!

Benson: That's it, Rigby, you march right back- -! (he hears someone coming) Oh, shoot! (hides under the bed)

Mordecai: (comes in with Skips) Rigby, what are you doing here?

Rigby: You can come out now, Benson.

(Benson crawls out of the bed)

Mordecai: Oh hey, Benson.

Benson: Mmm.

Mordecai: I thought Maellard was gonna fire you.

Rigby: (scoffs) Maellard's just bluffing.

(They hear footsteps from the hallway)

Pops: (offscreen) But Papa! You can't fire both of them!

Rigby: Aah!

Benson: Shh! (whispers) We gotta get outta here!

(Benson and Rigby climb out of the window and onto the roof of the house.)

Rigby: Which way is your office?

Benson: Uh... down there!

(They start going around the roof to Benson's office, but Rigby stops Benson when he saw Maellard looking out the window)

Mr. Maellard: (groans) So angry at those two! I think I'll just stare at my beloved park for a few long minutes.

(Rigby and Benson crawl under the window so that Maellard wouldn't see them)

Mr. Maellard: Nah, on second thought, I better check in on them

(On that note, Rigby and Benson quietly gasp in shock before they quickly ran off until they found the window for Benson's office)

Rigby: Oh yeah-yuh!

(Rigby opens the window and goes in the office, but when Benson tried to get in, he slipped on a loose tile and clung onto the window)

Benson: Aah! Rigby, give me a hand!

(Rigby hears the door being knocked on by Mr. Maellard and runs towards it)

Benson: Rigby!

(The door slowly begins to open, only for Rigby to push the door shut and lock it)

Mr. Maellard: What the- -?!

(Rigby grabs Benson's hand and helps pull him up into the office, before hearing Maellard banging on the door again. Rigby opens the door.)

Mr. Maellard: Rigby! What's the meaning of this?!

Rigby: Uh, the door was stuck. I was trying to help. You know, old house.

Mr. Maellard: (suspiciously) Benson?

Benson: (hesitates a little; nervously) Uh... yeah, it does that sometimes. The door... sticks.

(Mr. Maellard looks on suspiciously and closes the door)

Benson: (exhilaratingly) What am I feeling right now? What is this called?!

Rigby: It's called being alive.

Benson: Oh. Well... thanks for helping me.

Rigby: No problem.

(A clock wipe transition to the office. The time is now 2:00. Rigby plays his game on the couch while Benson sits on his desk with his hands on his head in despair)

Benson: Ohhhh, what am I gonna do? This job is my life! Okay, tell you what; if you write this letter, I'll write you a stellar letter of recommendation for your next job.

Rigby: Yeah, Benson, I'll think about it. But I can't think on an empty stomach. (pulls out a box of wings from Wing Kingdom)

Benson: You're not gonna eat those wings cold, are you?

Rigby: Geez, Benson, you're even uptight about how to eat hot wings! (takes a bite of a wing) You'll do a lot better at your next job if you loosen up a bit.

(Benson turns mad, runs toward Rigby and takes the box of wings)

Benson: Gimme that.

Rigby: Hey!

(Benson opens part of his office's floor, which leads to the ceiling ducts, and gets in. Rigby follows him)

Rigby: Benson, wait!

(Cut to Benson and Rigby climbing into the ducts)

Rigby: Where are we going?

Benson: The kitchen, Rigby. We're gonna cook these wings.

Rigby: But I'm fine with eating them cold.

Benson: We're better than that.

Rigby: I'm not!

(They look at the floor of the kitchen from the air vent)

Benson: Looks like the coast is clear.

(Benson opens the kitchen vent and he falls out and lands on his feet, striking a pose. Rigby, however, lands on his stomach)

Rigby: We're just gonna reheat 'em and go, right?

Benson: Yeah.

Rigby: (runs to the door) I'll look out for Maellard.

(Benson opens the kitchen cabinet)

Benson: Now where's the paprika?

Rigby: Are you-- Paprika? Are you kidding?!

(Cut to Benson, already gotten out the things needed to make his own style of the wings, with his apron on. He puts the wings in a bowl)

Rigby: I thought we were just gonna reheat 'em and go.

Benson: Uh, that's what I'm doing... (Looks at Rigby) ...the Benson way. (Winks)

(Rigby slowly turns to the door while Benson imitates an electric guitar riff)

Benson: (singing) Microwave wings, microwave wings. This is Benson's recipe for microwave wings. Dash of pepper, blast of curry, mixing 'em slow-woah, not gonna hurry.

Rigby: What are you singing?

Benson: "Microwave Wings", off of Cournitopia, Heir To The Throne's recipe concept album. It was a huge hit on the Adult Contemporary Prod Rock Soft Metal charts.

Rigby: Never heard of it.

Benson: (singing) Microwave wings, Microwave wings. Where did everybody go after the show? (Puts wings in the box) Benson's on his own again, don't ya know? Benson eats alone. (Puts box in the microwave and sets the timer for 90 seconds) Benson eats alone. (talking) Man, good tune. Weird bridge though.

(Rigby watches Pops and Mr. Maellard running)

Rigby: (gasps) They're coming!

Benson: But the song said it's gotta cook for 90 seconds, and not one second less!

Rigby: I'm bailing! (runs) Get outta my way!

(Episode begins at the Space Tree.)

Colonel Rawls: (Doing push-ups) Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine.(The phone rings, interrupting Rawls' routine. Growling in irritation, he picks it up and answers)

Rawls: Rawls speaking. What's that? Meteor? Heading right towards the Space Tree? Activate space binoculars! (He sits down, looks inside the binoculars and then he sees a face of himself) What in the--? Decrease magnification!

(The space binoculars zooms out to see space bush men pulling their pants down with Rawls' face on their underwear)

Unknown Man: Got you again, Rawls! (Laughs)

Rawls: (Groans) SPACE BUSH!!! 

(cut to Muscle Man in Rawls' office) 

Rawls: Do you know why I brought you here, Muscle Man? 

Muscle Man: If this is about the quantum toilet, it was backed up when I got there. 

Rawls: What? No! This is way bigger than that! I'm talking serious stuff here! I'm talking pranks. 

Muscle Man: Sir? 

Rawls: Allow me to explain. (he brings up a hologram of the man from his watch) This is Carlton Tanner of the Space Bush station: our long-time rivals. He's been pranking me since our days in the academy. So many stink bombs! So many wet willies! I can still feel them in there, squirming around! 

Muscle Man: What does that have to do with me? 

Rawls: I've tried to get back at Tanner for years, but he's just too good! (he switches off the hologram) Muscle Man, I believe you're the greatest prankster in the galaxy! I need you to prank Tanner! 

Muscle Man: What's in it for me, Rawls? 

Rawls: What's in it for you? Equipment! Personnel! The power of the Space Tree at your disposal! And the opportunity to pull off the biggest prank in space history. 

Muscle Man: Pranking in space? I'm in! 

(Muscle Man, High Five Ghost, and Rawls enter the Space Tree's Prank Division, and it is packed with scientists and pranking gear.) 

Muscle Man: Whoa... 

Rawls: Oh, yeah. We don't mess around. (he leads Muscle Man to a scientist examining something through a microscope) How's everything coming, Professor Prankenstein?

Prankenstein: I've told you, it's pronounced Pronk-en-steen! Here, have a look for yourself. (Muscle Man looks through the microscope and sees...) 

Muscle Man: Ugh! It's puke! 

Prankenstein: Correction: FAKE puke! It looks real to the untrained eye, does it not? It even smells like the real thing! (he sniffs it and grows nauseated. He then leads the three over to a table) This is my latest creation. It may not look like much, but when combined with an average dinner mint, it becomes so much more! 

(Muscle Man watches as a robotic arm drops a dinner mint into some green slime. When the mint hits the slime, it begins to expand quickly. He dips his hand and tests the slime, making faces as he does so.) 

Rawls: Does he always do this? 

High Five Ghost: Sh! Don't break his concentration.  

Muscle Man: I got a plan. But I'm gonna need my team to pull it off. 

(In a montage sequence, Muscle Man goes around the Space Tree to recruit the guys. He meets up with Benson and Pops as they hang a cat portrait in the barracks, joins Skips in fixing a space cart, and pops out of a plant Eileen is watering. Chance Sureshot admires himself in a mirror in a room with Toothpick Sally and Recap Robot, noticing Muscle Man in the reflection. Lastly, Mordecai and Rigby are shooting hostile fighter ships in a simulator until Muscle Man pulls the plug. Later, Muscle Man is dressed in a Space Tree uniform and addresses everyone in a meeting room.) 

Muscle Man: Okay, bros. As you may or may not know, the Space Tree has fallen victim to a ruthless prank by the Space Bush. We've been mooned. (Everyone gasps and Mordecai and Rigby laugh) Hey! You wouldn't be laughing if you had a butt staring you in the face! Luckily, I have devised an elaborate prank to put Space Bush in its place. (he switches off the lights and a floating camera acts as a projector) 

Muscle Man: I present to you Operation: Slime Bomb. Props to Mordecai for the sweet graphics. (Mordecai gives him a thumbs-up and Muscle Man starts scrolling through the presentation.) First, we will infiltrate the Space Bush and shut down their force field from the inside, allowing us to easily board their ship. Then we'll go in with these bad boys: fifty-five gallon drums filled with Dr. Prankenstein's secret formula. Each drum is rigged with a timer to give us enough time to drop them off at key points around the ship. Then, we'll make our escape and BOOM! Total slime coverage! And then we celebrate like champs! Any questions? 

Rigby: Uh, that seems pretty complicated. Can't we just moon them back? 

Muscle Man: Who's in charge of this operation? Me, that's who! And if you don't agree with my methods, then you can walk! 

(Later, Muscle Man walks through the underground portion of the Park Dome. Beside him, Fives holds a clipboard.) 

Fives: Everything is in order, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: Good. Systems check. (he approaches Pops, who is stirring a large vat of slime. Muscle Man dips in a ladle to test it.) Keep stirring, Pops. We gotta get the right consistency here. (A loud crash is heard, and Benson cries out near a toppled forklift.) Benson, I thought you knew how to drive this thing! 

Benson: Why?! Why would I know how to drive a space forklift? 

Muscle Man: (throws a book at Benson) Read the manual! I'm sure you'll figure it out. (Next, he comes up to Recap and Sally near some slime drums.) 

Recap Robot: The timer mechanisms are installed as you requested. (Muscle Man measures them and frowns.) 

Muscle Man: Not level. Start over! (he throws the instrument to the ground while Sally groans. Just then, a monitor receives an incoming transmission. Muscle Man answers it.) Commander Rawls?

Rawls: Muscle Man, it's the Space Bush! They're at it again! Look! (he moves the camera to see Tanner and Space Bush members mooning in open space.) How can their bare butts withstand the vacuum of space?! There's no more time, Muscle Man! 

Muscle Man: No time to spare, guys! Time to do this now! 

(cut to a shuttle leaving the Space Tree and a space cart departs. Inside, Mordecai and Rigby are dressed as delivery men with a TV box in the back.) 

Rigby: (rubs his fake moustache) Dude, this could be a good look for me. (Inside the Space Bush, a crew member notices them.) 

Space Bush Personnel: Sergeant Tanner, we have an unknown spacecraft approaching the- AAH! (Tanner gives the man a wet willie.) 

Tanner: HAHAHAHAHA! Oh, don't worry. They won't get past the force field. (The duo's cart bumps into the force field and stops.) 

Mordecai: This better work.

Space Bush Personnel: Welcome, carrier ship. Please state your purpose. 

Mordecai: Uh, we're, uh- (Rigby snatches the communicator from him) 

Rigby: Congratulations! You just won a free flat-screen TV! 

Space Bush Personnel: No, thanks. We've got more flat-screens than we know what to do with here. 

Rigby: Are they ultra-HD? 

Space Bush Personnel: Of course. 

Rigby: Intergalactic channel access? 

Space Bush Personnel: Duh. We're in space. 

Rigby: (nervously) This TV makes pancakes? (The man is quiet for a moment... and a part of the force field opens.) 

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm-hm-hm-hm! (Mordecai flies the ship inside the hangar and unloads the TV box. The duo starts to carry it out and whistle innocently, but are stopped by more Space Bush men.) 

Space Bush Officer: What do you two think you're doing? Only Space Bush personnel past this point! We'll take it from here. (They take the box and leave. As soon as they're gone, Mordecai talks into a wrist communicator.) 

Mordecai: Muscle Man, the package is in the pen. I repeat, the package is in the pen. 

Muscle Man: Phase One complete. Standby. (the men leave the box and Eileen, in a ninja suit, pops out.) 

Eileen: I'm in. (she makes her way to a console and accesses it, coming across a security grid.) Recap, I'm sending the code your way. You take it from here. (she transfers the security data from the Space Bush to the shuttle, disguising herself as a Space Bush officer. On the shuttle, Recap begins hacking into the code.) 

Recap: Code received. Now hacking security system mainframe. (the force field vanishes) Force field down! (feeds of security cameras turn to static and go black, surprising a man.) Surveillance system down! 

Muscle Man: Phase Two complete! Let's roll. (he pushes up on the throttle, flying the shuttle into the hangar. Once aboard, the team splits up into three forklifts carrying slime drums. One holds Benson, Skips, and Pops. Another holds Sureshot, Sally, and Recap. The third holds Mordecai, Fives, and Rigby. Muscle Man holds a laptop and a pack on his back.) 

Muscle Man: Alright, we've got about sixty seconds before they get their systems back online. Everybody head to your assigned drop points! The sooner we dump the slime, the sooner we get to celebration time. (he hops into Mordecai and Rigby's forklift) Now let's move. 

(The forklifts drive out of the shuttle and down three separate hallways. Immediately, an alarm starts blaring.) 

Muscle Man: An alarm? But how? 

Space Bush P.A.: Space Bush security system compromised. Comb the Bush for intruders. (Space Bush personnel walk out of a room with Eileen, having discovered her.) 

Eileen: Muscle Man, they're onto us! You gotta hurry!   

Muscle Man: Copy! (he looks at his laptop to check the team's progress.) Come on! (On the screen, Benson's tracker stops moving.) What? (into communicator) Benson, what's the hold up? (Space Bush personnel detain Benson, Skips, and Pops, their forklift toppled over. Benson's icon vanishes from the screen.) No! Sureshot, gimme your status! (he doesn't get an answer) Sureshot? SURESHOT! (On the other end, Space Bush men have captured Sureshot, Sally, and Recap.) 

Sureshot: Hey, watch the hair! 

(As Sureshot's icon fades away, Muscle Man looks up from the laptop to see fourteen Space Bush men blocking their way.) 

Mordecai: Ah! (He brings the forklift to a stop. He looks behind him for an opportunity to escape, but sees more men block them off from behind. They all run towards the forklift.) 

Muscle Man: I've gotta set this thing off manually! (he jumps for the drum, but falls and is swarmed by the men. The screen cuts to black.) 

(Some time later, the team is placed in handcuffs and is back in the hangar.) 

Tanner: Well, well. So this is the infamous Muscle Man. I gotta say, I expected more from Rawls. Looks to me he got an amateur to run this operation! 

Muscle Man: Don't be so sure of yourself. You may find that I'm full of surprises. (he takes out a remote and arms a slime drum for thirty seconds) In a few seconds, you and your whole Space Bush are gonna be covered head to toe in slime! 

Tanner: (in mock surprise) Huh? Did you hear that, everyone? (he walks up to the drum) Muscle Man is going to slime the Space Bush! What are we gonna do? I'm so scared! (Tanner takes out a pair of scissors and cuts the wires to the timer when one second remains. Everyone gasps.) 

Rigby: You can do that?! 

Tanner: Ha ha ha! Aw, don't be so glum. It's not like the whole Space Tree was counting on you or anything. (he chuckles) Now, you have two choices. You and your friends can either rot in the Space Bush jail... (his men raise their laser guns) Or you can admit that I am the best prankster in the galaxy! What's it gonna be? 

(A nervous Muscle Man looks over his friends in hesitation, groaning.) 

Muscle Man: You're the greatest. 

Tanner: What was that?

Muscle Man: You're the greatest prankster. 

Tanner: I can't hear you!. 

Muscle Man: YOU'RE THE GREATEST PRANKSTER IN THE GALAXY! (he falls to his knees, sobbing) 

Tanner: Well, then. As the greatest prankster in the galaxy, I feel like I owe myself a little reward. (he opens Muscle Man's pack and takes out the celebratory bottle) Now get these Space Tree hacks off my bush! 

Space Bush Personnel: (salutes) Yes, sir! Off your bush, sir! 

Tanner: Oh, and Muscle Man... (Muscle Man looks up as two men take him) Cheers! 

(On the shuttle, Muscle Man stares out into space with defeat. The shuttle flies back to the Space Tree and head into Rawls' office, where Rawls learns of the mission's outcome. Muscle Man hangs his head low.) 

Rawls: UNACCEPTABLE! Do you realize how much I invested into this operation?! (a tear falls from Muscle Man's face) I thought you were a master prankster! 

(On the Space Bush, Tanner holds a victory party with Muscle Man's bottle and his men cheer.) 

Tanner: And now, we toast! To the best prankster in the galaxy, me! Hahaha! Now crack this baby open so we can celebrate! (the men cheer again)

Rawls: I hope you're proud of yourself, because you're a FAILURE! 

Muscle Man: (with a knowing look) Am I? 

(The Space Bush crew member rips open the bottle's cover... and sees that it is a bottle-shaped slime bomb with five seconds remaining on the timer. The crew members gasp.) 

Space Bush Personnel: Uh... sir? (Tanner walks over and sees the bomb with one second remaining) 

Tanner: Oh, no... (the timer hits zero, dinner mints drop into the bottle, and slime expands across the Space Bush. At the Space Tree, Rawls watches through his space binoculars.) 

Rigby: We got 'em! (the guys cheer and Rawls turns to Muscle Man in disbelief) 

Rawls: Well, I'll be darned! Muscle Man, you sneaky so-and-so! I never should've doubted you! 

Muscle Man: You're right, you shouldn't have. Now, if you'll excuse me... (With "Ode to Joy" playing, he drops his pants and presses his butt against the window. A picture of Tanner's face is on his underwear as he moons the Space Bush. On the Space Bush, Tanner and his men see the whole thing while squished against the window from the slime.) 

Tanner: Oh... he really is the best! 

(End of "Ugly Moons") 

(Mordecai is struggling to insert a lightbulb into a lampost)

Mordecai: It won't go in.

Rigby: No, dude, you're doing it wrong! Righty-tighty-lefty-loosey! Not lefty-tighty-mess it up, because you're a loser.

(Benson is seen holding the ladder)

Benson: Would you guys hurry up? It's been a whole hour! I can't believe you can't even put in a simple lightbulb.

Mordecai: Almost got it... [finishes it off, badly] ...Bam!

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAAA! [zoom into the loose lightbulb]

Benson: THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT!!! Here, get down and hold the ladder. [Mordecai & Rigby do so, then, Benson climbs] I'll do it. [begins to insert it properly] I have to do everything around here.

Rigby: Dude, Benson, what's the rush? It's not like you have somewhere to be.

Benson: Yeah, actually, I do. I do have a life outside of work, you know.

Rigby: Yeah, right. Where are you gonna go, Benson?

Mordecai: Yeah, where are you gonna go, dude?

Benson: JUST HOLD THE LADDER!!!

Rigby: Come on, man! Spill it! Where you gonna go?

Mordecai: Dude, Rigby, leave him alone! Can't you tell you're annoying him?

Rigby: [slaps Mordecai] No, you're annoying him!

Mordecai: No, you're annoying him!

Rigby: No, you're annoying him!

Mordecai and Rigby: You're annoying him!

Benson: [shaking on top of the ladder] Hold the ladder!

Mordecai and Rigby: Waugh!

Mordecai: Benson! Benson! [grabs the knocked-out Benson] Oh, man, please don't be dead... He's still breathing. He's just unconscious.

Rigby: What are we gonna do? He's totally gonna fire us when he wakes up!

Mordecai: Dude, cool it. I gotta think. [pause] Okay. We only have one chance at not getting fired.

Rigby: Okay. I'll go get the shovel.

Mordecai: No, dude. We have to take him back to his place and put him in bed, and hope he doesn't remember that any of this happened.

Rigby: What? That'll never work!

Mordecai: It's our only hope. Either he remembers and he fires us, or he doesn't and he doesn't. Either way, it's our only chance not to get fired.

Rigby: Okay. I guess that makes sense.

Mordecai: Dude, hurry up.

Rigby: Maybe If I had a little help this would go faster. [grunting] His gumballs must be made of lead! Okay, he's in, let's go. [Mordecai starts the cart. Soon, Benson falls out of it and onto the road]

Rigby: Augh!

Mordecai: Benson!

Mordecai: Dude, he looks horrible.

Rigby: Wait, I got it. [grabs sunglasses from cart and puts them over Benson's eyes]

Mordecai: Ugh, we're so fired.

Rigby: But he looks so chill.

Muscle Man: Hey, Benson.

Rigby: Agh! It's Muscle Man!

Mordecai: [gasps] We can't let him find out. [starts cart]

Muscle Man: Hey, I want to talk to Benson!

Rigby: Whoo! That was close. [Muscle Man is seen running behind the cart]

Muscle Man: Wait, I want to talk! [Mordecai & Rigby take a sharp turn] TALK!!!

Rigby: [looks back] We lost him. [Muscle Man jumps out from behind the bushes]

Muscle Man: Hey! [Mordecai gasps and stops the cart] Didn't you hear me calling you?

Mordecai: [nervously] Oh...hey, Muscle Man. How's it going?

Muscle Man: What do you ladies care? Benson, I took care of those kids with the snakes like you asked.

Rigby: You ran for that?

Muscle Man: Oh, yeah. Thanks for the smooth jazz concert tickets. My date tonight is going to be extra hot! How did you know she was going to go crazy for it? [Mordecai takes Benson's hand and waves it in the air] It's going to be on tonight!

Rigby: People like jazz?

Muscle Man: Whatever, loser. You just don't know what the ladies like. Right, Benson? [Mordecai waves Benson's hand and points it, and Muscle Man runs off] WHOOO-WHO! You know it! [Benson's head hits the cart]

Mordecai: This is Benson's apartment. We're almost there, dude. [reaches for the knob. Right then, a girl named Audrey opens the door behind them]

Audrey: Benson! [Mordecai & Rigby notice] Where have you been? My party started two hours ago. Everything okay? [Mordecai shakes Benson to appear as if he is nodding] Oh, great! Come on in and join the party!

Mordecai: No! Uh... I mean, Benson's had a pretty exhausting day at work. He's not really in a partying mood right now. Right, Benson? [Mordecai & Rigby shake Benson again to simulate nodding]

Audrey: But, you said you were gonna come. We planned this over a month ago, remember? [Mordecai & Rigby shrug Benson's shoulders. Audrey sighs] Okay. You're a busy guy and you work a lot, I understand. I was just really hoping you could come to my party. I see you walking down the hall all the time but I never get to talk to you. I thought maybe we could have a chance to get to know each other better. Well, see you. [closes door]

Rigby: Nag nag nag! Alright, let's get him to bed.

Mordecai: Wait dude, we have to take Benson to this party.

Rigby: What?! Why?

Mordecai: Dude. Didn't you see how disappointed that girl was? Benson really did have somewhere to be and we totally messed it up for him! We owe him this.

Rigby: Big deal, he's still gonna fire us.

Mordecai: Dude, if we take him to the party and he wakes up, he'll just think he partied too hard and won't even remember what happened!

Rigby: Hey, maybe you're right! And there'll be witnesses too! Then we'll be off the hook!

Mordecai: Then what do you say, Benson? You ready to party? [pause] I'll take that as a yes!

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAAA!

Rigby: Oh.

Mordecai: Dude, I thought you had him!

[Begin a mini-montage of Mordecai & Rigby partying with a knocked-out Benson. Mordecai & Rigby scan the room before partying. Mordecai controls Benson to high-five two hipsters, followed by Mordecai & Rigby controlling Benson to dance]

Audrey: I can't believe we haven't hung out before this! [puts hand next to Benson] I'm so glad you can hang out tonight. [Mordecai pushes Benson's hand on top of Audrey's. A man named Chuck watches in anger]

Chuck: Yo! [walks up to Audrey] Yo Audrey, who's the jerkface?

Audrey: Chuck, please! Benson does not have the face of a jerk. And I can talk to whoever I want. We're not dating anymore, remember?

Chuck: I guess so. I just never knew you liked talking to losers. [laughs and pokes Benson repeatedly] You hear that, loser?

Audrey: Stop it Chuck, Benson is not a loser!

Chuck: Oh yeah? Well if he not a loser then why is he letting me do this? [pokes Benson]

Audrey: I don't know.

Chuck: [pokes Benson] Why are you letting me poke your face like this? [laughs. Mordecai grabs Benson's hand and slaps Chuck with it, sending water into his face. The sound of a stopping record is heard as everyone else gasps] Not cool, shades. You think you can drop H2O on the FE and get away with it?

Rigby: The FE?

Chuck: Ever seen the periodic table, loser? [points to shirt] FE is the abbreviation for iron, like my stomach. I'm the iron stomach! [grabs a hot chili and eats it]

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmhmph! Hmph! Hmph!

Mordecai: [turns Benson's head] What's that Benson? You think Chuck's a chump and you're not scared?

Rigby: [turns Benson's head] Really, Benson? Are you sure? Okay, whatever you say, you're the boss. [grabs two hot chilis and throws them in Benson's mouth]

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAAA!

Chuck: Fine then. Let's dance.

[Clock transition to Chuck and Benson having a chili duel. Chuck eats a handfull of jalapeños as everyone cheers]

Chuck: Top that.

Rigby: What's that, Benson? You wanna wash that down with some chili flakes?

Mordecai: Looks like the FE is just L-A-M-E. [crowd cheers]

Audrey: Go Benson!

Chuck: Fine. You think you're so hot? [pours out chocolate sauce, soy sauce, mayonnaise, kimchi, pasta sauce, clams and sushi into a giant glass, puts in a miniature umbrella, and passes it to Benson] How about a victory drink? I call it the Mississippi Queen.

Rigby: Mississippi Queen? Why do you call it that?

Chuck: Oh, you'll find out.

Crowd: Drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Drink it!

Mordecai: Bottom's up...

(Mordecai & Rigby lift the glass up to Benson's mouth. Right then, the smell of the Mississippi Queen wakes Benson up.)

Benson: What the? [gags] Mordecai, Rigby! [Mordecai & Rigby cover Benson's mouth] 

Benson: Both of you better tell me what's going on right now or-- [stomach rumbles] Oh, my stomach... Oh, my mouth! My mouth is on fire! [goes to the sink and drinks the water] How did I even get here?

Rigby: You mean you don't remember us knocking you out? [Benson spits out the water from his mouth, onto the mirror, as Mordecai punches Rigby.]

Benson: You what?!

Mordecai: Look, Benson, before you say anything, we were gonna take you home but then we ran into your neighbor and she really wanted you to go to her party. So we brought you and now you're in a huge eating match against her ex-boyfriend.

Rigby: But it's cool, 'cause you're totally beating him and--

Benson: [off-screen] That's it. [on-screen] You guys are so unbelievably fi--

Crowd: [outside] Benson! Benson! [looks outside and sees Audrey] Benson! Benson! Benson! Benson!

Mordecai: Look, Benson. You could go ahead and fire us, or you could go out there and really impress Audrey. Your choice, man.

Crowd: Benson! Benson! [looks at Audrey again] Benson! Benson! Benson! Benson! Benson! Benson!

Benson: Come with me.

Benson: I'm gonna drink this. [crowd cheers]

Mordecai: [drowned out] Alright, yeah!

Benson: And so are my two buddies, Mordecai and Rigby. [crowd cheers. Mordecai & Rigby are shocked] Or they're fired.

Mordecai and Rigby: Huh?

Benson: Bottom's up, fellas. [the crowd chants "go" as Mordecai, Rigby & Benson chug down the Mississippi Queen. When they finish, they start coughing]

Mordecai: Huh. That wasn't actually that bad.

Benson: Yeah, I didn't really taste anything.

Rigby: Yo, Chuck! Your Mississippi queen was Mississippi lame!

Mordecai: Yeah, it's not even spicy at all.

Chuck: Yeah, well that's called beginner's luck. Luck. Luck. Luck. Luck...

Mordecai: Feels like rush hour in my lower intestines...

Rigby: I don't think I've ever eaten so much food in my life. [Benson gets up. A note is attached to him]

Benson: That's it. I've had it with you two. I can't even get knocked out without you guys ruining my social life by getting me into stupid food challenges.

Rigby: B-but Benson, we won! [makes a fart noise] Didn't we?

Benson: Won? I would've never gotten into this mess if you two weren't always messing around. You two are fired! No more chances, just get out of here.

Mordecai: [gasps] Benson! Look!

Benson: What? [pulls off paper attached to him. It reads, Call Me, 555-0155. <3 Audrey]

Mordecai: What does it say?

Rigby: Yeah man, what does it say?

Benson: Ah. [to M&R] Get back to work.

(Episode begins in outer space. The dome-sealed park rocket comes into view. The guys and Eileen are groaning.)

Sureshot: Looks like the newbies can't handle lightspeed, allow me to introduce you to my compatriots. Toothpick Sally, Recap Robot...

Recap Robot: Hello, hi.

Sureshot: And yours truly, Chance Sureshot. (Twirls his blaster and drops it) We're here. That's the Space Tree, home.

Guys: Whoa.

Rigby: Check out all the other domes.

(The park dome lands in an empty spot, cut to Col. Ralws' office)

Col. Rawls: You left these new recruits drifting for how long?!

Sureshot: Uh, maybe 2 days.

Col. Rawls: 2 days?! If you were on time, maybe they wouldn't have been boarded by Reaper bots. Real rookie maneuver, Sureshot. Now get down and give me 300, you miserable sack of space puke.

Sureshot: Uh, yes sir. (Gets down and starts doing push-ups)

Col. Rawls: Ahem, as for the rest of you, welcome to space, I'm Colonel Rawls, insert pleasantries here.

Benson: Hi. Benson here, quick question, WHAT IS GOING ON?!

(Cut to everyone watching an initiation video)

Male voice: Congrats, new domers. You have been selected to take part in the next frontier in recreation, the SPARK Initiative.

Benson: Spark? (gasp) space park.

Rigby: Shh.

Male voice: Our operatives on Earth determined you would be a good fit for this mission. Over the next few months, this space station will be your home, you'll train with the best from around the world, then you'll be sent off on your own to explore pristine space wilderness so that this can become this. After that, you'll go to the [BLEEP] system, where you'll protect [BLEEP] as you arrive at [BLEEP]

Col. Rawls: (Runs in front of the screen) Uh, that's classified for now, so who's jazzed about this? (Everyone but Benson cheers) I see one guy who isn't jazzed.

Benson: So we're being forced to do this?

Col. Rawls: Well, this is purely a volunteer mission to benefit mankind.

Benson: Well I don't volunteer. (He leaves the room)

Col. Rawls: That's different.

Eileen: Why can't Benson see that this is gonna be really cool?

Skips: He's afraid to try something new.

Pops: The park wouldn't be the same without him.

Rigby: We gotta get him on board.

(Cut to the barracks)

Sureshot: And this here's the Barracks.

Rigby: Cool, bunk beds.

Mordecai: Benson, check it out cool pillows.

Benson: Those pillows are not cool at all and neither is space.

Eileen: Actually, Benson, I hate to disagree, but living in space is the definition of cool. I mean, I just got goosebumps saying that.

Benson: Um, again; basically kidnapped and forced to do this.

Rigby: What's the matter, Benson? You can have top bunk if you want.

Benson: (Sarcastically) Oh, the top bunk, now I definitely wanna stay in space. (To Muscle Man) Muscle Man, what about Starla?

Muscle Man: Starla would be proud, Besides, I know our love will stand the test of time. (He holds up a picture of him and Starla signed "Our love will stand the test of time. Starla" and kisses the photo)

Benson: Well, Fives, what about Celia?

Hi-Five Ghost: Ditto. (Pulls out a photo of him and Celia signed "Ditto -Celia")

Benson: I can't believe you people! Those scientists lied to us. MR. MAELLARD LIED TO US!! UGH, I WANNA GO HOME!!! (He storms out)

Skips: This is gonna be harder than we thought.

(Sensory-compromise) Let's do my favorite one!

(A montage follows where a battle is taking place in the park. Benson and Rigby are fighting the Redeemer while Rigby is at the grocery store)

Benson: Benson, don't let down the Redeemer, you have your chance!

(Scene cuts to The Park and Benson is at the phone)

Benson: So you're all ready to meet this...

(Mordecai and Rigby start to message Benson, but Benson doesn't reply. M&R laugh at Rigby's response.)

(Suddenly, they hear the voice of the Redeemer yelling in a phone)

Benson: This is Benson, right? Benson, come quick! Do you have something to say?

(Door opens, Benson walks inside)

Benson: Are you alright?

(Door closes. Benson looks at Rigby and Mordecai)

Rigby: Dude, why the heck, Benson, don't you guys see why Benson isn't gonna listen?

(They hear another voice)

Rigby: Look Rigby, your voice is different. It's like a different voice from the rest of the group. You know, like, "Don't trust me!"

(Scene cuts to The Park and the phone, Benson walks to Rigby)

Rigby: I think it's Rigby. Did you hear?

Mordecai: Yeah, Rigby. Rigby, you're really going through something! This whole fight is for nothing, Benson. You're a bad mannered bastard!

Rigby: Oh?

Benson: Yeah, it's not. Look, I'm sorry it took so long to clear up. We're not going to get back to the parking lot until they're all cleared up. Come on, let's get something out, okay?

(Benson walks to a computer)

Benson: Alright. Let me get this computer. Let's go get it to show all the ways to the red circle.

(Benson walks back up into the parking lot on the computer and checks the buttons on the computer, and clicks on the red arrow)

Rigby: Yeah!

Rigby: OK, okay!

(Benson walks back up into the computer, and checks the buttons on the computer, and clicks on the red arrow, and rolls the computer on one of the levers, again.)

Mordecai: What's going on?

Rigby: Something like this happened. So, I'm gonna go check it out.

Mordecai: So what?

(Rigby checks the triggers, and they all start hitting the red circle, causing it to go back into the red circle and continue hitting until it explodes like a ton of bricks on a platform on the red circle)

Benson: Let me know if you need anything. [runs to Rigby and Rigby holds Rigby for Benson's hand] Rigby, let me help you, buddy. Just this one thing. A bit dirty.

Rigby: Aw, what?

Rigby: A bit dirty.

(A blue light appears from above, and the two light blueprints come out of the blueprints)

Rigby: Oh, this is it. A new blueprint, Rigby. A blueprint! A blueprint for not-so-cleansing out the streets of Benson.

Benson: That's it?

Rigby: Oh dear! That's it!

Benson: Look, I need your help! I can't wait to have you join me in my hunt for the Red Heart. Well? [runs up to Rigby and Rigby gets carried away] What do you have to say about this?

Rigby: No, no, don't! That's just the way it is. You know, the "I don't think I'm ever going to be able to finish this" kind of thing.

Mordecai: What now?

Rigby: Well, we didn't have to go that far. You know, like, you know, like, let me see. Or maybe if we're off-topic, I won't notice. But we have to get that "I don't like Benson" sign out and make it.

Benson: Okay!

(Rigby looks like he made it, but it still exploded like a ton of bricks on the platform and onto Benson's platform)

Rigby: Why did it explode like that? Why did you say you wouldn't?

Benson: (laughs)

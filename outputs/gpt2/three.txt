Bert: Dude, who's the real culprit? The kid's so smart!

(They all jump into something and they start getting hit by something in the living room. Mordecai is caught by the dust but his body falls out of the way to Mordecai and Rigby get out of the way.)

Mordecai: Dude, he got me?

Rigby: Dude, he was just trying to hurt my mother? (Pushes Mordecai on the edge of the couch)

Mordecai: I can't make it out! It's just the dust and we should go to the bathroom, or I'm gonna get a fresh one!

Rigby: Yeah, come on, dude. We should just clean it up.

Mordecai: Dude, we need to check it.

Rigby: Yeah, we're gonna need some kind of sort of special solution.

(Mordecai opens the door slowly while Rigby screams that he is gonna die)

Mordecai: Dude, it's not the dust and the dust, bro! We should just remove it.

(Rigby goes to the living room to get a cure)

Rigby: Dude, this must be special!

Mordecai: (Wins) Yeah, dude.

Rigby: Just follow the instructions.

Mordecai: (Looks around) Hey, Rigby.

Rigby: What are you doing?

Mordecai: I'm trying to clean up when the dust gets in me, just like I should have been cleaning up the place...when my mom always was clean.

Rigby: So, how are you supposed to clean it off with it?

Mordecai: I should be able to wash it off with my hands.

Rigby: No. You don't.

Mordecai: I am pretty good at that.

Rigby: Yeah, I should be able to do it.

Mordecai: Dude, this must be special.

Rigby: Just follow the instructions to clean it off.

Mordecai: Uh, Rigby.

Rigby: Here.

(Mordecai is now doing a lot of dirty laundry. Mordecai gasps)

Rigby: We'll take care of it.

(Mordecai runs out of the living room)

Mordecai: Aw, man! It's real, man.

Rigby: Hey! Let's go!

Mordecai: Wait! I don't think I can help you. You have to clean it off. (Pumps together a piece of cardboard with a little glue on it. The box breaks and they go back to cleaning it off. They pull it up and clean the contents of the box) Hmm. Hey, can I go to the bathroom for you?

Rigby: I don't have the time, man!

Mordecai: Hey, we gotta get this guy to the bathroom. You gotta go to the bathroom!

Rigby: No, dude. I didn't think you could. And I know I can't let this dude go!

Mordecai: Dude, what do we do?

Rigby: You know, you know, you gotta clean it up.

Mordecai: Dude, I thought we had a better idea.

Rigby: Oh, man, this was a bad idea. You'd be better off doing something else.

Mordecai: That was all my thought. That was all my thought. I could do it.

Rigby: What?

Muscle Man: Rigby, you had a plan.

Rigby: I'm gonna throw a party, and when we get there, you'll join me at the party. Here, let's start our new party.

(Mordecai opens the refrigerator and is about to leave it. The fridge buzzes and he is about to do a little of the dirty laundry he has to do. Rigby then throws all the boxes onto Rigby's body.)

Rigby: Aw, what?

Mordecai: Come on, give up!

Mordecai: Get off me!

(They pull Rigby's arm out of his waistband and back into his hands)

Mordecai: Dude, he's gonna kick my butt.

Rigby: Awwww, wait!

Mordecai: Dude

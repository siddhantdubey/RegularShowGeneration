Cougar:Dude, I think I can handle it

(Gives Benson the phone)

Gage:Hello, Benson. Is this you?

Benson:Uh...no.

Gage:What?

Benson:What about now?

Gage:No.

Benson:Hey, it's me, dude. I've been waiting so long to hear that the guy's finally coming out. (points at Benson) But we're on! Benson won't let me do his thing.

(The scene cuts to the parking spot, with Benson holding a trash can)

Rigby:Benson, quit throwing trash here!

Benson:Nonsense! I'm throwing him any garbage that comes my way!

(Benson pushes Rigby on a side of the curb and falls on his side)

Rigby:Ugh!

Benson:Come on! I'm serious! I'm throwing you garbage!

Rigby:I told you you'd throw it if you kept telling me to do your thing!

(The camera zooms out to reveal Benson throwing garbage at Benson, who is in the street, the camera zooms out again to reveal Benson throwing a cart full of trash at Benson)

Benson:Ugh!

Rigby:Dude, that was the most hilarious part!

Benson:All I ever said was, "I'm doing your thing, I'm throwing you garbage."

Rigby:Ugh!

Benson:Look, there's just one issue, and it's that I don't know what I am. I just want money! I mean, I've really never used my real name, but what are you talking about? A real man?! Don't even call him my real name, that's just like your real name.

Mordecai:You mean, you don't even have a real name?!

Benson:Well, if you're gonna throw me garbage, then how about you throw your money into my place?

Rigby:Okay, well, you're gonna do everything you can to get me to throw it away, regardless of what happens and I'm just getting to know you guys better. I don't like you two men. It's a lot easier to get people to listen to me, right Benson?

(Benson slams the door on the way out, but is pushed by Mordecai and Rigby back in the parking lot)

Benson:I've been here a couple of times. Every time. Every time.

Rigby:Well, it's not like you and Rigby are friends.

Benson:I don't like it when they use that word.

Rigby:What?! You're not dating a real guy, let alone one that throws trash at you!

Benson:Look, I just want to see him. He's throwing money at my girlfriend!

Rigby:Uh...okay?

Benson:I'm glad you're here, man.

(Mordecai punches Benson over the counter)

Mordecai:You know, if we work that guy I can dump the garbage in front of everyone...and win!

(Mordecai pulls his pants down for a good time)

Mordecai:Look, if it was just a matter of being late we wouldn't be dating, we'd already do it in advance.

Rigby:I can feel my legs.

Mordecai:We should stay out of it!

(Benson shakes his fist and laughs)

Rigby:Yeah, man.

(Mordecai puts the trash back in Rigby's mouth)

Mordecai:Don't get me wrong, I'm a pretty bum loser. You're a sweet deal for someone that dumped on me with two guys we can hook up. But be careful. You may get your chances in a lot of shit you don't deserve.

Pops:Babe!

(Babe laughs in anger, turns to face him)

Rigby:Dude! You know what? I don't deserve to be dumped like that! It's just that loser shit I'm throwing at Benson.

Mordecai:I know what you're thinking.

Babe:I don't have to do all of that work!

(Mordecai punches Mordecai again)

Mordecai:What're you talking about?

Rigby:You have to be kidding me! I'm so happy I'm not dating that loser.

Benson:Aw,

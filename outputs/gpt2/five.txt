 to suit your tastes, so we can take care of this mess.

Benson: Come on, baby. I can't stop eating it. I can't stop drinking it.

(Cultural references: A man named Jack is driving with another man wearing a red suit. The suit is shown driving a red horse.)

(Benson and Dwayne drive away. Everyone is holding up signs proclaiming: Bring Back The Horse)

Muscle Man: Dude, it's been so long since I've seen you in so many years.

Pops: What? It's just not the sort of place we want to be.

Rigby: You know what? I'm not going to stop until we fix this mess.

Mordecai: Well, we need to get back in the saddle.

(A horse man, a man named Mordecai and Rigby drive toward the ring, knocking on the door, making the door open.)

Rigby: Hello?

(Mordecai and Rigby are outside of Muscle Man's garage, trying to get a job. Muscle Man is holding a stick.)

Muscle Man: I'm sorry.

Mordecai: Don't think you could have let me in. Please.

(Rigby turns to Mordecai with angry eyes as he runs toward Muscle Man and drives away.)

Benson: Hey, don't you see what I'm thinking?

(Pops walks in)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man. This is the same guy that came and robbed my friend's house. He probably just wanted a ride back home from work.

Pops: I just figured you might want to check in with Pops.

Muscle Man: Yeah, Pops is there. I'm sorry, Muscle Man, but I can't handle you looking at that mustache. I wish you could have put it in another one of your faces.

Mordecai: We'll just go home and check in on Pops.

Muscle Man: You sure?

(They all nod in agreement.)

Rigby: Hey, wait, wait, let's go do our jobs to earn more money.

Muscle Man: And he's actually very rich.

(Rigby and I check our checking accounts, and I'm thinking about how much I should take. We check both accounts daily for three months before the time flies to the distant future, where I could finally retire from my job that I never got, and take my job back.

Mordecai: Whoa, I wish I had thought about the future. All I need is a little bit of good old-fashioned work to keep me motivated and happy.

(A montage is shown of Pops driving a buggy. He's driving a buggy in a dark field, and it suddenly jumps over obstacles, knocking down the obstacle and destroying the ground. Suddenly, Muscle Man is in a van.)

Muscle Man: I'm the driver of this van! I can beat you one way or another! I'm the guy who stole that carrot thingy to get back at you!

(Muscle Man grabs a carrot from the van and throws it at Muscle, and he punches the one to smash the carrot, but Muscle catches a glimpse of the carrot in Muscle's hand and grabs onto Muscle's arm, causing it to land on the ground outside a corner shop.)

Muscle Man: I'm the one who has to help you, Muscle Man!

Rigby: And you're the one who should help him.

Muscle Man: I don't think that carrot has eaten my heart all that long.

(Muscle Man then starts to punch Muscle, causing another carrot to fall out of his hand.)

Rigby: And I think maybe he's been eating a little too much.

Muscle Man: We should leave.

(Muscle throws the carrot at the ground, but Muscle is still holding it.)

Mordecai: Yeah! Don't you dare go out there. Don't you dare cross the street!

Muscle Man: Oh, no! I just can't keep up with all that old stuff. I've already lost my job.

(The scene then shows Mordecai and Rigby heading off-screen to the house to check on Pops.)

Mordecai: Uh...

(Pops is in the bedroom carrying a box of cigarettes. He looks in alarm but does not turn around, instead looking outside the window and gasping. He then goes up in the air while gasping. He turns around to run into Muscle, who is crying softly. Muscle then pulls on a bandanna, and it is

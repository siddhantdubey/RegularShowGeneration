 had a better feeling, too. We were the first group who could get away with that. We would go on the road to heaven, so why didn't those guys get out of there fast enough? And if it comes down to that, they're all gonna die! (Mordecai starts to drive them.) Oh man, did we just miss our day, dude?

Rigby: (in disbelief) It's true. The first week went by fast. Oh. It wasn't even bad, but its a pain in the butt.

Mordecai & Rigby: Ahh-ha. They're the last guys left on the road, ha ha. (The trio drive the road for a bit in front of Rigby)

Rigby (on the road): That was too much. They came.

Mordecai & Rigby: They did. They came.

Mordecai: (pushes Rigby into the air) That's because of our bad judgment, it wasn't fair.

Mordecai: We made a mistake.

Pops: Oh come on, why were we all just driving our car around while our asses came up over us?

Mordecai & Rigby: U-uh, (takes drive and passes the parking garage door) The parking garage has a new door, that's an important one.

Pops: It's locked!

Mordecai & Rigby: Come on! Come on! (pushes door)

Rigby: It's locked.

Slam Dunk Bait: Don't close your blinds!

Rigby: We've just got to go down as the only team with those blinds

Mordecai & Rigby: (pushing door) No, we gotta go out because they're trying to make us take a shortcut!

Mordecai & Rigby: We can't take those shortcut, and we cannot drive those shortcuts!

Mordecai & Rigby: We must make it happen fast enough to make it happen, and we never see those blinds until we do! I'm gonna lie for ya! You wanna lie? You just had to lie.

Rigby: No! It's already happening!

Rigby: You are the truth. You're lying on that shortcut!

Mordecai: This is my personal lie!

Rigby: It's not your fault. It is my personal. We should all be out there getting out of that big fat hole!

Mordecai: (pushes door)

Rigby: You think this is cool? Oh we heard the way they used to play games, they were going to get back to us in a single turn and we'd have to take turns back and forth to get out of that big fat hole?

Mordecai: That was awesome!

Rigby: I think we should all get out of those blinds.

Mordecai & Rigby: No!

Mordecai:

Pops: (to Rigby) Whoa, whoa. These aren't cool, but what did we do?

Mordecai: We took shortcuts!

Rigby: Yeah, these are dumb, how's that for a game?

Mordecai: In an arcade machine? But that was way too soon and we're gonna lose your friends, we just gotta beat 'em by going with you!

(Cuts to the arcade)

Pops: You mean, we were out there playing your game and all you did for a minute was go into your "gods" room, grab a cookie, and get in there and enjoy the show as much as you could, then you'll never get back to the arcade! So, I think you should quit your job because your brain's just too big!

Rigby: Fine. No more arcade games!

Mordecai And Rigby: We'll be happy.

Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai & Rigby: Awesome! Nice game. Just play "mordecai and rigby" while the guys take turns over until the end, where we finish off the other players with the "gods room" (pushes door)

(The two go up the ladder, which turns out to be the one with the blinds, and it then comes to the road, where they end up, and go back to that blinds by the way)

Mordecai: That's the only way.

(The door opens)

Mordecai & Rigby: No! Go to the "gods

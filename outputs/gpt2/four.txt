Pops: (laughs) Yes, I've seen your face before.

Mordecai: No way.

Rigby: I'd like to shake your hands and thank you.

(Pops shows a sad pose which I can't believe that.)

Rigby: Oh, and I'm afraid it was my sister.

Pops: That is true, but I am sorry for messing it up.

Rigby: But thanks once again.

(Pops then sees the sad pose on the wall, the sad pose on the couch, the sad pose on the phone, the tragic pose on the phone.)

Pops: (shocked) That's my sister, Mordecai, Mordecai, you are my friend. It's not that bad, but I think we'll need that in our relationship.

Mordecai: You still have a problem with my face all the time?

(he goes to a mirror, and sees a sad pose on it. He sighs while thinking.)

Mordecai: (shocked) And this is the end of that?

Rigby: What are you talking about, bro? (laughs) I'm sorry if it seems like I'm going too overboard or something.

(He looks at Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing?!

(He turns to look at Rigby as Mordecai and Rigby run to him.)

Rigby: We need to meet somebody else, and I think that was gonna be you guys.

Mordecai: We got someone else already.

Rigby: Uh... (sees Mordecai) Are you okay with that?

(he sees the funny looking faces on his face, and a sad looking face as he continues walking away.)

Mordecai: Mordecai.

Rigby: Dude, look! I mean who are you? (starts running away from M&R)

Mordecai: (shocked) Why are you acting so sad?

(Rigby stops running and looks at Mordecai that way.)

Mordecai: Dude, look at this.

Rigby: Why are you so so sad? It's not my face, man. I just... I just know it. I just want it back.

Mordecai: But you didn't know!

Rigby: Oh, come on. If you want to meet someone else that has a sad face, you gotta meet someone else with a bad face!

Mordecai: You know how to meet someone else. Maybe I am a bad face.

(He takes out the phone and puts it on a computer and he starts sending things to the other faces of the others.)

Mordecai: M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M. (he's looking for them again)

(He calls out the names of his friends and tells the phone the names of others with sad faces and tries to get the phone number.)

Mordecai: Dude, wait! I mean I'm still a mess.

Man: How does this work?

Benson: Well, we'll do it in person after the party. Then you two come and meet someone else. Good luck there, friend.

(He sees that Mordecai and Rigby are in there, but then runs after them again before he finds a message saying "Mordecai and Rigby have come. Call back at some point.")

Mordecai: No!

(He looks out to see the faces he sees next when he looks in the message.)

Mordecai: Dude, Mordecai, Rigby!

(He grabs Rigby's arm, and kicks him out of the way before getting back at the computer and sees that it had been reset to a different part of the house.)

Mordecai and Rigby: WOOO!

(Rigby screams and runs back out the door. In the phone message, Rigby's name is listed in the phone book and when Rigby comes back, Mordecai opens the phone message but Mordecai and Rigby are left with the message they were holding.)

Mordecai: Aw man, it's just me, dude.
Rigby: Rigby?! No!

(He sees the phone message that says "Rigby" in the past and runs away.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (beat up) Mordecai and Rigby!

 We're trying to put together a really good team, but it's going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice to get here.

(The team members are playing cards. He picks two.)

Robbie: (gives a wink) Well, I'm a bit concerned with what we're going to do next. The rest of the team is gonna get a taste of this next round, and they're going to hear about the fact that our team didn't win tonight. (points at his cards) You said you're serious, dude. And I'm gonna do the same thing with you. I want you to come win another game of Magic.

Terrace: (whiskes and throws the card away) It's gonna get us nowhere!

Robby: (laughs) Oh, no. It really won't. We're too busy.

(The team members finally give up on the game. They play cards together.)

Robbie: (pointing) I know how to win this game, bro. But I'll tell you, the winner of this game of Magic wins this round. This was all planned, so I'm gonna go get you and your deck up.

(The team members all get out of their seats.)

Robbie: (closes the door) Let him see what we can get you if we do this.

Agnath: (holds up his hand) Good! If he doesn't see it, he can bet you he's wrong. (points at Robbie.)

Robbie: (grabs it) (puzzles the hand) Why not? There's only one point. I wanted to see you win the game tonight. You just have to get it together.

(He then gives it to Agnath and gets his deck up. Then Robbie and Rigby open the door)

Agnath: (looks at robbie) If you won't, we're gonna lose, bro.

Robbie: (looks at him as Robbie opens the door) What?! I don't know what I'm going to do?!

Agnath: (goes inside; his house is being invaded by a group of players. They all look frightened. They walk up to the house with robbie and robby staring into each other's eyes)

Robbie: (looks at Agnath) You better get up. We're gonna lose tonight. (pushes)

Robbie: (looks at him) You better get up, bro.

Agnath: (expects him) Yeah, dude. We were all gonna get up for a few games. When are we going to get up to play a game of Magic?

Robbie: (exhilariously) This game never stops. (walks up to him)

Robbie: (exhilariously) Yeah, we're gonna lose tonight. And all this will only get worse.

Agnath: (gestures to him) What are you gonna do? (exhilariously) You'll get outta here and we won't have another chance. If I lose, you'll just lose this game. You will never win another game of Magic anymore. I'm tired of playing in this room. (walks towards Agnath) Yeah, bro, I'm tired of playing out of this.

Robbie: (walks closer to Agnath) Well... (closes the door) Well, I can't say I want to lose because I'm tired of playing out of this. I'm tired of playing to win. Why play games if you're bored? Why put yourself in this situation, and play out of this.

Agnath: I can't. I know how to win this game. I'm tired of playing Magic. Why play games if you're bored? Why put yourself in this situation, and play to win.

Robbie: You're not a fool!

Agnath:I'm tired of playing it. I'm tired of thinking I can win. I'm tired of feeling lost. You can't win, bro.

Robbie: (continues and runs towards his house) Just go, and find myself...

Benson:No! Go get some coffee. (puts down his coffee cup)

Robbie:Okay, but don't worry about it. I don't want to lose. I know I just wanna do this.

Benson:So do you?

Robbie:Yes. So do I.

Benson:How often are you gonna get up to be there? You'll never win another game of Magic.

Robbie:I'll know if people come up to me for coffee.

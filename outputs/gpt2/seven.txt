Diane: I know, I'm not the perfect person. You're right. You're right. I wasn't like you. But I'm not the only one in this world that was wronged in some way.

(Flashback begins on the day of the murder trial)

Benson: Now then, in retrospect, I should have been a little more focused.

(Diane and Rigby head out of the courtroom)

Mordecai: (gasps) That wasn't really a big deal. All she was doing was defending herself against your mom. (She's heard the jury's instructions)

Rigby: I suppose that's fine. (They walk toward the courthouse for the Jury Chamber) I can't do anything else with my life.

(The jurors are all looking at the TV watching footage of the murder)

Rigby: They were all telling me what to do. But no one was saying a single word about what to do.

Mordecai: And even if you thought your mom was a murderer, then maybe now that she's out there with a gun, you don't really need to tell her anything.

Rigby: Oh, right. I mean, I'm not the only one.

Mordecai: This courtroom isn't perfect. But it'll never be the one where you're going. You're always free to go. (Benson enters and puts his hand on his forehead) I think I know if I'm lucky enough to be given a second chance.

Rigby: (starts the TV broadcasting)

Benson: Yeah, right, let me take you back to reality.

(Flashback begins with Benson talking to the jury)

Benson, Judge. (Mordecai and Rigby get out of the car on the freeway) I'm gonna have you here to prove it. If it didn't happen, what was my life? (In his voice) You're right, I don't even know what a jury is. But, I gotta say, I don't think the jury's pretty.

Michael: Yeah, right.

(Flashback ends. Michael is waiting for his car)

Mordecai: I'm gonna have you back.

(Scene changes to the police car. The police officers enter the car)

(The camera zooms out in front of the police car.)

Linda: That looks like she's taking this.

Benson: I thought you guys were going to do this.

Mordecai: Yeah, I had all my stuff from my past.

Rigby: And from my past, and it was gonna be a good show, but I thought in the past I'd do it myself.

Mordecai: What?!

Rigby: Aww, we got a new one tomorrow.

Mordecai: Oh, no, this is actually a new show. This is a new show!

(The police officers appear on camera and they all smile)

Rigby: Hey, we have a new episode, where they are trying to find a killer. This is a real show. (the door slams shut and the camera zoom out into the building)

Mordecai: Ugh! What's that?

Rigby: It's just the new stuff from there.

Rigby: It'll be alright.

(The camera zooms out so the cops are standing outside on the ground, but when they don't show up, the camera zooms out to show Benson. They all look very shaken.)

Mordecai: Benson.

(Benson and the police are in the back of the car. Benson walks out of the car.)

Benson: Uh, what could be that guy?

(The man with a weapon is shown through a window. He is looking through a gap in the back of the car when he sees a small child. The little boy, who is about 5 years old, is shown.)

Rigby: It's a guy with a big mouth. (breathes deep) Dude, heheh. He's...

(Benson comes out of the window, turns the kid's mouth around, and smiles. Benson then turns it back on.)

Benson: Hey! You know the thing that you're supposed to look at when you're an adult?

(Benson is holding a gun.)

Benson: (gasps) That's right, look right!

(He points at a piece of paper.)

Benson: Now that you've seen it, let's see. First, here's the picture. (looks
